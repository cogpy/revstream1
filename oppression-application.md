## Grounds for Oppression

### Ground 1: Interdiction from Office Access

**Allegation:**

Peter Andrew Faucitt **interdicted** Daniel James Faucitt from office access, preventing Daniel from:

1. **Exercising statutory director duties** for RegimA SA
2. **Participating in board decisions** affecting RegimA SA
3. **Overseeing company operations** and financial affairs
4. **Protecting company interests** from Peter's misconduct
5. **Accessing company records** and financial information

**Impact on Daniel:**

- Unable to fulfill fiduciary duties as director
- Unable to participate in governance of RegimA SA
- Unable to prevent revenue diversion to RST
- Unable to protect RegimA SA from Peter's fraud
- Exposed to personal liability for failing to perform director duties

**Evidence Required:**

- Access denial records
- Communications regarding interdiction
- Witness statements
- Director appointment records for Daniel at RegimA SA
- Security logs or access control records

**Legal Analysis:**

This conduct is **oppressive** under s163(1)(a) because:
- It prevents Daniel from exercising **statutory rights** as director
- It is **unfairly prejudicial** to Daniel's position as director
- It **unfairly disregards** Daniel's interests as director
- It impedes **proper governance** of RegimA SA
- It exposes Daniel to **personal liability** for failing to perform duties

**Burden of Proof:** 50% (civil) - **ACHIEVABLE** with interdiction documentation

---

### Ground 2: Facilitation of Revenue Hijacking

**Allegation:**

Peter's interdiction of Daniel was **calculated** to facilitate the hijacking of R10,269,727.90 in revenue from RegimA SA to RegimA Skin Treatments by:

1. **Preventing oversight:** Daniel could not oversee financial affairs
2. **Preventing intervention:** Daniel could not stop fraudulent records submission
3. **Preventing investigation:** Daniel could not investigate revenue diversions
4. **Preventing remedial action:** Daniel could not take action to protect RegimA SA

**The Fraud Chain:**

```
Peter (Director AB - dual director)
    ↓
    interdicts Daniel (prevents oversight)
    ↓
    instructs Rynette (employee with Sage control)
    ↓
    submits fraudulent records for RegimA SA
    ↓
    hijacks R10,269,727.90 to RST
```

**Financial Impact:**

- **Direct loss to RegimA SA:** R10,269,727.90
- **Loss to Daniel as director:** Share of company losses
- **Reputational harm:** Daniel unable to fulfill director duties

**Evidence:**

- Financial records showing R10,269,727.90 diversion
- Sage system control by Rynette (Pete@regima.com)
- Fraudulent records for RegimA SA
- Timeline showing interdiction preceded revenue diversion

**Legal Analysis:**

This conduct is **unfairly prejudicial** under s163(1)(a) because:
- Peter's interdiction **enabled** the revenue hijacking
- Daniel was **prevented** from protecting RegimA SA
- Daniel was **prevented** from protecting his own interests
- The conduct was **calculated** to exclude Daniel from governance
- The conduct caused **substantial financial harm**

**Burden of Proof:** 50% (civil) - **ACHIEVABLE** with financial records and interdiction timeline

---

### Ground 3: Breach of Director Equality

**Allegation:**

As **co-directors** of RegimA SA, Peter and Daniel have **equal rights** to:
- Participate in board decisions
- Access company information
- Exercise director duties
- Oversee company affairs

Peter's interdiction of Daniel **violated** this equality by:
- Unilaterally excluding Daniel from governance
- Denying Daniel access to company premises
- Preventing Daniel from exercising director rights
- Treating Daniel as subordinate rather than equal co-director

**Legal Analysis:**

This conduct is **oppressive** under s163(1)(a) because:
- It violates the **principle of director equality**
- It treats Daniel as **subordinate** to Peter
- It denies Daniel **statutory rights** as director
- It is **unfairly prejudicial** to Daniel's position
- It **unfairly disregards** Daniel's interests

**Burden of Proof:** 50% (civil) - **ACHIEVABLE** with director appointment records

---

### Ground 4: Conflict of Interest and Bad Faith

**Allegation:**

Peter's interdiction of Daniel was motivated by **bad faith** and **conflict of interest** because:

1. **Dual Director Status:** Peter serves as director of **both** RegimA SA and RegimA Skin Treatments (RST)

2. **Revenue Hijacking Plan:** Peter planned to divert revenue from RegimA SA to RST

3. **Removal of Oversight:** Peter needed to remove Daniel's oversight to execute the plan

4. **Calculated Exclusion:** Peter interdicted Daniel to facilitate the fraud

**Evidence:**

- Peter's dual director status (RegimA SA and RST)
- Financial records showing revenue diversion to RST
- Timeline showing interdiction preceded revenue diversion
- Lack of legitimate business reason for interdiction

**Legal Analysis:**

This conduct is **oppressive** and **unfairly prejudicial** because:
- Peter acted in **bad faith** toward Daniel
- Peter acted in **conflict of interest** (RST vs RegimA SA)
- Peter's motive was to **facilitate fraud** against RegimA SA
- Peter's conduct was **calculated** to harm RegimA SA and Daniel
- Peter **abused his position** as co-director

**Burden of Proof:** 50% (civil) - **ACHIEVABLE** with dual director evidence and financial records

## Coordination with s162 Delinquent Director Application

1. **Overlapping Evidence:** Both applications rely on similar evidence (revenue diversion, dual director status, interdiction)

2. **Complementary Relief:** s163 provides immediate relief for Daniel, while s162 provides long-term protection by removing Peter from directorship

3. **Consistent Narrative:** Both applications tell the same story of Peter's systematic misconduct

4. **Efficiency:** Filing both applications together reduces duplication and court time

**Recommendation:** File s163 and s162 applications **simultaneously** or in close succession

---

This application is **urgent** because:

1. **Ongoing Harm:** Daniel continues to be interdicted from exercising director duties

2. **Ongoing Revenue Diversion:** Peter may continue to divert revenue from RegimA SA

3. **Irreparable Harm:** Delay may cause further financial losses to RegimA SA

4. **Director Liability:** Daniel may be held personally liable for failing to perform director duties due to Peter's interdiction

**Recommendation:** File on an **urgent basis** seeking interim relief

---

## Interim Relief

### Pending Final Determination

The Court should grant **interim relief** pending final determination:

1. **Interim Interdict:**
   - Restraining Peter from preventing Daniel from exercising director duties
   - Requiring Peter to restore Daniel's access to RegimA SA premises

2. **Interim Oversight:**
   - Appointing an independent person to oversee RegimA SA financial affairs
   - Preventing further revenue diversion to RST

3. **Interim Accounting:**
   - Requiring Peter to account for all revenue received by RST from RegimA SA

**Legal Basis:** Balance of convenience favors Daniel and RegimA SA due to ongoing financial harm

---
