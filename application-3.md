[← Application 2](application-2.md) | [← Application 1](application-1.md) | [Back to Home](index.md) | [All Applications](applications.md)

---

## Overview

**Case Number:** 2025-137857  
**Application Type:** Urgent application  
**Filed:** November 4, 2025  
**Target:** Jacqueline only (First Respondent) - **Note:** Daniel excluded from this application  
**Hearing Date:** November 18, 2025  
**Status:** Pending hearing

---

## Relief Sought

1. **Dispensing with forms and service** (Rule 6(12)(a) urgency)
2. **Pending PART B of main application:** Jacqueline interdicted from having any contact with Third-Sixth Respondents (companies), their employees, partners, or clientele, **except through Applicant's attorneys during office hours**
3. **Costs on attorney-client scale** if opposed
4. **Further/alternative relief**

**Legal Significance:** This is the most restrictive of the three interdicts, essentially:
- Banning Jacqueline from her own companies
- Forcing all communication through Peter's attorneys
- Complete business isolation of a legitimate CEO and director

---

## Critical Timeline

### Key Deadlines

- **November 6, 2025 (12:00):** Notice of opposition deadline
- **November 11, 2025 (16:00):** Answering affidavit deadline
- **November 18, 2025:** Hearing date

### Events Leading to Application

**End of September 2025:**
- Jacqueline allegedly "commenced harassing" office personnel
- Demanded "salary" (applicant claims no salaries drawn for 2-3 years)
- Email to staff (Annexure AF5, September 30, 2025)

**September 29-30, 2025:**
- Jacqueline "threatened" to go to Regima's office
- Stated she would "tell all employees what's going on"
- Training session dispute (October 7-8, 2025 training)

**September 30, 2025:**
- Applicant's attorneys sent urgent correspondence demanding desistance
- Jacqueline undertook not to attend training session
- **Issue resolved - urgency eliminated**

**October 1, 2025:**
- Continued correspondence

**November 4, 2025:**
- Application filed (35+ days after events, 23+ days after undertaking given)

---

## Fatal Defect: Lack of Urgency

### Self-Created Urgency

**Standard:** Rule 6(12) requires genuine urgency, not self-created or tactical urgency.

**Facts:**
1. **35+ days delay:** Events occurred end of September; application filed November 4
2. **Issue resolved:** Jacqueline gave undertaking September 30 not to attend training
3. **No new events:** No incidents between September 30 and November 4
4. **Training already past:** October 7-8 training is over

**Legal Significance:** 
- Urgency is self-created and tactical
- Designed to prevent proper scrutiny of applicant's conduct
- Does not meet requirements for urgent relief under Rule 6(12)

### Timeline Proves Non-Urgency

```
September 30: Events occur + Jacqueline gives undertaking
      ↓
   35+ days
      ↓
November 4:   Application filed as "urgent"
      ↓
   14 days
      ↓
November 18:  Hearing date
```

If matter was truly urgent, why wait 35+ days?

## Sequential Pattern: Third Interdict in Three Months

This is the **third sequential interdict application** in three months:

### 1. August 13, 2025: [Ex Parte Interdict](application-1.md)
- **Type:** Ex parte urgent application
- **Targets:** Both Jacqueline and Daniel
- **Trigger:** POPIA violation notice (36 days prior)

### 2. October 2025: [Settlement Enforcement](application-2.md)

- **Evidence:** CIPC records prove financial statement fabrication

### 3. November 4, 2025: Contact Interdict (This Application)
- **Type:** Urgent application
- **Target:** Jacqueline only
- **Pattern:** Escalating restrictions, business isolation

**Analysis:** See [Sequential Interdicts Pattern Analysis](SEQUENTIAL_INTERDICTS_PATTERN_ANALYSIS.md)

**Legal Significance:** Three applications in three months demonstrates:
- Systematic abuse of process
- Pattern of retaliatory litigation
- Curatorship conspiracy progression

---

## Allegations in Application

### Section 6: "Escalation of Misconduct"

**Para 6.2-6.5:** End of September 2025
- Jacqueline "harassing" office personnel
- Demanded "salary"
- Email to staff (Annexure AF5, September 30, 2025)
- Referred to Regima's funds as "her money"

**Respondent's Context:**
<a name="email-evidence"></a>
Jacqueline is the **CEO and co-founder** with 33 years in position. Evidence shows:
- 📄 [Operating entity structures](evidence/emails/Fw_update-SomeInitialInformation&OperatingEntityLists-DanielFaucitt-Outlook.pdf) confirm her legitimate role
- 📄 [Corporate communications](evidence/emails/jaz-DanielFaucitt-Outlook.pdf) show her ongoing involvement
- She has every right to communicate with staff and inquire about salary
- Characterization as "harassment" is misrepresentation

**Para 6.6:** September 29-30, 2025
- Jacqueline "threatened" to tell employees "what's going on"
- Applicant claims this would be "enormously disruptive"

**Respondent's Context:**
What Jacqueline would tell employees:
1. [Shopify platform owned by Daniel's UK company](Revenue_Stream/02_Hijacking/SHOPIFY_REVENUE_REVELATION_ANALYSIS.md) since July 2023
2. [RWD ZA has no independent revenue stream](evidence-index-enhanced.md#shopify)
3. [Peter and Rynette seized ReZonance payment system](evidence/rezonance/FW_RezonceREZONANCE23,24,25FEBS-DanielFaucitt-Outlook.pdf)
4. [Peter and Rynette took control of Sage accounting](evidence/sage/SAGE_SCREENSHOTS_CONTROL_ANALYSIS.md.pdf)
5. [R10.27M in documented fraud](#revenue-hijacking)

**Legal Significance:** Applicant seeks to prevent exposure of his own misconduct by characterizing legitimate CEO communication as "harassment."

### Section 7: "Continued Escalation"

**Para 7.1:** September 30, 2025
- Jacqueline undertook not to attend training
- **Issue resolved**

**Para 7.2-7.5:** Since August 25, 2025
- Jacqueline demanded to be copied on all Regima correspondence

**Respondent's Context:**
As CEO and director, Jacqueline has:
- **Fiduciary duty** to be informed of company affairs
- **Legal right** to access company communications
- **Obligation** to oversee business operations

Applicant's position: CEO should be excluded from her own company communications.

## Evidence Contradicting Applicant's Narrative

### Shopify Platform Ownership

<a name="shopify-evidence"></a>
**Critical Revelation:** The Shopify platform has been owned and paid for since **July 2023** by Daniel's UK company **RegimA Zone Ltd**.

## Curatorship Conspiracy: Final Phase

### The Pattern Completes

This application represents the **final preparatory step** before curatorship application:

#### Phase 1: Business Isolation ✓
- [August 13, 2025: Ex Parte Interdict](application-1.md)
- Result: Initial business contact restrictions

#### Phase 2: Medical Labels ✓
- [October 2025: Settlement Enforcement](application-2.md)
- Goal: Psychiatric evaluation, drug screening
- Status: Opposed

#### Phase 3: Delinquency Allegations ✓ (This Application)
- **November 4, 2025: Contact Interdict**
- Goal: Paint Jacqueline as "dangerous," "harassing," "disruptive"
- Allegations: Harassment of employees, disruption of business
- **Effect:** Creates narrative of "delinquency" and "incapacity"

#### Phase 4: Curatorship Application (Anticipated)
- Use manufactured evidence from Phases 1-3
- Claim: Jacqueline "incapacitated" and "dangerous"
- Goal: Eliminate R18,685,000 debt to Bantjies via trust seizure

**Analysis:** [Curatorship Conspiracy Analysis Report](CURATORSHIP_CONSPIRACY_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md)

**Legal Significance:** This is not a legitimate protective measure but a step in coordinated conspiracy to establish grounds for curatorship.

## Legal Theories Supported by Evidence

### Theory 001: Abuse of Urgent Procedure

**Standard:** Rule 6(12) requires genuine urgency.

**Evidence:**
1. 35+ day delay between events and application
2. Issue resolved September 30 (undertaking given)
3. No new events after resolution
4. Self-created tactical urgency

**Conclusion:** Application does not meet urgency requirements.

### Theory 002: Retaliatory Motive - *Beinash v Wixley*

**Pattern of Sequential Applications:**
1. [July 8, 2025: POPIA violation notice](evidence/popia/POPIAViolationNotice-SenttoPeteon8July2025-DanielFaucitt-Outlook.pdf) → Aug 13: Application 1 (36 days)
2. [Sept 22: Withdrawal from settlement](#) → Oct: Application 2
3. Sept 30: Undertaking given → Nov 4: Application 3 (35 days)

**Evidence:** Each application follows legitimate action by respondents.

**Conclusion:** Clear retaliatory pattern across all three applications.

### Theory 003: Suppression of Truth

**What Jacqueline Would Tell Employees:**
1. [Shopify platform owned by Daniel](evidence-index-enhanced.md#shopify), not RWD ZA
2. [RWD ZA has no independent revenue stream](evidence-index-enhanced.md#shopify)
3. [ReZonance payment system seized](evidence/rezonance/FW_RezonceREZONANCE23,24,25FEBS-DanielFaucitt-Outlook.pdf) by Peter and Rynette
4. [Sage accounting seized](evidence/sage/SAGE_SCREENSHOTS_CONTROL_ANALYSIS.md.pdf) by Peter and Rynette
5. [R10.27M documented fraud](#revenue-hijacking)
6. [POPIA violations](evidence/popia/POPIAViolationNotice-SenttoPeteon8July2025-DanielFaucitt-Outlook.pdf) by Peter
7. [Trademark ownership](evidence/trademark/FW_Trademarkregistrationnos.UK00914297063REGIMAZONEinclasses03,05and44inthenameofREGIMASKINTREATMENTSCC[Witzref_CS2511.UK.03+]-DanielFaucitt-Outlook.pdf) misrepresented

**Conclusion:** Application seeks to prevent exposure of applicant's own misconduct.

### Theory 004: Curatorship Conspiracy

**This Application's Role:** Create "delinquency" narrative for curatorship basis.

**Evidence:**
1. Pattern across three applications
2. Escalating restrictions on legitimate CEO
3. Characterizing CEO duties as "harassment"
4. Timing aligns with curatorship setup phases

**Conclusion:** Part of coordinated conspiracy, not legitimate protective measure.

## Conclusion: The Complete Pattern

### Three Applications, One Purpose

1. **[Application 1](application-1.md):** Ex parte interdict - Initial isolation
2. **[Application 2](application-2.md):** Settlement enforcement - Medical labels
3. **Application 3:** Contact interdict - Delinquency allegations

**Result:** Complete business isolation of legitimate CEO, manufactured evidence of "incapacity" and "delinquency," preparation for curatorship application.

**Total Timeline:** March 15 - November 18, 2025 (247 days)
- 158 days of revenue hijacking (March-August)
- 89 days of sequential interdicts (August-November)

**Systematic Coordination Demonstrated:**
- Revenue stream hijacking creates "chaos"
- Ex parte interdict (concealing facts) isolates from business
- Settlement enforcement attempts medical labels
- Contact interdict creates delinquency narrative
- All evidence points to curatorship conspiracy
