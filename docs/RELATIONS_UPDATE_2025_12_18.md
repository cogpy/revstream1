## New Relations Identified

**From:** ORG_008 (Bantjies)  
**To:** ORG_003 (Strategic Logistics)  
**Type:** DEBT_DOCUMENTATION  
**Evidence:** SF1

**Description:** Ketoni R18.75M debt to FFT (Bantjies conflict as George Group CFO),000. This documentation reveals the complex inter-company debt structure that was used to extract capital and manipulate financial statements.

**Amount:** R18.75M (Ketoni debt to FFT)

**Significance:** This relationship demonstrates Bantjies' role as the accounting firm that created and documented the fraudulent debt structures. The large amount involved indicates systematic capital extraction.

### 2. Rynette Farrar → RegimA: SYSTEM_CONTROL

**From:** PERSON_002 (Rynette Farrar)  
**To:** ORG_002 (RegimA Skin Treatments)  
**Type:** SYSTEM_CONTROL  
**Evidence:** SF2

**Description:** Rynette Farrar had administrative control over the Sage accounting system used by RegimA Skin Treatments. This control enabled manipulation of financial records, journal entries, and reporting.

**Significance:** System-level control is critical evidence of the ability to manipulate financial records. This relationship establishes Rynette's technical capability to execute the accounting fraud.

### 3. Adderory → RegimA: STOCK_SUPPLY

**From:** ORG_014 (Adderory)  
**To:** ORG_002 (RegimA Skin Treatments)  
**Type:** STOCK_SUPPLY  
**Evidence:** SF5

**Description:** Adderory was registered as a company and established a stock supply relationship with RegimA. This relationship may have been created to facilitate revenue manipulation through fictitious or inflated stock transactions.

**Significance:** The creation of new entities with supply relationships is a common fraud technique to create artificial transactions and manipulate revenue recognition.

### 4. SARS → RegimA: TAX_AUDIT

**From:** ORG_015 (SARS)  
**To:** ORG_002 (RegimA Skin Treatments)

1. **Accounting Firm Complicity:** Bantjies' role in documenting fraudulent debt structures
2. **Technical Control:** Rynette's system access enabling record manipulation
3. **Entity Creation:** Adderory as a potentially fictitious or controlled supplier
