## Critical Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Systematic Coordination

Timeline reveals coordinated action across multiple crime categories:
- Revenue Theft: 7 events
- Trust Violations: 6 events
- Financial Manipulation: 12 events
- Accounting Fraud: 3 events
- Evidence Tampering: 2 events

**Legal Significance:** Supports charges of organized criminal enterprise

### Pattern 2: Shopify Platform Centrality

**Critical Finding:**
- Platform owned and paid for by RegimA Zone Ltd (UK) since July 2023
- 28+ months of continuous funding (R140K-R280K total investment)
- **RWD ZA has no independent revenue stream**

**Legal Significance:** Undermines applicant's claims of ownership and control

### Pattern 3: Evidence Destruction Pattern

Multiple evidence destruction events demonstrating consciousness of guilt:
- **May 22, 2025:** Shopify audit trail hijacking
- **August 20, 2025:** Financial evidence concealment
- **June 10, 2025:** Bantjies dismisses audit request

**Legal Significance:** Supports obstruction of justice charges

### Pattern 4: Family Conspiracy Elements

Coordinated actions across multiple family members:
- **Peter Faucitt:** Primary perpetrator (11 events)
- **Rynette Farrar:** Co-conspirator (8 events)
- **Addarory:** Domain registration identity fraud
- **Danie Bantjies:** Accountant with R18.75M (Ketoni debt to FFT) conflict of interest (3 events)

**Legal Significance:** Supports conspiracy charges under POCA
