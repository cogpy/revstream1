## Document Overview

This PowerPoint presentation documents the **sales workflow** for the RegimA e-commerce operations, showing the integration between **Shopify** (e-commerce platform), **Sage** (accounting system), and **Courier Guy** (delivery service). The workflow demonstrates how customer orders are processed from initial contact through to delivery and invoicing.

---

## Workflow Analysis

### Step 1: Customer Order Placement
**Actors:** Customer, Kent/EL (staff members)

**Process:**
- Customer contacts via **Phone** or **Email**
- Orders are placed to **Kent/EL** (staff members handling orders)

**Significance:**
- Identifies Kent and EL as key staff members handling customer orders
- Shows manual order entry process (phone/email)

---

### Step 2: Proforma Invoice Creation
**System:** Shopify  
**Actors:** Kent, EL

**Process:**
- **Shopify** creates proforma invoice
- Email proforma invoice to customer
- Kent and EL receive notification

**Significance:**
- Shopify is the primary e-commerce platform
- Automated proforma invoice generation
- Kent and EL have access to Shopify system

---

### Step 3: Payment Processing
**Actors:** Customer, Kent/EL

**Process:**
- Customer pays proforma invoice
- Email **POP (Proof of Payment)** to Kent/EL

**Significance:**
- Manual payment confirmation process
- Kent/EL verify payments before order fulfillment

---

### Step 4: Order Fulfillment
**System:** Shopify  
**Actors:** Kent, EL

**Process:**
- Kent/EL receive POP
- **Shopify** fulfills order
- Order marked as fulfilled in Shopify

**Significance:**
- Manual verification of payment before fulfillment
- Shopify tracks order fulfillment status

---

### Step 5: Accounting Integration (CRITICAL)
**System:** Sage Accounting  
**Integration:** Shopify → Sage (automatic)

**Process:**
- Once order is marked as fulfilled in Shopify
- Order data is **pulled through automatically** to Sage
- **Tax invoice is created & automatically emailed** to customer

**Significance:**
✅ **Automatic integration between Shopify and Sage**  
✅ **Tax invoices generated automatically** (not manually)  
✅ **Demonstrates system automation** and proper accounting practices  
✅ **Customer receives proper tax invoice** for SARS compliance

**Legal Relevance:**
- Proves automated accounting integration existed
- Shows proper tax invoice generation process
- Demonstrates system sophistication and automation
- Refutes claims of manual/improper accounting

---

### Step 6: Delivery Process
**System:** Courier Guy  
**Process:**
1. Shipment loaded on Courier Guy portal
2. Tracking number generated
3. Courier Guy collects parcels
4. Courier Guy delivers parcel or notifies if problem
5. Notification of delivery success/failure

**Significance:**
- Integrated delivery tracking system
- Automated notifications
- Professional logistics process

---

## Key Findings
