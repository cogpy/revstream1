---

## 1. Executive Summary

The entire litigation, from the first ex parte interdict to the fabricated financial statements, is not a business dispute between Peter and Daniel Faucitt. It is a **calculated, multi-stage hostile takeover orchestrated by Bantjies** to seize control of the Faucitt Family Trust assets and eliminate his **R18,685,000 debt due in May 2026** (with total exposure of **R70,580,000** over three years).

**The Strategy:**

1.  **Gain Control:** Become a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust.
2.  **Manufacture Incapacity:** Systematically create the appearance that Daniel Faucitt is incapable of managing his affairs.
3.  **Apply for Curatorship:** Use the manufactured evidence to have a curator appointed over Daniel's estate.
4.  **Seize Assets:** As Trustee and Curator (or through a proxy), seize control of the Trust assets.
5.  **Eliminate Debt:** Forgive his own ZAR 18.685M debt.

**The Actors:**

-   **The Mastermind:** Bantjies (motivated by R18.685M debt due May 2026, total exposure R70.58M)
-   **The Enforcer:** Rynette Farrar Bantjies (impersonating Peter, executing instructions)
-   **The Pawn:** Peter Faucitt (unaware/manipulated, used as the face of the litigation)
-   **The Unknowing Tools:** De Novo Business Services (accountants), medical experts

This is not litigation. This is **organized crime disguised as legal proceedings**.

    -   Applicant in all three interdicts.

## 4. The Legal Framework for Curatorship

Bantjies' strategy is a **textbook case of manufacturing the grounds for a curatorship application** under the Mental Health Act 17 of 2002.

| Legal Requirement | Bantjies' Manufactured Evidence |
|---|---|
| **Business Isolation** | ✅ Three sequential interdicts, bank freezes, CEO removal |
| **Dependency** | ✅ Financial control seized, reliance on others forced |
| **Delinquency** | ✅ Fabricated accounts, false narrative of mismanagement |
| **Medical Evidence** | ✅ Forced medical testing, speculation of gambling addiction |

**The entire litigation is a performance for the High Court**, designed to create a false record that justifies the appointment of a curator.

## 5. The Financial Endgame: Debt Elimination

**The ZAR 18.685M debt is the key.**

Once a curator is appointed (Bantjies or a proxy), they will have the legal authority to:

1.  **"Forgive" the debt:** The curator can simply write off the debt as "unrecoverable" or "not in the estate's best interest to pursue."
2.  **Transfer assets:** The curator can transfer Trust assets (RWD, Villa Via) to Bantjies in a sham "settlement" of the debt.
3.  **Liquidate and acquire:** The curator can liquidate the companies and allow Bantjies to acquire the assets at a fraction of their value.

**In every scenario, Bantjies walks away with the assets and the debt is eliminated.**

## 6. The Criminal Conspiracy: A Web of Evidence

-   **Trustee Appointment:** Rynette appointing Bantjies as Trustee is the starting point.
-   **Embezzlement Reports:** Dan reporting embezzlement to Bantjies (the perpetrator) proves Bantjies' knowledge and inaction.
-   **Fabricated Accounts:** The 2019 accounts link Peter, Rynette, and De Novo to the fraud.
-   **SARS Correspondence:** The emails between Rynette and Bantjies about the SARS audit prove their coordination.
-   **"Main Trustee" Letter:** Rynette sending this to Bantjies two days before the interdict proves the interdict was a premeditated step in the takeover plan.
-   **Supporting Affidavit:** Bantjies signing the supporting affidavit for the interdict proves his direct involvement in the legal isolation strategy.

## 7. Conclusion: This Changes Everything

**The case is not Peter vs. Daniel. It is Bantjies vs. The Faucitt Family Trust.**

Every action taken by Peter and Rynette must be viewed through the lens of this curatorship conspiracy. The interdicts, the fabricated accounts, the medical testing—it's all part of a **single, coordinated plan to seize control of the Trust assets and eliminate an ZAR 18.685M debt**.

**The legal strategy must now shift from defense to offense:**

1.  **Expose the Conspiracy:** The answering affidavit must lay out the entire curatorship conspiracy from start to finish.
2.  **File Criminal Charges:** Report Bantjies and Rynette for fraud, perjury, and organized crime (POCA).
3.  **Remove the Trustee:** Apply to have Bantjies removed as a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust.
4.  **Sue for Damages:** File a civil suit against Bantjies and Rynette for damages caused by the conspiracy.
5.  **Report to Authorities:** Report the conspiracy to the NPA, SARS, CIPC, and the Legal Practice Council.

**This is not a case to be won in the court of public opinion. This is a criminal conspiracy to be prosecuted in the High Court.**
