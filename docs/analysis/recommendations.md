## Key Arguments

### The "Forensic Time Capsule"

The Shopify Plus email (JF01) should be presented as a "forensic time capsule" that provides an unalterable historical record of the victims' independent business operations. This single piece of evidence demolishes the perpetrators' claims of centralized control.

### The "Smoking Gun"

The Sage screenshots showing Rynette Farrar's dual access to the system (SF2) should be presented as the "smoking gun" that proves criminal intent. This evidence is direct, irrefutable, and easy for a judge or jury to understand.

### The Pattern of Deception

The legal team should emphasize the clear pattern of deception that is evident from the correspondence (JF05), the financial records (JF03), and the timeline of events. This pattern demonstrates that the fraud was not a one-time event, but a deliberate and coordinated scheme.

## Evidence Presentation

### Visual Timeline

An interactive visual timeline should be created to present the key events and the associated evidence in a clear and compelling manner. This will help the judge or jury to understand the chronology of the fraud and the connections between the different pieces of evidence.

### Entity Relationship Diagram

An entity relationship diagram should be created to visually represent the relationships between the perpetrators, the victims, and the various corporate entities. This will help to illustrate the complexity of the scheme and the roles of the different actors.
