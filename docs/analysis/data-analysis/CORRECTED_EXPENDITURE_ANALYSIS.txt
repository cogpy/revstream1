====================================================================================================
CORRECTED EXPENDITURE ANALYSIS: Daniel's Personal Bank Account (May-October 2025)
====================================================================================================

KEY CORRECTION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All transfers INTO the account were from Daniel's PERSONAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNT,
EXCEPT the R500,000 from Strategic Logistics on July 16, 2025.

This means:
1. Daniel was funding his personal account from his OWN savings/investments
2. The R500k was the ONLY external transfer (reimbursement from his company)
3. Total expenditures show the true cost of company expenses on his personal card
