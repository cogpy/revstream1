   - Was this triggered by legal proceedings in case 2025-137857?
   - Was this required for regulatory compliance or court disclosure?

3. **What is Unicorn Dynamics (Pty) Ltd?**
   - Who owns and controls it?
   - What is the nature of the R500 loan?
   - Is it another shell company in the network?

4. **What is the relationship between RegimaSA and ReZonance?**

## 10. Conclusion

The RegimaSA (Pty) Ltd 2019 financial statements reveal a **shell company structure** with **no legitimate business operations**, controlled jointly by **Peter Faucitt (PERSON_001)** and **Daniel Faucitt (PERSON_005)**. The company's only activity was maintaining minimal bank accounts and engaging in related party loans with **ReZonance (ORG_008)** and **Unicorn Dynamics (ORG_013)**.

The **retrospective preparation** of these financial statements in **June 2025** - more than 6 years after the period end - is highly suspicious and suggests strategic document preparation in response to legal proceedings in case 2025-137857.

This evidence further establishes:
1. **Peter's control** over Regima Group entities
2. **Daniel's financial investment** and directorship
3. **Related party network** including ReZonance and Unicorn Dynamics
4. **Shell company structure** used for financial manipulation
5. **Retrospective document preparation** for legal defense

All findings should be integrated into the data models and cross-referenced with existing evidence in the revstream1 and ad-res-j7 repositories.
