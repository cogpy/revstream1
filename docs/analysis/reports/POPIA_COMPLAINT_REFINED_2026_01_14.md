## 1. Introduction

This complaint details serious violations of the Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013 (POPIA) by Ms. Rynette Farrar and her co-conspirators. The evidence demonstrates the unlawful and intentional interception of personal information and the failure to secure the integrity and confidentiality of personal information against loss, damage, or unauthorized destruction.

## 2. Key Parties

| Entity ID | Name | Role | POPIA Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PERSON_002** | Rynette Farrar | Co-conspirator, Financial Controller | Responsible Party (de facto) |
| **PERSON_001** | Peter Andrew Faucitt | Director | Responsible Party |
| **ORG_001** | Regima Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd | Responsible Party | Failed to secure data |

## 3. Unlawful Interception and Processing of Personal Information

Ms. Rynette Farrar, without the consent of the data subjects, unlawfully accessed and processed personal information, including email communications. This was a direct violation of Section 11 of POPIA, as there was no legitimate basis for this processing.

- **Evidence:** The conclusive evidence in `ad-res-j7/ANNEXURES/SF2` (Sage Screenshots) demonstrates Ms. Farrar's unauthorized access to the email account `Pete@regima.com`. This gave her access to a trove of personal and business information, which was subsequently used to perpetrate fraud.

## 4. Failure to Secure Personal Information

As directors and responsible parties, Mr. Peter Faucitt and the corporate entities had a legal duty under Section 19 of POPIA to secure the integrity and confidentiality of personal information in their possession or under their control. They failed to take appropriate, reasonable technical and organizational measures to prevent the unlawful access to and use of this information.

- **Evidence:** The successful and sustained fraudulent scheme, which was predicated on the unauthorized access to information, is in itself prima facie evidence of a failure to implement adequate security safeguards. The ease with which Ms. Farrar could impersonate another user and manipulate financial data, as shown in `ad-res-j7/ANNEXURES/JF07`, highlights a complete breakdown of security controls.

## 5. Conclusion and Request for Investigation

The violations of POPIA detailed in this complaint are not minor infractions; they are serious criminal offenses that were instrumental in facilitating a multi-million rand fraud. The evidence is clear, compelling, and meets the threshold for criminal prosecution.

We respectfully request that the Information Regulator conduct a full investigation into these matters and refer the case to the National Prosecuting Authority for criminal prosecution under the relevant sections of POPIA.
