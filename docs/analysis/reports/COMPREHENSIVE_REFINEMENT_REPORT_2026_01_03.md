1. **Core Data Models:** Direct links to entities, relations, events, and timeline JSON files
2. **Evidence Index:** Links to the AD-RES-J7 evidence index and key evidence mapping
3. **Key Evidence Highlights:** Table of the 11 most critical pieces of evidence
4. **Visualizations:** Links to timeline and network graph images
5. **Legal Filings:** Links to the latest refined CIPC complaint, POPIA complaint, and NPA report

All data models, analysis files, legal filings, and visualizations have been copied to the `docs/` directory for GitHub Pages deployment.

## V. Recommendations for Next Steps

### A. Immediate Actions

1. **Submit Legal Filings:** The refined CIPC complaint, POPIA complaint, and NPA tax fraud report are ready for submission to the relevant authorities.

2. **Evidence Consolidation:** Consider creating a master evidence package that consolidates the 11 key evidence items with their supporting documentation.

3. **Timeline Gap Analysis:** Investigate the 483-day gap between 2023-09-20 and 2025-01-15 to identify any missing events or evidence.

### B. Strategic Considerations

1. **Criminal vs. Civil Strategy:** With 46 events meeting the criminal threshold, there is a strong case for prioritizing criminal proceedings, which may strengthen the civil case.

2. **Parallel Proceedings:** Consider filing the CIPC complaint, POPIA complaint, and NPA report simultaneously to create pressure on multiple fronts.

3. **Curatorship Fraud Investigation:** The evidence suggests a potential curatorship fraud scheme. This should be investigated further and potentially reported to the relevant authorities.

4. **Ketoni Payout Protection:** With the ZAR 18.75M payout from Ketoni due in May 2026, urgent action may be required to protect this asset from misappropriation.

### C. Evidence Development

1. **Witness Statements:** Identify and secure witness statements from individuals mentioned in the evidence (e.g., Gee, Bernadine Wright, Marisca Meyer).

2. **Financial Forensics:** Consider engaging a forensic accountant to provide an expert report on the financial manipulation and transfer pricing fraud.

3. **Digital Forensics:** The evidence of email control and system manipulation may benefit from a formal digital forensics investigation.

## VI. Conclusion

The comprehensive refinement of the data models, evidence cross-references, and legal filings has established a robust, evidence-based foundation for legal action against the perpetrators of the Revenue Stream Hijacking scheme. The identification of 46 criminal threshold events, the cataloguing of 785 evidence files, and the enhancement of entity and relation evidence strength demonstrate the depth and breadth of the case.

The case is now well-positioned for submission to the relevant authorities, with clear evidence of criminal conduct, civil violations, and regulatory breaches. The organized GitHub Pages deployment ensures that all evidence is accessible, cross-referenced, and ready for presentation in legal proceedings.
