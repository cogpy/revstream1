*   Cross-references to the ad-res-j7 repository.
*   Evidence strength assessments (conclusive, strong, moderate).
*   Criminal threshold indicators where applicable.

#### Relations (75 Total)
*   **Ownership relations**: Documenting legitimate and fraudulent ownership structures.
*   **Control relations**: Mapping financial and operational control.

All relations now include:
*   Confidence scores (0.0 to 1.0).

*   **Phase 3 (Exposure)**: 48 events documenting the discovery and documentation of the fraud.

**Critical Fix Applied:** 10 events were missing perpetrators/victims. These have been identified and added based on contextual analysis:
*   EVENT_091, EVENT_089, EVENT_090, EVENT_088, EVENT_086, EVENT_087, EVENT_067, EVENT_SF2A, EVENT_SF2B, EVENT_SF9.

All events now include:
*   Burden of proof assessments (criminal 95%, civil 50%+, civil 50%).
*   Perpetrators and victims clearly identified.
*   Evidence references from both repositories.
*   Phase classifications for timeline organization.

### 2. Timeline Visualizations

Three comprehensive timelines have been generated in Mermaid format:

1.  **Comprehensive Timeline** (`comprehensive_timeline_fixed.mmd`): All 77 events from 2017 to 2025.
2.  **Criminal Events Timeline** (`criminal_events_timeline_fixed.mmd`): The 7 events meeting the 95% criminal threshold.
3.  **Phase Timeline** (`phase_timeline_fixed.mmd`): Events organized by the three investigation phases.

All timelines include:
*   Burden of proof indicators ([CRIMINAL], [CIVIL+]).
*   Sanitized descriptions for proper rendering.
*   PNG renderings for easy viewing.

### 3. GitHub Pages Organization

The GitHub Pages documentation has been reorganized for clarity and accessibility:

*   **Enhanced Evidence Index** (`docs/evidence-index-enhanced.md`): 328 evidence files cataloged with direct links to the ad-res-j7 repository.
*   **Timeline Section** (`docs/timelines/README.md`): All timeline visualizations with embedded images.
*   **Filings Section** (`docs/filings/`): Organized legal filings with the latest refinements.

**Key Improvements:**
*   Removed outdated and duplicate files.
*   Standardized naming conventions.
*   Added Jekyll configuration for GitHub Pages theming.
*   Cross-referenced all evidence to the ad-res-j7 repository.

### 4. Legal Filings Refinement

Three key legal filings have been refined based on the latest evidence and analysis:

#### CIPC Complaint (Section 162 Delinquent Director Application)
*   **File:** `docs/filings/CIPC_COMPLAINT_REFINED_2026_01_02.md`
*   **Focus:** Delinquency of Peter Faucitt and Rynette Farrar.
*   **Evidence:** 7 criminal threshold events + 43 civil threshold events.
