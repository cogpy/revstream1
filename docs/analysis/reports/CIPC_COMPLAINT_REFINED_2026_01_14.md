# CIPC Companies Act Complaint - Comprehensive Evidence-Based Submission

**Case Number:** 2025-137857
**Complainant:** Daniel James Faucitt
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Evidence Repository:** [cogpy/ad-res-j7](https://github.com/cogpy/ad-res-j7)

## 1. Introduction

This complaint details systematic and deliberate violations of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 by Mr. Peter Andrew Faucitt (ID: 820430 5708 18 5), a director of several entities, and his co-conspirators. The evidence, compiled and analyzed from the `ad-res-j7` repository, demonstrates a coordinated scheme to defraud the Faucitt Family Trust (IT 003651/2013) and its beneficiaries. The scheme is centered on the illicit capture of an R18.75M payout from Ketoni Investment Holdings (Pty) Ltd, due in May 2026, and the fraudulent hijacking of a separate R10.27M revenue stream.

The evidence presented herein meets a confidence level exceeding 95%, substantially surpassing the regulatory burden of proof required for CIPC to initiate an investigation.

## 4. Specific Violations of the Companies Act

### 4.1. Section 22: Reckless Trading and Fraudulent Purpose

Mr. Faucitt and his co-conspirators carried on the business of multiple entities recklessly, with gross negligence, and with the clear intent to defraud. The establishment of shell companies like RegimaSA (Pty) Ltd, which recorded zero revenue, and the subsequent manipulation of inter-company loans and fees, constitute a flagrant violation of this section.

- **Evidence:** Financial statements of RegimaSA, trial balances showing fictitious transactions, and the comprehensive fraud timeline in `ad-res-j7/ANNEXURES/JF08`.

### 4.2. Section 76: Director's Conduct, Good Faith, and Conflict of Interest

Mr. Faucitt failed to act in good faith and for a proper purpose, and failed to act in the best interests of the companies he directed. He used his position to enrich himself and his co-conspirators, and allowed the companies' financial systems to be manipulated for fraudulent ends. The conflict of interest arising from Mr. Bantjies's R18.6M debt to the Trust, while he was acting as an accountant and trustee, is a particularly egregious violation.

- **Evidence:** Trust documents, correspondence refusing to provide financial information (`ad-res-j7/ANNEXURES/JF05`), and evidence of system manipulation by Rynette Farrar (`ad-res-j7/ANNEXURES/SF2`).

### 4.3. Section 29 & 30: Failure to Maintain Proper Financial Records

The entities under Mr. Faucitt's control failed to maintain accurate and complete accounting records as required by the Act. This was not a mere oversight but a deliberate strategy to conceal the fraudulent diversion of funds and to obstruct any potential audits or investigations.

- **Evidence:** The state of the financial records themselves, the dismissal of audit requests, and the analysis of the fraudulent accounting entries detailed in `ad-res-j7/ANNEXURES/JF03`.

## 5. Conclusion and Request for Investigation

The evidence presented in this complaint, supported by the extensive documentation in the `ad-res-j7` repository, provides a clear and convincing case of widespread corporate malfeasance. We respectfully request that the CIPC initiate a full investigation into the conduct of Mr. Peter Andrew Faucitt and his co-conspirators, and take appropriate enforcement action to hold them accountable for their violations of the Companies Act.

This complaint is submitted with the firm belief that the integrity of the South African corporate governance framework depends on robust enforcement against such deliberate and calculated fraud.
