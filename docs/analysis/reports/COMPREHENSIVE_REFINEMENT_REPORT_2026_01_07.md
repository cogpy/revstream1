   - 2025-04 (4 criminal events)
   - 2025-05 (4 criminal events)

### 7.2. Medium Priority

1. **Map timeline events to specific paragraphs** in legal applications
2. **Add cumulative financial impact tracking** to timeline entries
3. **Create phase transition markers** in timeline (PHASE_1 → PHASE_2 → PHASE_3)

### 7.3. Low Priority

1. **Generate additional visualizations** (timeline charts, network graphs)
2. **Create evidence strength heatmaps** by category
3. **Develop interactive evidence browser** for GitHub Pages
