**Last Updated:** 2026-01-14

This analysis details how the evidence in case 2025-137857 meets both the 50% burden of proof required for civil claims and the 95% burden of proof required for criminal prosecution.

---

## Civil Claims (50% Burden of Proof)

The standard for civil claims is a "preponderance of the evidence," meaning that it is more likely than not that the claims are true. The evidence in this case far exceeds this standard.

**Key Evidence:**
- **[JF01: Shopify Plus Email](../../evidence/critical.md#jf01-shopify-plus-email-26-july-2017---the-forensic-time-capsule):** Establishes the independent business operations of the victims.
- **[JF03: Financial Records](../../evidence/financial.md#jf03-financial-records-and-analysis):** Shows the financial damages incurred.
- **[JF05: Correspondence Evidence](../../evidence/correspondence.md):** Reveals the deceptive conduct of the perpetrators.

## Criminal Prosecution (95% Burden of Proof)

The standard for criminal prosecution is "beyond a reasonable doubt," which requires a much higher level of certainty. The evidence in this case meets this standard for numerous criminal charges.

**Key Evidence:**
- **[SF2: Sage Screenshots - Rynette Control](../../evidence/critical.md#sf2-sage-screenshots---rynette-control):** Is direct, "smoking gun" evidence of criminal intent.
- **[JF07: Sage System Screenshots](../../evidence/critical.md#jf07-sage-system-screenshots-and-payment-records):** Provides a clear and irrefutable record of the fraudulent transactions.
- **[JF08: Evidence Package](../../evidence/critical.md#jf08-evidence-package-20251012---comprehensive-fraud-timeline):** Details the criminal conspiracy in its entirety.
