## 1. The Financial Motive

**Bantjies' Debt (Call Option Agreement):**

| Year | Due Date | Amount | Status |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| **Year 1** | **May 2026** | **R18,685,000** | **~6 months remaining** |
| Year 2 | May 2027 | R23,165,000 | ~18 months |
| Year 3 | May 2029 | R28,730,000 | ~42 months |
| **TOTAL** | | **R70,580,000** | **Total exposure** |

**Creditors:** Peter Faucitt & Jacqueline Faucitt

**Problem:** Bantjies cannot pay the first installment (R18.685M) due in May 2026.

**Deadline:** **~6 months remaining** (as of November 2025)

**Solution:** Seize control of the Trust assets through curatorship before May 2026, eliminate the debt, and dispossess the creditors.

## 2. The Trust Control Mechanism

### 2.1. Trust Structure

**Faucitt Family Trust:**
- **Owns:** RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd
- **Owns:** Villa Via Arcadia (Pty) Ltd
- **Controls:** Financial investments of owned companies
- **Trustees:** Have legal authority to control Trust assets

### 2.2. Trustee Appointment

**Date:** July 7, 2024  
**Action:** Rynette Farrar Bantjies appoints **Bantjies** as Trustee to the Faucitt Family Trust

**Legal Effect:**
- Bantjies gains legal control over Trust assets
- Bantjies can control financial investments of RWD and Villa Via
- Bantjies can manipulate company finances

## 3. The Financial Sabotage Strategy

### 3.1. Push RWD into Insolvency

**Method:**
- Load expenses onto RWD
- Block revenue stream (Shopify platform fees from UK)
- Create appearance of financial mismanagement

**Evidence:**
- Dan's embezzlement reports (June 6, 10, 2025)
- Card cancellation (June 7, 2025)
- R1.06M in expenses forced onto Dan's personal card

**Outcome:**
- RWD appears insolvent
- Dan appears to be mismanaging finances
- Justification for intervention

### 3.2. Extract Funds Through Villa Via

**Method:**
- Charge excessive rent to RegimA Group
- 86% profit margin on rent charges
- Push RegimA Group into losses

**Evidence:**
- Dan's embezzlement reports (June 6, 10, 2025)
- Villa Via financial records

**Outcome:**
- Villa Via profits while RegimA Group loses
- Funds extracted from operating companies
- Trust assets depleted

### 3.3. SARS Pressure & Inside Information

**Method:**
- SARS audit of large transactions
- Anton (SARS Official) provides inside information
- Rynette & Bantjies coordinate response

**Evidence:**
- Email correspondence (Rynette & Bantjies arguing about responsibility)
- Anton's involvement

**Outcome:**
- Additional pressure on Dan & Jax
- Justification for "financial irregularities" narrative
- Cover for fabricated accounts

## 4. The Curatorship Path

### 4.1. Legal Requirements for Curatorship

**Mental Health Act 17 of 2002, s 61:**

A person may be declared incapable of managing their affairs if:
1. **Business isolation** - Unable to conduct business
2. **Dependency** - Dependent on others for financial decisions
3. **Delinquency** - Pattern of poor financial management
4. **Medical evidence** - Psychiatric evaluation supporting incapacity

### 4.2. Bantjies' Strategy to Meet Requirements

| Requirement | Bantjies' Action | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Business Isolation** | Sequential interdicts, bank freezes, CEO removal | 3 applications (Aug, Oct, Nov 2025) |
| **Dependency** | Force Dan to rely on Peter/Bantjies for financial access | Card cancellation, bank freezes |
| **Delinquency** | Create appearance of financial mismanagement | Fabricated accounts, embezzlement narrative |
| **Medical Evidence** | Forced medical testing, gambling addiction speculation | Psychologist report (despite bank statements) |

### 4.3. The Curatorship Application (Planned 2026)

**Applicant:** Likely Peter Faucitt (as proxy for Bantjies)

**Grounds:**
1. Daniel unable to manage business (isolated by interdicts)
2. Daniel dependent on others (bank accounts frozen)
3. Daniel delinquent in financial management (fabricated narrative)
4. Medical evidence of incapacity (forced testing)

**Proposed Curator:** Bantjies or Bantjies-controlled proxy

**Outcome:**
- Curator gains control of Dan's affairs
- Curator controls Trust assets (as Trustee)
- Bantjies eliminates ZAR 18.685M debt
- Pete & Jax dispossessed of Trust assets

---

## 5. The Financial Endgame

### 5.1. Asset Control

**If curatorship granted:**
- Bantjies (as Trustee) controls Trust
- Bantjies (as Curator or proxy) controls Dan's affairs
- **Total control of all assets**

### 5.2. Debt Elimination

**Method 1: Forgiveness**
- Curator "forgives" Bantjies' debt as "in Dan's best interest"
- ZAR 18.685M eliminated

**Method 2: Asset Transfer**
- Curator transfers Trust assets to Bantjies
- "Payment" for debt
- Assets worth far more than debt

**Method 3: Liquidation**
- Curator liquidates companies
- Bantjies acquires assets at liquidation prices
- Debt eliminated through "settlement"

### 5.3. Dispossession

**Pete & Jax:**
- Lose Trust assets
- Lose ZAR 18.685M debt repayment
- Silenced by interdicts and curatorship

**Dan & Jax:**
- Lose business control
- Lose financial independence
- Declared "incapable" by court
