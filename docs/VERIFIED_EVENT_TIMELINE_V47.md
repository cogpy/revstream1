## KEY OBSERVATIONS FROM VERIFIED DATA

- Trust Number: IT 003651/2013
- Founder: Peter Andrew Faucitt
- Original Trustees (2013): Peter and Jacqueline only
- Beneficiaries: Peter, Jacqueline, and Daniel James Faucitt
- Bantjes was Trust Accountant in 2013, now Trustee (as of 2024)

**UNVERIFIED:**

### 2. Company Membership Patterns

**VERIFIED from B2Bhint:**

| Company | Peter | Jacqueline | Daniel |
|---------|-------|------------|--------|
| Regima Skin Treatments (1992) | ✓ Member | ✓ Member | ✗ NOT |
| Villa Via Arcadia No 2 (1996) | ✓ Member | ✓ Member | ✗ NOT |
| CorpClo 2304 (2005) | ✓ Member | ✓ Member | Unknown |
| Strategic Logistics (2008) | Unknown | ✓ Member | ✓ Member |
| RWD (2011) | ✓ Director | ✓ Director | Unknown |
| ReZonance (2017) | ✗ NOT | ✗ NOT | ✓ Director |

**Key Finding:** Daniel is NOT a member of the older CCs (Villa Via, Regima Skin Treatments) where Peter and Jacqueline are members.

### 3. Trust vs CIPC Records Discrepancy

**Trust Deed Declaration (2013) states:**
> "The main assets of the trust are to be situated at: 20 River Road, Morninghill, Bedfordview."

**CIPC Records show:**
- Companies at 20 River Road list Peter/Jacqueline as directors/members
- CIPC does NOT show FFT as shareholder/member

**Implication:** Either:
1. Peter/Jacqueline hold shares as nominees for FFT (requires verification)
2. Trust assets are different from company ownership (requires clarification)
3. CIPC records not updated to reflect trust ownership (requires investigation)

### 4. Bantjes Connection

**VERIFIED:**
- 2013: Bantjes was Trust Accountant (Practice #944130)
- 2024: Bantjes is Trustee (per J246)

**UNVERIFIED:**
- When Bantjes transitioned from Accountant to Trustee
- Who appointed Bantjes as Trustee
