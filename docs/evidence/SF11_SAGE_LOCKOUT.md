# Evidence SF11: Sage Subscription Lockout

**Date:** 2025-08-25 (Screenshot Date)  
**Event Date:** 2025-07-23 (Subscription Expiry)

## Description

A screenshot of the Sage accounting system login page shows that the subscription for RegimA Worldwide Distribution expired on **July 23, 2025**. The registered owner of the subscription is **Rynette Farrar**.

## Significance

This act constitutes **deliberate evidence concealment and obstruction of justice**.

1.  **Timing:** The subscription was allowed to expire just **21 days before** the fraudulent interdict was filed against Jacqueline and Daniel Faucitt (August 13, 2025).
2.  **Control:** As the registered owner, only Rynette Farrar could reactivate the subscription. By letting it expire, she effectively locked all parties, including the directors, out of the system.
3.  **Obstruction:** This act denied the rightful directors and shareholders access to their own financial data precisely when they needed it to defend themselves against the false allegations in the interdict.
4.  **Consciousness of Guilt:** This deliberate act of concealment demonstrates a clear consciousness of guilt and an attempt to hide the fraudulent activities that had taken place within the accounting system.

This is a direct violation of POPIA (Section 107(2) - Obstruction) and is a key piece of evidence in the criminal complaint.
