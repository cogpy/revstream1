## Description

On 26 November 2025, Elliott Attorneys (Ref: KRE/MM/KL0034) sent a letter of demand on behalf of Rynette Farrar to Pottas Attorneys, claiming that allegations made by Jacqueline Faucitt in her answering affidavit were "defamatory, injurious and factually incorrect." Rynette Farrar subsequently opened a case of perjury against Jacqueline Faucitt.

This evidence matrix was prepared to demonstrate that the allegations are **TRUE** and supported by documentary evidence.

## Summary Scorecard

| Category | Count | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Allegations FULLY PROVEN | 5 of 8 | ✅ Proven |
| Allegations PARTIALLY PROVEN | 2 of 8 | ⚠️ Partial |
| Allegations Supported by Pattern | 1 of 8 | Supported |
| Allegations DISPROVEN | **0 of 8** | **None** |

**Result:** Not a single allegation has been disproven. The perjury complaint is entirely without merit.

## Additional Criminal Conduct Identified

The documentary evidence reveals additional criminal conduct not yet charged:

1.  **Identity Impersonation (Forgery):** Rynette signed trust documents "pp Peter" on 28 June 2024, forging Peter's signature to install Bantjies as trustee.
2.  **Email Impersonation (ECTA s87):** Controlled `Pete@regima.com` (proved by Sage screenshots), sending/receiving correspondence as Peter without disclosure.
3.  **Evidence Destruction (Obstruction):** Shopify audit trails deleted 22 May 2025 — 77 days after the R900,000 unauthorised transfers.
4.  **Identity Appropriation:** Kayla Pretorius's business phone number (011 615 29869) transferred to Rynette after Kayla's death in July 2023.
5.  **Self-Appointment:** Email signature shows "FINANCE MANAGER AICB(SA)" despite being employed as bookkeeper.
6.  **Facilitating Perjured Affidavit:** Emailed signed "Main Trustee" appointment to Bantjies on 11 August 2025, 3-8 days before the perjured ex parte interdict application.
7.  **Two Years of Non-Reconciliation:** As bookkeeper, failed to reconcile any transactions from August 2023 to May 2025, creating the conditions for undetected theft.

## Significance

This evidence matrix proves that Rynette Farrar's perjury complaint is a **false criminal report** and an attempt at **obstruction of justice**. The complaint should be dismissed and counter-charges filed.

## Legal Framework

*   **Perjury Defence (Truth):** If the statements are true, perjury cannot be established. This matrix proves the statements are true.
*   **Absolute Privilege:** Statements made in court pleadings enjoy absolute privilege under South African law (May v Udwin 1981; Naidoo v Moodley 2006). The defamation claim is legally misconceived.
*   **False Criminal Report:** Filing the perjury complaint knowing the allegations are true constitutes: (a) filing a false criminal complaint; (b) defeating or obstructing the course of justice; and (c) attempt to suppress evidence in pending litigation.
