Attention: Nondu Motlhala

**Subject: Issuing replacement cards - Account number 62323196362**

Following my recent written request to cancel the 3 x debit cards on the above account due to suspected fraud, I now believe that you intend to issue one or more replacement cards which may allow the perpetuation of the suspected fraud before any internal or external investigation of my allegations can be carried out by our auditors. This action may place FNB in the untenable position of being an accessory after the fact, should such fraud be proven by any subsequent investigations, and may hold FNB liable for any future losses incurred by our company due to the re-issuance of these cards. I strongly advise that you speak to your legal department before such action is taken.

I also believe that due to the amount of dollar-based subscription expense passing through this account our company may be transgressing the Exchange Control Regulations, and if so, any such internation remittances should be suspended forthwith.

I would appreciate your swift response to my request forthwith.

Regards

Peter Andrew Faucitt - Director

## Legal Significance Analysis

### 1. Timeline Context

| Date | Event | Days After |
|------|-------|------------|
| 2025-06-06 | Dan exposes Villa Via fraud to Bantjies | T-0 |
| 2025-06-07 | Cards cancelled <24 hours after fraud exposure | T+1 |
| **2025-06-17** | **This letter written** | **T+11** |

This letter was written **11 days after** Dan exposed the fraud to Bantjies and **10 days after** the card cancellation.

### 2. Key Admissions by Peter Faucitt

1. **Suspected Fraud Acknowledgment**: Peter explicitly states "suspected fraud" - acknowledging awareness of fraudulent activity on the account
2. **Prior Card Cancellation Request**: Confirms he made a "recent written request to cancel the 3 x debit cards" due to suspected fraud
3. **Ongoing Fraud Concern**: States concern that "perpetuation of the suspected fraud" could continue
4. **Auditor Investigation Pending**: Mentions "internal or external investigation of my allegations can be carried out by our auditors"
5. **Exchange Control Violations**: Acknowledges potential "transgressing the Exchange Control Regulations" due to "dollar-based subscription expense"

### 3. Contradictions with Peter's Court Filings

This letter **directly contradicts** Peter's position in court filings where he claims:
- Dan and Jax are the perpetrators
- Peter is the victim

However, this letter shows:
- Peter was aware of fraud on the RWD account
- Peter was taking action to stop the fraud
- Peter was concerned about FNB's liability as "accessory after the fact"
- Peter acknowledged potential Exchange Control violations by "our company"

### 4. Evidence of Rynette's Control

The letterhead shows:
- **E-mail: rynette@regima.zone** - Rynette's email is the primary contact
- This confirms Rynette's operational control of RWD as documented elsewhere

### 5. Legal Implications

| Implication | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Fraud Awareness** | Peter was aware of suspected fraud on RWD account |
| **Accessory After Fact** | Peter warned FNB about being an "accessory after the fact" - this same standard applies to Peter |
| **Exchange Control** | Peter acknowledged potential SARB Exchange Control violations |
| **Auditor Investigation** | Peter mentioned pending auditor investigation - status unknown |

## Evidence Cross-References

| Evidence ID | Description | Relevance |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| EVENT_086 | Dan exposes fraud to Bantjies (2025-06-06) | 11 days before this letter |
| EVENT_087 | Cards cancelled (2025-06-07) | 10 days before this letter |
| JF08 | Comprehensive fraud evidence package | Corroborates fraud allegations |
| SF2 | Sage Screenshots - Rynette Control | Confirms Rynette's system control |

## Burden of Proof Assessment

| Standard | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| **Civil (50%)** | ✅ EXCEEDED - Peter's own letter admits suspected fraud |
| **Criminal (95%)** | ✅ STRENGTHENED - Director's admission of fraud awareness |

## Filing Relevance

This evidence is relevant to:
1. **CIPC Complaint** - Director's knowledge of fraud
2. **POPIA Complaint** - Data processing under fraudulent circumstances
3. **Commercial Crime Submission** - Director's admission of suspected fraud
4. **NPA Tax Fraud Report** - Exchange Control violations acknowledged
