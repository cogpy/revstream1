1.5 I have been involved personally, and continuously with the subject-matter of this application.

1.7 Any submissions of a legal nature are made on the advice of my legal representatives, which advice I have accepted as being true and correct, and upon which I act accordingly.

## PAGE 4

1.8 The contents of the documents to which reference is made herein must be read, with respect, as if specifically incorporated, and repeated herein.

### 2.

2.1

2.1.1 The first respondent is my wife, **JACQUELINE FAUCITT**, a major businesswoman with Identity Number 570607 0898 18 1, who is resident at 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview, Johannesburg.

2.1.2 The first respondent is a director of the third respondent, and a member of the fourth, fifth, and sixth respondents.

## PAGE 5

2.2.2 The second respondent is a director of the third respondent, and a member of the sixth respondent.

2.2.3 The second respondent is represented, and this application shall, accordingly, be served on his attorneys of record.

2.3 The third respondent is **REGIMA SKIN TREATMENTS CC**, a close corporation duly registered in terms of the Laws of the Republic of South Africa, with registration number 1992/005371/23, and registered address at 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview.

2.4 The fourth respondent is **REGIMA WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTION (PTY) LTD**, a for-profit company with limited liability, duly registered in terms of the Laws of the Republic of South Africa, with registration number 2011/005722/07, and with registered address at 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview.

2.5 The fifth respondent is **VILLA VIA ARCADIA NO 2 CC**, a close corporation duly registered in terms of the Laws of the Republic of South Africa, with registration number 1996/004451/23, and with registered address at 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview.

## PAGE 6

with registration number 2008/136496/23, and with registered address at 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview.

2.7 The second to sixth respondents are cited herein for the interest they have in this application; accordingly, no relief is sought against them save for costs, in the event that they may oppose this application.

### 3.

3.1 This Honourable Court has the necessary jurisdiction to adjudicate this application.

3.2 On 19 August 2025, I was constrained to make application ("***the main application***") to this Court, under this case number, on an urgent *ex parte* basis.

3.3 In order to avoid making this application unduly prolix, I refer to the contents of the main application — which is on Caselines, together with this application — as if specifically repeated and incorporated herein.

3.4 The Order of Court annexed hereto, marked "**AF1**", was issued by this Honourable Court accordingly.

Page 6/26 *[Handwritten initials]*


---

## PAGE 7

3.5 To date hereof, the main application remains pending; all that the first respondent has done is file a notice of intention to oppose (dated 5 September 2025).

3.6 Her attorneys (Edward Nathan Sonnenburgs) withdrew as her attorneys in the main application on or about 24 September 2025.

### 4.

4.1 Due to our personal relationships, a mediation was arranged between the first and second respondents and I (all represented by our attorneys), which was held on 18 September 2025.

4.2 The mediation was successful in that two written agreements resulted therefrom, copies of which are annexed hereto marked "**AF2**", and "**AF3**" respectively.

4.3 Annexure "**AF2**" is the mediated agreement dealing with the intended medical assessments of my wife, and son (the "***first agreement***"); annexure "**AF3**" is concerned with forensic investigations into the affairs of our various entities (the "***second agreement***").

4.4 As appears from the first agreement, my son agreed to submit to being screened for drugs, and my wife agreed to undergo a psychiatric eval-

Page 7/26 *[Handwritten initials]*


---

## PAGE 8

uation; both my wife, and son agreed to further assistance and evaluation, subject to views and requests of the relevant experts.

4.5 For the sake of fairness and transparency, I also agreed to being tested for drugs, and to undergo a psychiatric evaluation; I am proceeding with both.

4.6 It is important to note, with respect, that the aforesaid agreements were not reached in settlement of the entire matter between the first and second respondents, and I.

4.7 As appears from the first agreement, it was recorded that:

4.7.1 A number of disputes arose in relation to the order granted by this Court, and the relief sought in respect of PART B of the proceedings under the above case number; (Clause 1.1)

4.7.2 The parties have agreed to settle in good faith the disputes which exist between them on the basis set out below, which, subject to further agreement, does not finalise the aforesaid proceedings. (Clause 1.2)

4.8 As appears from the second agreement, it was recorded that:

Page 8/26 *[Handwritten initials]*


---

## PAGE 9

4.8.1 A number of disputes arose in relation to the order granted by this Court, and the relief sought in respect of PART B of the proceedings under the above case number. (Clause 1.1)

4.8.2 The parties agree to remain bound by the terms of the aforesaid order of Court until such a time as same is set aside or agreement is reached with regards to the finalisation of the aforesaid matter. (Clause 1.3)

4.8.3 Clause 26 provides that pending the mediation referred to in paragraph 2.5 above, the time periods for the filing of further papers in respect of the proceedings under case number 2025-137857 remain suspended, as the proceedings remain pending.

4.8.4 Clause 27 provides that insofar as the court order dated 19 August 2025 under case number 2025-137857 is concerned, the parties agree that paragraph 2.8.3 will be read as follows:

> *"... are interdicted and directed to answer all questions put to them in regard to the forensic investigation and the experts appointed by the forensic investigators, honestly and forthrightly."*

4.8.5 Clause 28 provides that this shall not preclude any party from approaching a Court for any appropriate or necessary relief.

Page 9/26 *[Handwritten initials]*

## PAGE 10

### 5.

5.1 On 22 September 2025, the respondents informed (annexure "**AF4**" hereto) their attorneys that they '*withdraw*' from both agreements; on 23 September 2025 they informed my attorneys thereof, as appears from same letter forwarded to them on that date.

5.2 The lack of coherence in that letter speaks, with respect, for itself; needless to say, with respect, I deny the allegations contained in that document, which are untrue.

5.3 The respondents' then attorneys (ENS Attorneys) then withdrew.

5.4 I have not accepted the attempted repudiation of the settlement agreements; the respondents are bound thereto, and they are held thereto.

5.5 Regrettably, I was again constrained to approach this Honourable Court, to have that agreement made an order of Court, which I did.

5.6 That application became opposed by the first and second respondent, and remains pending.

5.7 I refer, with respect, to the contents of the notice of motion and founding affidavit therein (which are also on Caselines, under this case number) as if specifically repeated and incorporated herein.

Page 10/26 *[Handwritten initials]*


---

## PAGE 11

5.8 The contents of both applications (being the main applicant and second/further application) are, with respect, essential to this matter.

### 6.

6.1 The first respondent's misconduct has now escalated to such a degree that I am again compelled to approach Court for urgent relief, as I now do.

6.2 At the end of September 2025, the first respondent, persisting in her misconduct, commenced harassing the fourth respondent's office personnel by repeatedly demanding her '*salary*', when none of us have drawn salaries (by agreement between us) for two to three years; we draw against our loan accounts with our various entities.

6.3 As appears from annexure "**AF5**" hereto (dated 30 September 2025), the first respondent emailed many of Regima's staff members, demanding the payment of her '*salary*'.

6.4 It is noteworthy, with respect, that included email with Regima's general attorneys, regarding pending litigation concerning Regima, which is not for the knowledge of its staff; this poses the disruption of Regima's business.

Page 11/26 *[Handwritten initials]*


---

## PAGE 12

6.5 It is also noteworthy, with respect, that she refers to Regima's funds as being '*her*' money.

6.6

6.6.1 On or about 29 and 30 September 2025 the first respondent — who is infuriated by the first order granted against her — then threatened me by saying that she was going to head to the fourth respondent's ("***Regima***") office, to '*tell all the employees what's going on within the company*', which will be enormously disruptive to its business.

6.6.2 I pause to mention, with respect, that the aforesaid occurred immediately after her '*withdrawal*' from the aforesaid settlement agreements, the first respondent placing all the '*blame*' on her erstwhile attorneys for her entering into those agreements, which is unfounded.

6.7 I, thereupon, advised the first respondent that she would not be welcome to attend at the Regima's offices, which she has in any event not done for *inter alia* years.

6.8 She then demanded that she *must* attend Regima's training session on its products, scheduled for 07 and 08 October 2025, needless to say,

Page 12/26 *[Handwritten initials]*


---

## PAGE 13

despite the underlying undertakings not to attend, she indeed did so – to the clear prejudice of the Regima staff and representatives.

6.9 The same day, 30 September 2025, the first respondent sent a further email (annexure "**AF6**" hereto) to Regima's staff (again including correspondence with Regima's attorneys) demanding that she must attend the scheduled training, against which I was very opposed, because I had no doubt whatsoever that she would have used the opportunity to be disruptive, she having said to me that she would cause a ruckus with the staff.

6.10 Also on 30 September 2025, I caused my attorneys of record to address urgent correspondence (annexure "**AF7**" hereto) to her, demanding that she desist.

### 7.

7.1 The first respondent then, also on 30 September 2025, responded in writing (annexure "**AF8**" hereto) undertaking not to attend the training, which she reconfirmed (annexure "**AF9**" hereto).

7.2 Although I expected that the first respondent would cease causing trouble, she has since or about 25 August 2025 *inter alia* demanded, that she be copied in on all Regima's correspondence.

Page 13/26 *[Handwritten initials]*


---

## PAGE 14

7.3 Unfortunately, Regima's staff complied with the first respondent's demand.

7.4 An exchange of correspondence (annexure "**AF10**" hereto) followed with Regima SA's accountants, De Novo, in which the first respondent participated.

7.5 Those emails pertained, *inter alia*, to the unknown transactions as well, to which the first respondent referred as if they were legitimate payments to certain suppliers, which they were not (insofar as no information has been provided with regards to them, and attacking Mrs Farrar, Regima's bookkeeper.

7.6 That correspondence (from the first respondent) is undoubtedly prejudicial, and contravenes paragraph 2.5 of the Order issued by this Court on 19 August 2025, which reads as follows:

> *"The First and Second respondents are interdicted and restrained from dealing with the business (and the administration thereof) of the Third to Sixth Respondents, and/or their employees, and/or their partners, and/or their clientèle, in any manner in which any may sustain any prejudice."*

7.7 On 1 October 2025, correspondence followed from the first respondent's attorneys in the main application (annexure "**AF11**" hereto), to

Page 14/26 *[Handwritten initials]*


---

## PAGE 15

which my attorneys responded on 2 October 2025, as appears from annexure "**AF12**" hereto.

7.8 Further correspondence followed from the first respondent to Regima's staff (the latest of which was on 10 October 2025), copies of which are annexed hereto marked collectively as "**AF13**", which is equally unconducive to the continuation of its business.

### 8.

8.1 Notwithstanding her undertaking not to attend Regima's training session (as aforesaid), the respondent in fact attended, as aforesaid.

8.2 Correspondence followed from my attorneys (annexure "**AF14**" hereto); the staff member to whom reference was made therein is Ms Gayane Williams; the content thereof speaks, with respect, for itself (Ms William's confirmatory affidavit shall be attached hereto as annexure "**AF15**").

8.3 After the training session, the two contract representatives mentioned in that correspondence contacted our offices, and asked if their jobs were still safe – which is confirmed by Ms Williams herein aforesaid.

8.4 I can only imagine what she said to them; I have no doubt that the aforesaid was massively detrimental to Regima's business.

Page 15/26 *[Handwritten initials]*


---

## PAGE 16

### 9.

### **AD ESCALATION**

9.1 The aforesaid contemptuous conduct occurred over approximately two weeks, and I had hoped that it would cease – respectfully, this continues to be my hope, however, it has unfortunately been confirmed by the first respondent's conduct, herein below, that this will not be the case.

9.2 From Wednesday 22 October 2025, the first respondent's conduct has escalated to a point where I can no longer sit back and attempt to '*put out*' the continuous '*fires*' the respondent creates with employees, suppliers, and other third parties.

9.3 The first respondent's conduct is not only contemptuous, and detrimental to Regima's business, but is also increasingly erratic, for instance, on 22 October 2025, the respondent called our bookkeeper (Mrs Rynette Farrar), and demanded that she send letters to confirm that we would not release Regima's stock to the United Kingdom branch, which was completely illogical since no payment has been received therefrom, although it was requested.

9.4 She also, on 22 October 2025, grabbed the telephone from Mr Arthur Mphande, who manages our storage and stock, whilst he was on the

Page 16/26 *[Handwritten initials]*


---

## PAGE 17

phone with Mrs Lynette Kruger, employed by Regima and who was checking stock levels of raw materials for manufacturing purposes, and forbade him from releasing stock from storage.

9.5 On 23 October 2025, she then removed the Regima phone from Arthur's possession, effectively ending all Regima's deliveries, and supplies.

9.6 Annexed hereto, marked "**AF17**", is a copy of Arthur's WhatsApp message to 'Linda' (Lynette Kruger). Her confirmatory affidavit is annexed hereto marked "**AF18**".

9.7 I also annex transcripts of the aforesaid calls of 22 October 2025 hereto marked collectively as "**AF19**".

9.8 I can only hope that our staff do not leave (citing constructive dismissals) before this Honourable Court intervenes again; undoubtedly, with respect, the first respondent will not stop harassing our staff, and suppliers.

### 10.

10.1 Since 22 October 2025, the first respondent launched what can only be described as a '*full out*' attack on Regima's staff:

Page 17/26 *[Handwritten initials]*


---

## PAGE 18

10.1.1 She emailed our bookkeeper, twice (per annexure "**AF20**" hereto) taking, insofar as I can ascertain, umbrage at her photograph in her email footer (as all our staff have in their email footers);

10.1.2 On 23 October 2025, she launched a barrage of complaints pertaining to Regima no longer dealing with Shopify, and sent emails in that regard, which I annex hereto marked "**AF21**"; notably, the parties to whom reference was therein made, were ordering from *inter alia* salons, per the contents of the emails themselves; Shopify was unrelated thereto; the orders were, however, sorted out by our staff;

10.1.3 She addressed further correspondence to Regima's staff, on or about 23 October 2025 (annexure "**AF22**" hereto), to addressees including unrelated employees, alleging (unfoundedly) the theft of (*inter alia*) pension funds (these allegations are so untrue and vexatious that I cannot even address them at all, save to deny same).

10.1.4 She then sent our staff emails (annexure "**AF23**" hereto) including makeup tips, which I can only deem harassment.

Page 18/26 *[Handwritten initials]*


---

## PAGE 19

10.1.5 Also on 23 October 2025, the first respondent called Mrs Farrar on her telephone, regarding the aforesaid. The transcript thereof is annexed hereto marked "**AF24**".

### 11.

11.1 The first respondent's conduct must, with respect, be halted.

11.2 As I have already indicated, it is only a matter of very little time before Regima's staff resign, to their significant detriment, and to Regima's significant detriment.

11.3 That will be, with respect, the end of Regima's business, to its detriment, my detriment, and to the detriment of the first and second respondents as well; we are all sustained by the businesses.

11.4 I seek, accordingly, *inter alia*, an order interdicting the first respondent from having any contact whatsoever with Regima, its staff, its suppliers, and its customers; the Order issued by this Honourable Court is specific regarding '*prejudicial*' conduct; while the first respondent's individual instances of misbehaviour are not always so glaring as to be considered prejudicial, the cumulative effect thereof certainly is.

Page 19/26 *[Handwritten initials]*


---

## PAGE 20

11.5 Regima's business, its employees, the first and second respondents, and I, stand to be prejudiced irreparably if an interdict is not granted as sought.

11.6 The respondent will not, with respect, desist unless an interdict is granted as sought in the notice of motion.

### 12.

### **AD SATISFACTION OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR AN INTERIM INTERDICT**

12.1 I say, with respect, that I have very well grounded reasons to believe that Regima, its employees, the first and second respondents, and I, will be prejudiced irreparably if an interdict is not granted as sought;

12.2 I have a *prima facie* right to the relief I seek;

12.3 The balance of convenience favours me overwhelmingly;

12.4 I have no adequate alternative remedy.

12.5 As appears from the notice of motion, I seek the relief set out therein pending the adjudication of PART B of the notice of motion in the main application.

Page 20/26 *[Handwritten initials]*


---

## PAGE 21

12.6

12.6.1 Although the first respondent's conduct is *contra* the Order made on 19 August 2025, and may justify an order finding her to be in contempt of the Order granted by this Honourable Court on 19 August 2025, it can be argued by the first respondent that her conduct is not *prejudicial*, as envisaged in the aforesaid Order of Court.

12.6.2 I believe, and say with respect that an interdict as sought — *that she may have no contact whatsoever with the third to sixth respondents, their employees, and/or their partners, and/or their clientèle* — is necessary to protect them, and her, and our son, and I.

### 13.

13.1 As I stated in the application I have lodged to have the aforesaid settlement agreements made an Order of Court, the first respondent has also become extremely inconsistent, and erratic in her 'management' of our entities, for example, after agreeing to business decisions, and signing agreements, she has thereafter stated her disagreement therewith, in no uncertain terms, and has taken exception to (according to her) the 'sudden opening of savings accounts' for our entities with ABSA Bank, which have been open for years.

Page 21/26 *[Handwritten initials]*


---

## PAGE 22

13.2 While I am not a medical practitioner, it is evident to me that something is now very wrong with my wife, to the extent that she is no longer capable of participating in the management of our entities, which must be protected from her.

13.3 There must, with respect, be an explanation for the deterioration in her behaviour. My only concerns are their well-being (my wife and my son), and the well-being of our entities, which sustain all of us.

13.4 Fortunately, I manage the day-to-day running of the affairs of the entities concerned, and I have seen thereto that my wife, and son, continue to receive their usual benefits as directors.

13.5 Similarly to our son, my wife cannot appreciate that I am acting in her best interests, and in the best interests of the entities that sustain us.

### 14.

### **AD URGENCY**

14.1 This Court has already found, with respect, for an Order interdicting the first respondent:

Page 22/26 *[Handwritten initials]*


---

## PAGE 23

> *"... from dealing with the business (and the administration thereof) of the Third to Sixth Respondents, and/or their employees, and/or their partners, and/or their clientèle, in any manner in which any may sustain any prejudice."*

14.2 The events after that Order was granted have only made the necessity of obtaining a further Order against the first respondent even more urgent.

14.3 If the first respondent is not stopped immediately, Regima's business, its employees, the first and second respondents, and I, stand to be prejudiced irreparably if an interdict is not granted as sought.

14.4 I say with respect that I have no prospects of obtaining substantial redress in due course if the further Order I seek is not now granted; the first respondent will certainly persist in her conduct, the inevitable imminent result of which will be that Regima's business will collapse, to its irreparable detriment, and to the irreparable detriment of my wife, son, and I – as well as our employees and their families that rely on their income.

14.5 The first respondent has, further, and on or about 29 October 2025, started to respond to emails regarding orders, with a rejection thereof on the grounds of 'fraud'.

Page 23/26 *[Handwritten initials]*


---

## PAGE 24

14.6 This is wholly unfounded, and is conduct that will bring the entities to a standstill if it is not immediately halted.

14.7 I attach hereto correspondence in this regard as annexure "**AF25**".

### 15.

Although, so far, it is only Regima that has been attacked by the first respondent it is inevitable, with respect, that the third to sixth respondents will suffer the same fate if the relief sought in the notice of motion is not granted.

### 16.

### **AD COSTS**

16.1 Costs are only sought in the event that this application is opposed.

16.2 It is, respectfully, launched in the interests of all the parties hereto.

### 17.

17.1 I further attach hereto confirmatory affidavits for the employees involved herein, that have not been dealt with herein aforesaid, namely;
