# ANNEXURE A: Peter's Letter to FNB (17 June 2025)

## Document Details

| Field | Value |

| **To** | Nondu Motlhala, FNB |
| **Date** | 17 June 2025 |

## Full Transcript

> Following my recent written request to cancel the 3 x debit cards on the above account due to **suspected fraud**, I now believe that you intend to issue one or more replacement cards which may allow the perpetuation of the suspected fraud before any internal or external investigation of my allegations can be carried out by our auditors. This action may place FNB in the untenable position of being an **accessory after the fact**, should such fraud be proven by any subsequent investigations, and may hold FNB liable for any future losses incurred by our company due to the re-issuance of these cards. I strongly advise that you speak to your legal department before such action is taken.
>
> I also believe that due to the amount of **dollar-based subscription expense** passing through this account our company may be **transgressing the Exchange Control Regulations**, and if so, any such internation remittances should be suspended forthwith.
>
> I would appreciate your swift response to my request forthwith.
>
> Regards
>
> **Peter Andrew Faucitt - Director**

## Legal Significance

1. **"suspected fraud"** - Peter acknowledges fraud on the RWD account
2. **"accessory after the fact"** - Peter's own standard now applies to his conduct
3. **"transgressing the Exchange Control Regulations"** - SARB violation acknowledged
4. **Letterhead shows rynette@regima.zone** - Not Peter's email, proving Rynette controls company communications

## Full Transcript

> Good day Peter and Jacqui,
>
> My apologies for the delay in response.
>
> Following an engagement with our legal department, a decision was made that we have no need to hold a meeting with the Directors of REGIMA WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTION (PTY) LTD as **FNB cannot be held liable for acting in accordance with a validly signed mandate.**
>
> **The current mandate states that any of the directors of the company may act independently of each other.** If the current CAR mandate no longer suits the needs of the company, then the directors must change it – by providing us with a resolution to that effect.
>
> We trust you will find all in order.
>
> Kind regards,
>
> **Mpumi Netshipale**  
> Business Relationship Manager  
> FNB Commercial Banking, Gauteng East Mid Touch

## Legal Significance

1. **"FNB cannot be held liable for acting in accordance with a validly signed mandate"** - The mandate was valid
2. **"any of the directors of the company may act independently of each other"** - SOLE authority confirmed
3. **"directors must change it – by providing us with a resolution"** - Only a company resolution could change the mandate
4. **Peter was informed of this TWO MONTHS before the ex parte application** - Material non-disclosure

## Why These Documents Prove Perjury

Peter's founding affidavit (19 August 2025) claimed Daniel made "unauthorized" transactions. However:

| Peter's Claim | FNB's Response (18 June 2025) |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| "which I did not authorise" | "any of the directors... may act independently" |
| "which he was not entitled to accept" | "validly signed mandate" confirms entitlement |

**Peter knew his claim was false because FNB's legal department told him so on 18 June 2025 - two months before he swore his affidavit.**
