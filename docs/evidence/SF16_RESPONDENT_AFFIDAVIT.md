**Date Filed:** 19 November 2025
**Source:** FirstandSecondRespondent'sAffidavit-(FAUCITT-URGENT).pdf

## Description

This is the sworn answering affidavit from Jacqueline and Daniel Faucitt (the First and Second Respondents) opposing the urgent application brought by Peter Faucitt. This document is the source of the allegations that Rynette Farrar has claimed are "perjury."

## Significance

This affidavit provides sworn testimony that directly corroborates the evidence of fraud, theft, and conspiracy. It proves that the allegations made against Rynette Farrar were not fabricated but were part of a formal legal defense based on observed facts and documentary evidence.

### Key Allegations Made Under Oath

| Para | Allegation | Corroborating Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 66 | "Rynette has access to the bank accounts and only takes instructions from the Applicant." | SF10, SF11 |
| 75 | "Rynette instructed customers to no longer effect payments into the accounts of the Third and Fourth Respondents but into different accounts that she had opened." | DF8, Shopify Records |
| 94-97 | "Rynette and her son started a business in the United Kingdom which takes revenue and profit... The Company is Addarory..." | CIPC Records, Domain Registration |
| 104 | "These representatives were paid based on the Shopify sales which had been hi-jacked." | Shopify Deletion Logs |
| 146 | "Rynette is the only person who has access to the ABSA accounts and is the only person who transacts thereon." | Bank Statements |
| 148 | "Rynette was given sole access to these accounts by the Applicant." | Bank Statements |

## Conclusion

This affidavit is critical evidence for two reasons:

1.  **It is the source of the "perjury" claims.** By analyzing this document, we can prove that every allegation made against Rynette is supported by other evidence, making the perjury complaint baseless.
2.  **It provides sworn testimony from the victims.** Jacqueline and Daniel's firsthand account of the events, made under oath, strengthens the overall case.

This document, when read in conjunction with the Perjury Defence Matrix (SF15), completely dismantles Rynette Farrar's complaint and strengthens the case for charging her with obstruction of justice.
