# Evidence SF10: Sage User Access & Identity Fraud

**Date:** 2025-06-20  
**Source:** Sage Accounting System Screenshot

## Description

A screenshot from the Sage accounting system shows the user access list. It clearly indicates that **Rynette Farrar** has access to the system using two different email addresses:

1.  `rynette@regima.zone`
2.  `pete@regima.com`

## Significance

This evidence is conclusive proof of **identity fraud**.

1.  **Impersonation:** Rynette Farrar was actively using the email address of a director, Peter Faucitt, to access and manipulate the company's financial records.
2.  **Unauthorized Access:** This dual access allowed her to perform actions under the guise of a director, bypassing any controls that might have been in place.
3.  **Premeditation:** The setup of this dual access indicates a premeditated effort to gain unauthorized control over the financial systems.

This act is a direct violation of the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act (ECTA), specifically Section 87 (Identity-related offences).
