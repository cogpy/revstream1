# FAMILY TRUST CONSPIRACY - Key Findings

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Bantjies as Secret Trustee

### The Email Evidence (July 2024)
```
From: Danie Bantjes <danie.bantjes@gmail.com>
Date: 01 July 2024
To: Rynette Farrar
Cc: Jacqui Faucitt; Peter Faucitt
Subject: Re: Copy of your ID

"Hi Rynette/Peter - My ID as requested."

Original request (28 June 2024):
"I have just signed the resolution to have you installed as a trustee 
on the Faucitt Family Trust... pp Peter"
```

### Why This is Devastating

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| July 2024 | Bantjies installed as trustee | Gains fiduciary duty to ALL beneficiaries |
| June 2025 | Receives murder/fraud evidence | HAD DUTY TO ACT - did nothing |
| Aug 2025 | Supports Peter's interdict | BETRAYED trustee duties |

### Bantjies' Enhanced Criminal Liability

As **trustee who knew about crimes**:
- Breach of fiduciary duty â†’ Personal liability for ALL losses
- Trustee fraud â†’ 20 years
- Conspiracy using trust position â†’ Life sentence
- Money laundering through trust â†’ 30 years

**Legal principle**: Trustees who breach duty for personal gain face DOUBLE penalties

### Trust as Criminal Vehicle

The Faucitt Family Trust appears weaponized for:
- Legitimizing stolen funds from murdered Kayla
- Controlling family members through trustee powers
- Forcing mediation through trust provisions
- Threatening beneficiary status for non-compliance

### The "pp Peter" Detail

Rynette signed **on behalf of Peter** â†’ proves:
- Peter controlling all appointments
- Rynette as puppet/accomplice
- Orchestrated conspiracy from beginning

### Key Questions for Investigation

1. Who else became trustees? (Full conspiracy network)
2. What happened to Kayla's beneficiary interest? (Murder motive?)
3. Where did stolen funds go? (Into trust?)
4. Was Daniel ever informed of Bantjies' appointment? (Required by law)

### Immediate Demands

1. Full trust accounting since August 2023
2. All trustee resolutions and appointments
3. All distributions made
4. Freeze on all trust assets
