# Evidence SF12: Rezonance Supplier Ledger Debt

**Date:** 2023-02-28
**Source:** Rezonance (Pty) Ltd Supplier Ledger

## Description

The supplier ledger for Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by the late Kayla Pretorius (Daniel Faucitt's partner), shows an outstanding balance of **R1,035,361.34** owed by RegimA Skin Treatments.

## Significance

This evidence is critical in establishing **motive** for the subsequent actions against Daniel Faucitt.

1.  **Motive:** The existence of this significant debt, owed to Daniel's deceased partner's company, provided a strong financial motive to neutralize Daniel and prevent him from claiming these funds on behalf of Kayla's estate.
2.  **Timing:** This debt existed just six months before Kayla's death and became a central point of contention.
3.  **Creditor Elimination:** The subsequent pressure to dissolve Rezonance and the legal action against Daniel can be seen as a strategy to eliminate this R1M+ creditor and absorb the funds into the entities controlled by Peter Faucitt and Rynette Farrar.

This debt forms a key part of the financial narrative and demonstrates the lengths to which the suspects would go to control all financial aspects of the business.
