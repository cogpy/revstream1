# Evidence SF14: Corrected R18.685M Debt Structure

**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Source:** Analysis of Faucitt Family Trust and Ketoni Investment Holdings documents

## Description

A re-examination of the financial documents has corrected a critical misunderstanding of the central financial motive. The R18.685M debt is structured as follows:

*   **Debtor:** Ketoni Investment Holdings (Pty) Ltd
*   **Creditor:** The Faucitt Family Trust

This is **not** a personal loan involving Danie Bantjies.

## Significance

This corrected understanding is **more damning** and reveals the true nature of the conspiracy.

1.  **Dual-Control Loop:** It places **Danie Bantjies** in control of both ends of the transaction. As a trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust (the creditor) and having insider access to Ketoni Investment Holdings (the debtor) through his professional relationship with its director, Kevin Derrick, Bantjies has a complete and irreconcilable conflict of interest.
2.  **Insider Trading & Self-Dealing:** This structure facilitates insider trading and self-dealing, as Bantjies can influence the transaction from both sides for his own benefit or the benefit of his co-conspirators.
3.  **Motive Clarified:** This clarifies the motive for neutralizing the other beneficiaries (Jacqueline and Daniel Faucitt). With them out of the way, Peter Faucitt and Danie Bantjies could control the distribution of the R18.685M payout.

This evidence is the cornerstone of the insider trading and self-dealing charges against Danie Bantjies.
