## Sales Process Flow

The document reveals a six-step sales process with clear paper trail documentation:

### Step 1: Order Receipt
Customer contacts via **Phone** or **Email**, with orders received by either **Kent** or **EL**.

### Step 2: Proforma Invoice Creation
Kent or EL creates a **Proforma Invoice** in **Shopify**, which is then emailed to the customer.

### Step 3: Payment Processing
Customer pays the Proforma Invoice and emails **Proof of Payment (POP)** to Kent or EL.

### Step 4: Order Fulfillment
Upon receiving POP, Kent or EL marks the order as **fulfilled** in Shopify.

### Step 5: Tax Invoice Generation (Automated)
Once the order is marked fulfilled in Shopify, the order **automatically pulls through to Sage**, where a **Tax Invoice is created automatically** and emailed to the customer.

### Step 6: Shipping & Delivery
The shipment is loaded on the **Courier Guy portal**, generating a tracking number. Courier Guy collects parcels, delivers (or notifies of problems), and provides final delivery success/return notification.

## Evidence Significance

### Legal Relevance by Application

| Application | Relevance | Key Points |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Companies Act** | Demonstrates operational structure | Personnel roles, system controls |
| **POPIA** | Shows customer data handling | Email, phone, delivery addresses |
| **Tax Fraud** | Documents tax invoice generation | Sage automation, paper trail |
| **Commercial Crime** | Establishes revenue flow | Proforma → POP → Tax Invoice |

### Key Findings

The organogram reveals several critical operational aspects:

1. **Dual Personnel Control**: Both Kent and EL handle all customer orders, creating potential for collusion or oversight gaps.

2. **Manual POP Verification**: The process requires manual receipt of Proof of Payment before order fulfillment, creating a control point.

3. **Automated Tax Invoice Generation**: The Shopify-to-Sage automation ensures tax invoices are generated once orders are fulfilled, creating a verifiable audit trail.

4. **Third-Party Verification**: Courier Guy provides independent tracking and delivery verification, offering external corroboration of order fulfillment.

5. **Clear Paper Trail**: The process creates a documented chain: Proforma Invoice → POP → Tax Invoice → Delivery Confirmation.
