Dear Sirs,

### URGENT – WITH PREJUDICE

**RE: PETER ANDREW FAUCITT / JACQUELINE FAUCITT & OTHERS**
**CASE NO: 2025-137857**

1. The above matter refers as does your correspondence dated 30 September 2025 and the response received from Jacqueline Faucitt ("Jacqui") in response thereto.

2. At the outset, we record the fact that we have been approached by Jacqui and Daniel James Faucitt ("our clients") to consider the potential anticipation and setting aside of the urgent *ex parte* order that was granted against them on 19 August 2025.

3. In this regard, the order obtained against our clients interdicts and restrains them, pending the determination of the relief sought under Part B of the notice of motion, from, *inter alia*, dealing with the business (and the administration thereof) of the Third to Sixth Respondents.

their employees, partners, and clientele, "*in any manner in which any may sustain any prejudice*".

4. Regima is a medically recognised and highly specialised range of skin treatments, developed more than 33 years ago by Jacqui, who remains the Chief Executive Officer and Head of Regima. She is, and remains, the lead trainer at Regima.

5. The Regima product range is widely used by plastic surgeons and other medical practitioners and has achieved international recognition for its effectiveness and safety. The use of the products however requires proper training and only those persons who are certified as competent may apply the Regima products due to the potential for serious bodily harm to be suffered as a result of the improper use and application of the products.

6. To this end, we have been instructed by our clients that prior to the obtaining of the interdict, a training course was scheduled for 7 to 8 October 2025 for therapists to be trained in using the Regima product range.

7. Given that our client, Jacqui, is the original designer of the treatments, the lead trainer, and the only individual with comprehensive knowledge of the products' methodology and application, her involvement in training is essential.

8. Furthermore, the training process is stringent. Therapists are required to pass both a written examination and a practical assessment. This is due to the potential for physical harm in the event of the improper use of the products.

9. The presence of our client at the upcoming training course is essential and will ensures that the attendees are properly instructed, trained, and supervised, and that they acquire the necessary confidence and skill to administer these treatments safely.

10. Notwithstanding the above, you and your client have taken the view that should our client attend to train these therapists, she will be in contempt of the order. This interpretation of the order is manifestly wrong.


---

## PAGE 3

Page 3

11. None of the paragraphs in the order prevent our client from attending to train the therapists and we are at a loss to understand how her conduct could result in the businesses, their employees, partners and clientele sustaining any form of prejudice.

12. To the extent that you disagree, you are specifically required to set out the prejudice which you contend may be suffered should our client attend to train the therapists during the course.

13. There cannot however be any conceivable prejudice and, in our view, our client's intended conduct does not constitute a breach of the order. The order cannot be interpreted to wholly exclude our clients from the business of the various Regima entities.

14. We accordingly afford you a period of until close of business on **Thursday, 2 October 2025** to substantiate your client's position which, for the reasons already advanced, is improper.

15. Apart from the above, we request that you urgently invite the following profiles to Court Online and CaseLines so that we can advise our clients:

15.1. Ian Levitt – ian@ianlevitt.co.za (Court Online and CaseLines); and

15.2. Natan Back – natan@ianlevitt.co.za (CaseLines).

16. We await your urgent response and reserve all of our clients' rights.

Yours faithfully,

**IAN LEVITT ATTORNEYS**

**PER: IAN LEVITT & NATAN BACK**

SENT ELECTRONICALLY AND THEREFORE UNSIGNED

Dear Sir / Madam,

**RE: PETER ANDREW FAUCITT // JACQUELINE FAUCITT & DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT & 7 OTHERS**

**CASE NO: 2025-137857**

The above-mentioned matter refers, as well as your correspondence received on 01 October 2025.

We advise that the content thereof has been noted, and confirm that any aspect thereof not admitted herein, should be deemed denied.

We further reserve our client's rights to address same in the appropriate forum or form, or in due course, as the need may arise.

In introduction, it would seem that your office has not been placed in complete instructions – we suggest that same be obtained prior to considering any anticipation application, or the like.

In this regard, we pause to note as follows:

1. Your clients' agreed to abide by the order, through their erstwhile attorneys of record;

2. Your clients' have undersigned two separate agreements, subsequent to our client obtaining an order;

3. The agreements reconfirm that your clients will abide by the order of Court, and further proceed to *inter alia* supplement the relief through agreement to drug testing and psychometric assessments;

4. Respectfully, not only have your clients' been well-aware of the order, they agreed not only to uphold the order, but to further same;

5. A reconsideration, in the circumstances, would be ill-advised;

6. We pause to note that our client, in compliance therewith, is proceeding with both – his psychometric assessment having started on even date;

7. Your clients, more specifically Mrs Faucitt, have already contravened the order – our client would be well within his rights to proceed with contempt of Court proceedings, but has, at present, refrained therefrom *inter alia* in the interests of the family bonds;

8. We will, herein below, delineate hereupon – it should be noted that this list is not **exhaustive**:

   a. Your client has contacted staff telephonically to warn them of impending changes in the entities, which may affect the staff's employment – which is prejudicial;

   b. Your client has emailed numerous staff with *inter alia* unnecessary and prejudicial statements:

Dear Marisca et al

It appears you may be being misled by the bookkeeper, Rynette Farrar, as she has nothing to do with Danny's company accounts. You are possibly submitting accounts that have not been checked by Danny, and for the record, as she is wrong, he is not being uncooperative as he has not been contacted in this regard.

Peter knows we have scheduled REGIMA SKIN TREATMENTS training next Monday and Tuesday. He knows I am expected to attend. If I miss then it is highly detrimental to the REGIMA company brand so what do you suggest I do, not attend. If you too are banning me from my building then I will comply.

12. The training was scheduled so that a company representative could provide the training (as is generally done), and not your client;

13. Your client has not partaken in each and every training session (and has in this regard happily allowed company representatives to present the training), and has not attended to the office regularly in any event since the present building was purchased – approximately 10 years ago;

14. To aver that there will be any issue with the training or products, should she not attend to the training, is unfounded;

15. We agree that the order does not specifically interdict your clients from attending at the business – however, it is clear from your clients present conduct (most specifically Mrs Faucitt) that any attendance to the business will likely result in prejudicial allegations and/or statements being made;

It is our client's considered view that your client's request to attend at the business is not made in good faith.

We reserve our client's rights herein in *toto*.

We further request that you serve a notice of appointment as attorneys of record herein, so as to confirm same.

I just spoke to Pete and told him you girls are having difficulty getting a response to the SA girls receiving your order.

He is aware that you are trying to get a response to confirm receipt.

**Rynette, please print out the e-mail to Pete so he is aware of the UK sending an order that is now urgent. As they have sent it 3 times with no response**

**Cc:** 'Jacqui Faucitt' <jax@regima.zone>; linda@regimaskin.co.za
**Subject:** Bank Statements / Unknown transfers

Good morning

Hope you all are keeping well.

I have sent through all the bank statements requested yesterday.

I have looked at the schedule of unknown transfers, and the only one that I can identify for sure is the transaction on the 13th of July 2022 for R25 000.00, as I saw correspondence with Barend from Dermal Skin. This total Barend has taken, so it would have been transferred to one of his private / business accounts.

The rest I do not know, and Barend say it is transfers that Danny has done, so Barend does not know either. Danny at this moment is not giving us any co-operation, so I cannot ask him. As far as I'm concerned, the amounts that were not paid directly to us at Regima Skin, were done to one of Barend's accounts. I seem to recall that the R25 000's, R50 000', R45 000's amounts all went to Barend accounts to cover his expenses as a distributor.

Also, these descriptions used for these transfers does not make sense at all. Like there is one transaction that refer to AOD, which is Barend customer account with Regima Skin, but I do not see that amount as being transferred into this account.

Sorry, I could not be of more help.

Regards
