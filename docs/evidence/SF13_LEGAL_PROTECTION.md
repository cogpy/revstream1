# Evidence SF13: Coordinated Legal Protection

**Date:** 2025-11-26
**Source:** Letter of Demand from Elliott Attorneys

## Description

A letter of demand was sent from **Elliott Attorneys**, representing Peter Faucitt, to **Pottas Attorneys**, who were representing **Rynette Farrar**. This communication occurred in the context of legal disputes following the interdict.

## Significance

This letter is direct evidence of a **coordinated conspiracy** between Peter Faucitt and Rynette Farrar.

1.  **Protection of a Non-Party:** Peter Faucitt, through his attorneys, was actively involved in the legal protection of Rynette Farrar, who was not a director, shareholder, or formal party to the main legal disputes. This shows a clear alliance.
2.  **Conspiracy:** This coordination between their legal teams indicates that they were working together to present a unified front and protect each other from the legal and financial consequences of their actions.
3.  **Shared Interests:** It demonstrates that their interests were aligned, and that Peter Faucitt was using his resources to protect a key co-conspirator.

This evidence refutes any claim that Rynette Farrar was merely an employee acting on instructions and establishes her as a central figure in the conspiracy.
