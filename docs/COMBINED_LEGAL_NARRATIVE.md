## 1. Executive Summary

This document integrates the Trust Capture Map and the Curatorship Setup Pattern Analysis into a single, coherent legal narrative. This narrative forms the foundation of the Rule 42 rescission application and the counter-application for delinquency and damages. It demonstrates that the ex parte interdict was not an isolated event, but a key step in a premeditated criminal conspiracy to seize control of the Faucitt Family Trust.

## 2. The Narrative: A Hostile Takeover in Seven Stages

**The story begins not in August 2025 with the interdict, but in July 2024 with the capture of the Trust.**

### **Stage 1: Trust Control (July 7, 2024)**

-   **The Act:** Rynette Farrar Bantjies, a bookkeeper, orchestrates the appointment of her associate, Bantjies, as a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust.
-   **The Motive:** Bantjies owes the Trust beneficiaries **R18,685,000**, due in May 2026. By controlling the Trust, he can control its assets and eliminate his debt.

### **Stage 2: Financial Sabotage & Data Destruction (April-May 2025)**

-   **The Act:** Rynette diverts company revenue to a secret bank account (April 14) and transfers the audit trail to a local server (May 22-23), effectively hijacking the revenue stream and destroying the data trail.
-   **The Purpose:** To create a financial crisis and manufacture a narrative of mismanagement.

### **Stage 3: The Whistleblower & The Retaliation (June 6-7, 2025)**

-   **The Act:** Daniel Faucitt reports suspected embezzlement to Bantjies (the perpetrator). The very next day, 15+ company credit cards are cancelled, wiping out 30 years of services and creating chaos.
-   **The Purpose:** To punish the whistleblower and accelerate the manufactured crisis.

### **Stage 4: The Cover-Up (June 25, 2025)**

-   **The Act:** Rynette instructs De Novo accountants to issue fabricated 2019 financial statements for "RegimA SA," a company that didn't exist under that name until 2021, with Peter Faucitt listed as a director two years before his actual appointment.
-   **The Purpose:** To create a false history and conceal the true financial state of the companies.

### **Stage 5: Business Isolation (August 13, 2025)**

-   **The Act:** Two days after Rynette sends Bantjies the "Main Trustee" letter, Bantjies signs a supporting affidavit for Peter's ex parte interdict. The interdict is granted, freezing Jacqueline's bank accounts, removing her as CEO, and banning her from the business.
-   **The Purpose:** To isolate the whistleblowers and prevent them from investigating the fraud.

### **Stage 6: Dependency & Delinquency (August-November 2025)**

-   **The Act:** Jacqueline is subjected to forced medical testing. Her reactions to the abuse are used as "evidence" of instability. A second and third interdict are filed to complete her isolation.
-   **The Purpose:** To create a false record of incapacity and justify a curatorship application.

### **Stage 7: The Endgame - Curatorship (Predicted Jan-Mar 2026)**

-   **The Act:** A High Court application will be filed to appoint a curator over Daniel and/or Jacqueline's estate, using the manufactured evidence of mismanagement, instability, and incapacity.
-   **The Purpose:** To seize control of the Trust assets, eliminate the R18.685M debt, and complete the hostile takeover before the May 2026 deadline.

## 3. The Legal Argument for Rescission

This narrative establishes multiple grounds for the rescission of the ex parte interdict under Rule 42:

### **Ground 1: Fraud on the Court**

-   The entire application was based on a fraudulent premise (mismanagement) designed to conceal a criminal conspiracy.
-   The applicants used fabricated evidence (2019 accounts) and material non-disclosures (Bantjies' conflict of interest) to mislead the Court.

### **Ground 2: Material Non-Disclosure**

-   **Bantjies' Conflict of Interest:** The applicants failed to disclose that their key supporting witness (Bantjies) was a Trustee who owed the beneficiaries R18.685M.
-   **The Curatorship Plan:** The applicants failed to disclose that the interdict was merely one step in a larger plan to seize control of the Trust through curatorship.
-   **The Financial Sabotage:** The applicants failed to disclose that the "crisis" they were seeking to prevent was one they had manufactured themselves through bank account diversion and card cancellation.

### **Ground 3: Abuse of Process**

-   The Court's processes were used for an ulterior purpose: to facilitate a hostile takeover, not to obtain legitimate relief.
-   The sequential interdicts, the forced medical testing, and the weaponization of the legal system constitute a gross abuse of process.

## 4. The Counter-Application

This narrative also establishes the grounds for a comprehensive counter-application:

1.  **Delinquency Declaration:** Against Bantjies and Rynette for their roles in the fraudulent scheme (Companies Act s 162).
2.  **Trustee Removal:** An application to have Bantjies removed as a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust.
3.  **Damages:** A civil claim for damages caused by the conspiracy, including financial losses and reputational harm.
4.  **Criminal Prosecution:** A request for the Court to refer the matter to the NPA for criminal prosecution under POCA.

## 5. Conclusion

By presenting this combined legal narrative, the defense can demonstrate that the ex parte interdict was not a legitimate legal action, but a criminal act. The Court was not a neutral arbiter; it was an unwitting instrument in a hostile takeover.

This narrative transforms the case from a defense against allegations of mismanagement into an prosecution of a criminal conspiracy. It is the key to not only rescinding the interdict, but holding the perpetrators accountable for their actions.
