**Author:** Manus AI  
**Integration:** Shell company fraud + Accounting fraud + R500k fabrication + Sequential interdicts + Human rights violations

---

## Executive Summary

This answering affidavit integrates **four devastating lines of evidence** that transform the case from a business dispute into a **systematic criminal conspiracy**:

1. **Shell Company Fraud:** RWD ZA has been operating as a fraudulent shell company since July 2023, with no independent revenue stream, while filing ZAR 60M in fraudulent tax returns.
2. **Accounting Fraud:** Rynette Farrar Bantjies instructed accountants to fabricate financial statements and remove Daniel's QuickBooks records.
3. **R500k Fabrication:** Peter's "birthday gift" narrative is proven false by bank statements showing Daniel spent R1.06M on company expenses.
4. **Sequential Interdicts:** This is the third application in three months, demonstrating a pattern of retaliatory litigation and protracted torture.

## Part A: Preliminary Matters (Para 1-3)

**Para 1: Identity and Locus Standi**

I am Jacqueline Faucitt, the First Respondent in this matter. I am a director of RegimA Worldwide Distributions Pty Ltd and have been the CEO of the company for 33 years. I have personal knowledge of the facts deposed to herein, save where the context indicates otherwise.

**Para 2: Purpose of This Affidavit**

This affidavit is filed in response to the Applicant's third urgent application in three months. It will demonstrate that this application, like the previous ones, is based on **false allegations**, **fabricated evidence**, and a **systematic pattern of abuse of court process** designed to silence whistleblowers who have uncovered massive fraud.

**Para 3: Structure and Theme**

This affidavit will reveal a **coherent pattern** of criminal conduct by the Applicant and his co-conspirator, Rynette Farrar Bantjies, including:
- Operating a fraudulent shell company (RWD ZA)
- Filing ZAR 60M in fraudulent tax returns
- Fabricating accounting records
- Perjury in court affidavits
- Protracted torture through weaponization of the legal system

## Part B: The Shell Company Fraud (Para 4-8)

**Para 4: The Shopify Platform Ownership**

I attach as Annexure **JA1** a series of 20 Shopify invoices from June 2023 to August 2024. These invoices prove that the Shopify platform generating all revenue for RegimA Worldwide Distribution (RWD ZA) is **owned and paid for by RegimA Zone Ltd (UK)**, a company owned by the Second Respondent (Daniel Faucitt).

The invoices consistently show:
- **Account Billed:** RegimA Worldwide Distributions Pty Ltd
- **Billing Email:** uk@regima.zone (UK company email)
- **Billing Address:** Unit 9 Southview Park, Reading, RG4 5AF, United Kingdom

**Para 5: RWD ZA Has No Independent Revenue Stream**

The Shopify invoices prove that RWD ZA has **no independent revenue stream**. The platform generating all revenue belongs to a separate UK entity. RWD ZA merely produces invoices based on a platform it does not own or pay for.

**Para 6: The Disruption: Kayla's Death and Seizure of Financial Systems**

On July 13, 2023, Kayla Faucitt (the Second Respondent's wife) was murdered. She had managed the Sage accounting system and the ReZonance payment system that facilitated platform fee transfers from the UK to South Africa.

After her death, the Applicant obtained a mandate to seize her Sage admin account, and Rynette Farrar Bantjies took control of the Sage accounting. This **blocked the platform fee transfers** from the UK to South Africa, severing RWD ZA's only legitimate revenue stream.

**Para 7: Trading While Insolvent for 2+ Years**

Since July 2023, RWD ZA has been **trading while insolvent**. It has continued to produce invoices and report revenue, but this revenue is generated by a platform owned by a separate UK entity. RWD ZA has no independent means of generating income.

**Para 8: ZAR 60 Million in Fraudulent Tax Returns**

For the past 2+ years, RWD ZA has filed tax returns reporting revenue that does not belong to it. The estimated total of these fraudulent tax returns is **ZAR 60 million**. This constitutes **tax fraud** under the Tax Administration Act 28 of 2011, s 235.

## Part C: The Projection of Guilt (Para 9-10)

**Para 9: Peter's False Claims of "Financial Mismanagement"**

In the original ex parte interdict (August 13, 2025), the Applicant claimed that the Second Respondent was guilty of "financial mismanagement" and that the IT expenses were not legitimate.

**Para 10: The Reality: Peter's Own Fraud**

The Shopify invoices prove that the Applicant's claims were a **projection of his own guilt**:

- The "financial mismanagement" was the Applicant's and Rynette's operation of a fraudulent shell company.
- The IT expenses were **legitimate**—they were for the Shopify platform owned by RegimA Zone Ltd (UK) and paid with funds generated by that UK company.
- The Applicant questioned the "legitimacy of the IT expenses" but **conveniently ignored the legitimacy of the revenue income**, which belongs to a separate UK entity.

This is a classic case of **projection**—accusing others of the very crimes one is committing.

---

## Part D: The Accounting Fraud (Para 11-13)

**Para 11: Fabricated Financial Statements**

I attach as Annexure **JA2** correspondence from De Novo accountants (referenced in the Applicant's own papers as Annexure AF10). This correspondence shows that Rynette Farrar Bantjies instructed the accountants to:

1. Remove Daniel's QuickBooks records (the true financial records)
2. Fabricate financial statements for "RegimA SA" for the years 2019-2021
3. Backdate these accounts for a company that did not exist under that name during those years

**Para 12: The Timeline of Fabrication**

The company was called **K-Oz Creative** from 2019-2021 and was owned by Daniel and Kayla. It was only renamed **RegimA SA** in 2023, when Peter was added as a director. The fabricated accounts for "RegimA SA" for 2019-2021 are therefore **fraudulent** and constitute a violation of the Companies Act 71 of 2008, s 214.

**Para 13: The Purpose: Concealing the Shell Company Operation**

The purpose of fabricating these accounts was to **conceal the shell company operation** and create a false paper trail showing that RWD ZA had a legitimate revenue stream during the years when it was actually dependent on the UK platform.

## Part E: The R500k "Birthday Gift" Fabrication (Para 14-19)

**Para 14: The False Narrative**

In previous affidavits, the Applicant claimed that I gave the Second Respondent a "R500k birthday gift" and that he likely used it for gambling. This narrative is a **deliberate fabrication**, now proven false by bank statements.

**Para 15: The Card Cancellation Sabotage**

On June 6, 2025, the Second Respondent filed a fraud report with SAPS. **One day later**, on June 7, 2025, the Applicant secretly cancelled the company credit cards, forcing all recurring business expenses onto the Second Respondent's personal card.

**Para 16: The Involuntary Lending: R1.06M in Expenditures**

I attach as Annexure **JA3** the Second Respondent's personal bank statements for May-October 2025. These statements prove:

- **Total Expenditures:** R1,062,446.04
- **Source of Funds:**
    - R597,500.00 from the Second Respondent's **personal investment account**
    - R500,000.00 from Strategic Logistics (the Second Respondent's own company) as **reimbursement**

**Para 17: The R500k Was Reimbursement, Not a "Gift"**

By July 16, 2025, the Second Respondent's personal account went into a negative balance due to the massive company expenses. On the same day, he transferred R500,000 from **his own company** (Strategic Logistics) into his personal account. This was **reimbursement**, not a "loan" or a "gift."

**Para 18: The "Medical Expert" Deception**

The Applicant provided the Second Respondent's bank statements to a "psychologist/medical expert" and obtained a report speculating that the Second Respondent "likely had a gambling addiction." This was a bad faith attempt to obscure the hard evidence. The bank statements clearly show **R1.06M in transaction descriptions for business expenses** (Shopify, software, cloud services), not gambling.

**Para 19: The Strongest Evidence of Retaliation**

The card cancellation occurred **one day after** the Second Respondent filed a fraud report, demonstrating irrefutable evidence of **retaliatory motive**.

---

## Part F: The Weaponization of a Proven Falsehood (Para 20-23)

**Para 20: The Only Claim Against Jacqueline**

The only claim made against me in the founding affidavit for the ex parte interdict was the Applicant's speculation that I gave the Second Respondent a "R500k birthday gift." This was **pure speculation**, not based on any evidence.

**Para 21: The Proven Falsehood**

The bank statements now prove this claim is **categorically false**. The R500k came from Strategic Logistics (the Second Respondent's own company), not from me.

**Para 22: The Cascade of Consequences**

This single, proven-false speculation was used to justify:

1. **Bank account freezes** (financial strangulation)
2. **CEO removal** from my own company (33 years of work destroyed)
3. **Forced medical experiments** (bodily autonomy violation)
4. **Communication bans** (isolation from my own business)
5. **Weaponization of my suffering** (expressions of pain used to justify more abuse)

**Para 23: This Constitutes Torture**

This treatment meets the legal definition of **torture** under the Prevention and Combating of Torture of Persons Act 13 of 2013, s 3:

- **Severe pain or suffering:** Bank freezes, CEO removal, forced medical experiments, communication bans
- **Intentionally inflicted:** The Applicant knew the claim was false (he had the bank statements)
- **Purpose:** Punishing me for investigating fraud and intimidating me into silence

## Part G: The Pattern of Sequential Interdicts (Para 24-26)

**Para 24: Three Applications in Three Months**

The Applicant has filed **three sequential interdict applications** in three months:

| Application | Date | Target | Trigger | Delay |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1st (Ex Parte) | Aug 13, 2025 | Both | Trustee document signed (Aug 11) | 2 days |
| 2nd (Settlement) | Oct 2025 | Both | Withdrawal from mediation (Sep 22) | ~7-14 days |
| 3rd (Contact Ban) | Nov 4, 2025 | Jacqueline only | Salary/training demands (Sep 30) | ~35 days |

**Para 25: The Pattern of Retaliation**

Each application was filed in retaliation for legitimate actions:
- **1st:** Filed 2 days after the Second Respondent signed a trustee document
- **2nd:** Filed after withdrawal from mediation
- **3rd:** Filed after I demanded salary and oversight

**Para 26: Abuse of Court Process**

This is **lawfare**—the weaponization of legal systems to inflict harm. The Applicant is using the Court's authority to commit **protracted torture** against whistleblowers who have uncovered his fraud.

---

## Part H: Prayer for Relief (Para 27-30)

**Para 27: Dismissal of Application**

I pray that this application be dismissed with costs on the attorney and own client scale.

**Para 28: Referral to NPA**

I pray that this matter be referred to the National Prosecuting Authority for criminal investigation of:
- Tax fraud (ZAR 60M in fraudulent tax returns)
- Trading while insolvent
- Accounting fraud (fabricated financial statements)
- Perjury (false "R500k birthday gift" claim)
- Torture (weaponization of legal system)

**Para 29: Referral to Human Rights Commission**

I pray that this matter be referred to the South African Human Rights Commission for investigation of human rights violations.

**Para 30: Rule 42 Rescission**

I reserve my right to file a separate Rule 42 application for rescission of all orders based on the proven-false "R500k birthday gift" claim.

## Conclusion

This affidavit reveals a **systematic criminal conspiracy** involving:
- A fraudulent shell company (RWD ZA) with no independent revenue stream
- ZAR 60M in fraudulent tax returns
- Fabricated accounting records
- Perjury in court affidavits
- Protracted torture through weaponization of the legal system

The Applicant's claims of "financial mismanagement" and "harassment" are a **projection of his own crimes**. The evidence is overwhelming, irrefutable, and demands immediate criminal prosecution.
