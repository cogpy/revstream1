# Ketoni ZAR 18.685M Payout Timeline & Bantjies' Conflicts

**CENTRAL FINANCIAL MOTIVE FOR CASE 2025-137857**  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-06

## Executive Summary

The central financial motive for the entire criminal enterprise has been corrected and is **more damning than previously understood**.

> **Ketoni Investment Holdings owes R18.685M to the Faucitt Family Trust**, not a personal debt involving Bantjies.

This places Trustee **Danie Bantjies** in a position of **controlling both ends of the transaction** through his connection to Ketoni's director (Kevin Derrick), creating **six distinct conflicts of interest** and enabling charges of **insider trading** and **self-dealing**. All events since April 2023 are strategic maneuvers to seize control of this impending payout.

**ALL EVENTS CONVERGE ON MAY 2026 PAYOUT DATE**

*   **Self-Dealing:** Bantjies is positioned to benefit himself by controlling both ends of the transaction.
