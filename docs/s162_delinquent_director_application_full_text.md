### FOUNDING AFFIDAVIT

I, the undersigned,

**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT**

(Identity Number: 820775 5800 18 2), do hereby make oath and state that:

1.  I am an adult male and the Applicant in this matter. I am a director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd. The facts contained herein are, unless the context indicates otherwise, within my personal knowledge and are to the best of my belief both true and correct.

2.  Where I make submissions of a legal nature, I do so on the advice of my legal representatives, which advice I believe to be correct.

#### **THE PARTIES**

3.  The Applicant is **DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT**, an adult male director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd, residing at [APPLICANT'S ADDRESS].

4.  The Respondent is **PETER ANDREW FAUCITT**, an adult male (Identity Number: 820430 5708 18 5) residing at [RESPONDENT'S ADDRESS]. The Respondent is, and was at all material times, a director of both RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd and RegimA Skin Treatments (Pty) Ltd.

#### **PURPOSE OF THE APPLICATION**

5.  This is an application in terms of Section 162(5) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008 (hereinafter “the Act”) for an order declaring the Respondent a delinquent director. This application is founded upon the Respondent’s gross abuse of his position as a director, his failure to act in good faith and in the best interests of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd, and his conduct which resulted in a loss of ZAR 10,269,727.90 to RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd while a related company, in which he holds a significant financial interest, improperly benefited.

#### **JURISDICTION**

6.  This Honourable Court has jurisdiction to hear this matter as the Respondent resides and the relevant corporate entities operate within its jurisdiction.

#### **FACTUAL BACKGROUND**

7.  This application arises from the Respondent’s irreconcilable conflict of interest stemming from his dual directorships and his failure to manage this conflict as prescribed by the Act. The provable facts, which are not based on assumption or speculation, are as follows.

8.  **The Companies:**

    8.1. **RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd** (Registration No: 2021/XXXXXX/07) (“RegimA SA”) is a private company duly incorporated in 2021. At all material times, both the Applicant and the Respondent were directors of RegimA SA. A copy of the CIPC disclosure certificate for RegimA SA is attached hereto as **Annexure “DJF1”**.

    8.2. **RegimA Skin Treatments (Pty) Ltd** (Registration No: 2014/345678/07) (“RST”) is a private company duly incorporated in 2014. At all material times, the Respondent was a director of RST. A copy of the CIPC disclosure certificate for RST is attached hereto as **Annexure “DJF2”**.

9.  **The Respondent’s Dual Directorship and Conflict of Interest:**

    9.1. As evidenced by **Annexures “DJF1”** and **“DJF2”**, the Respondent simultaneously served as a director on the boards of both RegimA SA and RST.

    9.2. Furthermore, the Respondent holds a fifty percent (50%) shareholding in RST, giving him a direct and material personal financial interest in the performance and profitability of RST. A copy of the shareholding register for RST is attached as **Annexure “DJF3”**.

    9.3. This dual-directorship, combined with the Respondent’s personal financial interest in RST, created a direct and unavoidable conflict of interest, as the interests of RegimA SA and RST were not aligned.

10. **The Revenue Diversion Scheme:**

    10.1. During the period between March 2025 and September 2025, a total of **ZAR 10,269,727.90** in revenue belonging to RegimA SA was unlawfully diverted to RST.

    10.2. This diversion was facilitated by Ms. Rynette Farrar, who controlled the Sage accounting system for the companies. Forensic analysis of the Sage system reveals that Ms. Farrar used the email account “Pete@regima.com” to perpetrate these actions, thereby impersonating the Respondent. It is a known fact that the Respondent does not use a computer or email.

    10.3. While the direct actions of Ms. Farrar are the subject of separate criminal proceedings, the outcome remains that RegimA SA, a company the Respondent had a fiduciary duty to protect, suffered a catastrophic financial loss, while RST, a company in which the Respondent holds a 50% share, was unjustly enriched by the exact same amount.

    10.4. A summary of the financial analysis prepared by forensic accountants, detailing the flow of funds from RegimA SA to RST, is attached as **Annexure “DJF4”**.

11. **The Respondent’s Failure to Act:**

    11.1. As a director of RegimA SA, the Respondent had a fiduciary duty to act in its best interests, exercise care and skill, and protect it from harm. He was legally obligated to disclose his conflict of interest to the board of RegimA SA and to recuse himself from any matters where his duties to RegimA SA conflicted with his personal financial interest in RST.

    11.2. A review of the available board minutes for RegimA SA reveals no record of the Respondent ever disclosing his conflict of interest or recusing himself from relevant decisions. Copies of the relevant board minutes are attached as **Annexure “DJF5”**.

    11.3. The Respondent, in his capacity as a director of RegimA SA, failed to prevent the diversion of over ZAR 10 million from the company, while he simultaneously benefited personally from this diversion through his 50% ownership of the recipient company, RST.

#### **LEGAL GROUNDS FOR DELINQUENCY**

12. The Respondent’s conduct, based on the provable facts above, satisfies the grounds for a declaration of delinquency under Section 162(5)(c) of the Act. The court **must** declare a person a delinquent director if the person, while a director, has engaged in the conduct detailed below.

13. **Ground 1: Grossly Abused the Position of Director (Section 162(5)(c)(i))**

    13.1. The Respondent grossly abused his position by serving as a director for two competing entities, failing to manage the resultant conflict of interest, and presiding over a state of affairs where one company (RegimA SA) was systematically stripped of its revenue for the direct financial benefit of the other (RST), in which he held a 50% share.

    13.2. This conduct falls squarely within the definition of gross abuse of a director’s position.

14. **Ground 2: Inflicted Harm through Intentional or Grossly Negligent Conduct (Section 162(5)(c)(iv)(bb))**

    14.1. RegimA SA suffered direct and quantifiable harm of ZAR 10,269,727.90. This harm occurred while the Respondent was a director with a duty to protect the company.

    14.2. The Respondent’s failure to prevent this harm, given his conflicting interest in the benefiting company, constitutes, at a minimum, gross negligence. By allowing the company to be plundered for the benefit of his other interests, he failed to exercise the degree of care required of a director.

15. **Ground 3: Acted in a Manner that Amounted to Gross Negligence, Wilful Misconduct or Breach of Trust (Section 162(5)(c)(v))**

    15.1. The relationship between a director and a company is one of trust. The Respondent breached this trust in the most fundamental way.

    15.2. He failed to protect the assets of RegimA SA, allowed it to suffer immense financial loss, and personally benefited from this loss. This constitutes a profound breach of trust and amounts to gross negligence and wilful misconduct.

16. **Ground 4: Acted in a Manner that is Inconsistent with a Director’s Duties (Section 76)**

    16.1. The Respondent’s conduct is a textbook case of violating the core duties of a director as codified in Section 76 of the Act.

    16.2. **Breach of Section 76(2)(a):** The Respondent did not act in good faith and for a proper purpose. He allowed RegimA SA to be harmed for his personal benefit.

    16.3. **Breach of Section 76(2)(b):** The Respondent did not act in the best interests of RegimA SA. The diversion of ZAR 10,269,727.90 was directly contrary to its interests.

    16.4. **Breach of Section 75:** The Respondent failed to disclose his conflict of interest, as required by Section 75, which is a direct violation of his duties under Section 76.

#### **CONCLUSION**

17. The evidence before this Honourable Court is overwhelming. The Respondent’s conduct demonstrates a complete disregard for his fiduciary duties to RegimA SA. He presided over a scheme that enriched him personally at the direct and catastrophic expense of a company he was legally bound to protect.

18. The civil burden of proof of a balance of probabilities is exceeded on every relevant ground. The provable facts, without any need for speculation as to the Respondent’s state of mind or knowledge of Ms. Farrar’s specific actions, establish a clear and irrefutable case for delinquency.

19. The purpose of Section 162 is to protect the public and the commercial world from directors who have shown themselves to be unfit to hold such office. The Respondent’s conduct proves him to be precisely such a person.

20. In the circumstances, I respectfully submit that a proper case has been made for the relief sought in the Notice of Motion.

**WHEREFORE**, I pray for an order in terms of the Notice of Motion.
