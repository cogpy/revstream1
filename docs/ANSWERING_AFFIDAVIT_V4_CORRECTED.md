## Executive Summary

This answering affidavit integrates three devastating lines of evidence, now updated with a corrected expenditure analysis that proves Daniel Faucitt spent over R1 million on his personal card due to the Applicant's sabotage:

1.  **Accounting Fraud:** Rynette Farrar Bantjies instructed accountants to fabricate financial statements.
2.  **R500k Fabrication (Corrected):** Peter Faucitt's "birthday gift" narrative is proven false by bank statements showing Daniel spent R1.06M on company expenses, funded by R597k from his own investment account and a R500k reimbursement from his own company.
3.  **Sequential Interdicts:** This is the third application in three months, demonstrating a pattern of retaliatory litigation.

## Part C: The R500k "Birthday Gift" Fabrication (Corrected) (Para 11-16)

**Para 11: The False Narrative**

In previous affidavits and correspondence, the Applicant has claimed that the Second Respondent (Daniel Faucitt) received a "R500k birthday gift" and likely used it for gambling. This narrative is a **deliberate fabrication**, now proven false by a comprehensive analysis of the Second Respondent's bank statements from May-October 2025.

**Para 12: The Card Cancellation Sabotage**

On June 6, 2025, the Second Respondent filed a fraud report with the South African Police Service (SAPS). **One day later**, on June 7, 2025, the Applicant secretly cancelled the company credit cards, forcing all recurring business expenses onto the Second Respondent's personal card.

**Para 13: The Involuntary Lending and Massive Financial Drain**

From June to October 2025, the Second Respondent's personal account was forced to pay for all of the company's operational expenses, totaling **R1,062,446.04**. I attach the Second Respondent's personal bank statements for May-October 2025 as Annexure **JA2**. These statements show:

- **Total Expenditures:** R1,062,446.04
- **Total Credits:** R1,085,403.00
- **Source of Credits:**
    - **R597,500.00** from the Second Respondent's **personal investment account**.
    - **R500,000.00** from Strategic Logistics (the Second Respondent's own company) as reimbursement.

This proves that the Second Respondent was **personally funding the company's operations** from his own savings, while the Applicant was simultaneously claiming he was receiving a "gift."

**Para 14: The R500k Reimbursement**

By July 16, 2025, the cumulative effect of these business expenses caused the Second Respondent's personal account to go into a negative balance. On the same day, he transferred R500,000 from **his own company** (Strategic Logistics) into his personal account. This was not a "loan" or a "gift." It was **reimbursement** for the massive deficit caused by the Applicant's sabotage.

**Para 15: The "Medical Expert" Deception**

The Applicant provided the Second Respondent's bank statements to a "psychologist/medical expert" and obtained a report speculating that the Second Respondent "likely had a gambling addiction." This was a bad faith attempt to obscure the hard evidence. The Applicant had the bank statements, which clearly show **R1.06M in transaction descriptions for business expenses** (Shopify, Airbrake, CircleCI, etc.), not gambling. The expert was given misleading terms of reference and was not shown the transaction descriptions. This demonstrates the Applicant's willingness to manipulate evidence and mislead the Court.

**Para 16: The Strongest Evidence of Retaliation**

The fact that the card cancellation occurred **one day after** the Second Respondent filed a fraud report is irrefutable evidence of **retaliatory motive**. The Applicant's actions were designed to inflict over R1 million in financial harm and disrupt operations in retaliation for whistleblowing.
