**Jax's Allegation:** Rynette instructed customers to divert payments to unauthorized accounts, depleting company funds.

**Refutation:** **FALSE DENIAL**

The evidence provides irrefutable proof that Rynette orchestrated a systematic payment diversion scheme:

- **Forensic Bank Records** show specific dates, amounts, and destination accounts for diverted payments
- **Bank Statement Screenshots** visually confirm payments from customers deposited into unauthorized accounts
- **Financial Analysis** quantifies the exact losses from the payment diversion scheme
- **Verification Matrix** cross-references specific customer payments to wrong accounts

**Conclusion:** Rynette's denial is a falsehood. Jax's allegation is proven true by the evidence.

### **Allegation 2: Unlawful Bank Account Control**

**Rynette's Denial:** "Denies controlling bank accounts unlawfully and taking instructions only from the applicant."

**Jax's Allegation:** Rynette unlawfully controlled company bank accounts.

**Refutation:** **FALSE DENIAL**

Evidence demonstrates Rynette's unilateral control over company financial systems:

- **Sage Account Screenshots** show Rynette's email as the sole contact for the primary financial system
- **Forensic Analysis** details the timeline and mechanisms of her assumption of unauthorized account control
- **Evidence Packages** provide screenshots showing Rynette as administrator and authorizer on financial platforms

**Conclusion:** Rynette's denial is a falsehood. Jax's allegation is proven true by the evidence.

### **Allegation 3: UK Business Revenue Diversion**

**Rynette's Denial:** "Denies that she and her son started a UK business that 'takes revenue and profit' from the respondent companies."

**Jax's Allegation:** Rynette and her son established a UK business to divert revenue and profit.

**Refutation:** **FALSE DENIAL**

The UK entity was central to the revenue hijacking scheme:

- **Section 3 Analysis** details the creation of **RegimA Zone Ltd** and its role in revenue diversion
- **Network Analysis** maps the flow of funds from South African companies directly to the UK entity
- **Executive Summary** confirms that the Shopify platform was owned and paid for by the UK entity, proving all revenue flowed through infrastructure controlled by Rynette's son, not RWD ZA

**Conclusion:** Rynette's denial is a falsehood. Jax's allegation is proven true by the evidence.

### **Allegation 4: Unlawful Competition via Addadory & regimaskin.co.za**

**Rynette's Denial:** "Denies competing unlawfully with the respondent companies through Addadory (Pty) Ltd and the domain regimaskin.co.za while employed as a bookkeeper."

**Jax's Allegation:** Rynette, through her son's company, competed unlawfully while employed.

**Refutation:** **FALSE DENIAL**

The competing entities were established and operated while Rynette had a fiduciary duty:

- **Timeline Evidence** confirms the domain `regimaskin.co.za` was registered by Addadory (Rynette's son's company) on 29 May 2025, shortly after a financial confrontation
- **Entity Analysis** provides complete documentation of Addadory (Pty) Ltd as a vehicle for unlawful competition
- **Contradiction Analysis** highlights the conflict of interest and breach of fiduciary duty

**Conclusion:** Rynette's denial is a falsehood. Jax's allegation is proven true by the evidence.

### **Allegation 5: Customer Redirection in Consort**

**Rynette's Denial:** "Denies redirecting customers to a company owned by her son and acting 'in consort' in pilfering business opportunities."

**Jax's Allegation:** Rynette acted in consort with her son to redirect customers.

**Refutation:** **FALSE DENIAL**

Evidence shows coordinated effort to move customers to entities controlled by Rynette's son:

- **Hypergraph Analysis** maps relationships and communication patterns showing coordinated customer redirection
- **Network Analysis** provides visual map of fund flows from redirected customers to new entities
- **Email Evidence** contains correspondence showing instructions to redirect customer orders

**Conclusion:** Rynette's denial is a falsehood. Jax's allegation is proven true by the evidence.

### **Allegation 6: False and Misleading Photos**

**Rynette's Denial:** "Denies that photos posted or circulated by her were false, misleading, detrimental to the RegimA brand, and created an unauthorized false affiliation."

**Jax's Allegation:** Rynette circulated false and misleading photos creating false affiliation.

**Refutation:** **FALSE DENIAL**

The circulated images were demonstrably misleading and intended to create false impressions:

- **Image Evidence** shows specific examples of misleading images used to create false affiliation
- **Harm Analysis** documents the specific harm caused to the RegimA brand
- **Image Index** catalogs the full set of false and misleading images circulated

**Conclusion:** Rynette's denial is a falsehood. Jax's allegation is proven true by the evidence.

### **Allegation 7: Stock/Raw Materials Risk**

**Rynette's Denial:** "Denies posing a risk of taking stock worth R5 million or using stock/raw materials for the UK entity."

**Jax's Allegation:** Rynette poses a significant risk to the company's stock worth R5 million.

**Refutation:** **FALSE DENIAL**

Given Rynette's established pattern of theft and misappropriation, her access to stock constitutes a clear and present risk:

- **Financial Analysis** independently values the stock at risk, confirming the R5 million figure
- **Risk Assessment** details the specific risks posed by Rynette's continued access to stock
- **Pattern of Conduct** demonstrates that an individual who has systematically stolen revenue and customers cannot be trusted with access to millions in physical stock

**Conclusion:** Rynette's denial is a falsehood. Jax's allegation is proven true by the evidence.
