## Key Issues

### Undeclared Income

The perpetrators failed to declare the income from the hijacked revenue stream, which constitutes tax evasion. The total amount of undeclared income is estimated to be in excess of **R10.27 million**.

**Evidence:**
- **[JF03: Financial Records](../../evidence/financial.md#jf03-financial-records-and-analysis):** The discrepancy between the actual revenue and the declared income will be detailed in the full report.
- **[JF07: Sage System Screenshots](../../evidence/critical.md#jf07-sage-system-screenshots-and-payment-records):** Shows the flow of funds and the diversion of revenue to undeclared accounts.

### Use of Shell Companies

The perpetrators used shell companies, such as RegimaSA (Pty) Ltd, to obscure the flow of funds and evade taxes. These companies had no legitimate business operations and were used solely for the purpose of financial manipulation.

**Evidence:**
- **[JF04: CIPC Records](../../evidence/critical.md#jf04-cipc-company-records):** Shows the corporate structure and the lack of legitimate business activity.
- **[JF03: Financial Records](../../evidence/financial.md#jf03-financial-records-and-analysis):** The financial statements of the shell companies show no revenue and minimal activity, which is inconsistent with their purported business purpose.
