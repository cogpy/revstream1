## Key Violations

### Breach of Fiduciary Duty

The directors of the involved companies, particularly Peter Andrew Faucitt, have flagrantly breached their fiduciary duties to act in the best interests of the company and its stakeholders. The evidence demonstrates a clear pattern of self-enrichment at the expense of the company.
