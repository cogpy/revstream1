## 1. Executive Summary

This document maps the systematic capture of the Faucitt Family Trust by Bantjies, orchestrated through a series of irregular appointments, conflicts of interest, and authority inversions. The Trust, which owns RegimA Worldwide Distribution and Villa Via Arcadia, became the central vehicle for the curatorship conspiracy.

## 2. Trustee Appointments & Irregularities

| Date | Event | Actor | Irregularity |
|---|---|---|---|
| **7 Jul 2024** | Bantjies appointed as Trustee | Rynette Farrar Bantjies | **A bookkeeper/administrator cannot appoint trustees.** This is a fundamental breach of trust law and indicates a pre-engineered control plan. |
| **11 Aug 2025** | "Main Trustee" letter signed by Jax, sent to Bantjies | Rynette Farrar Bantjies | **Two days before Bantjies signed the supporting affidavit for the interdict.** This proves the trust restructuring and the interdict were part of the same coordinated plan. |

## 3. Bantjies' Impermissible Conflicts of Interest

Bantjies holds three conflicting roles, creating an **impermissible conflict of interest** that breaches the fundamental fiduciary duty of loyalty:

1.  **Trustee:** Fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries (Dan & Jax).
2.  **Debtor:** Owes the Trust beneficiaries **R18,685,000** (due May 2026).
3.  **Accountant:** Professional duty to the companies, but taking instructions from Rynette/Bantjies.

**Legal Implications:**

-   **Breach of Trust Property Control Act, 57 of 1988:** A trustee cannot act in a way that benefits themselves at the expense of the beneficiaries.
-   **Material Non-Disclosure:** Bantjies signing a supporting affidavit for an interdict against the very people he owes R18.685M to, without disclosing this conflict, is a catastrophic non-disclosure in ex parte proceedings.

## 4. Authority Inversion: The Parallel Chain of Command

The evidence reveals a **parallel chain of command** where trustee-level actors (Bantjies, Rynette) bypassed the legitimate directors (Dan, Jax) to control the companies.

| Event | Evidence | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| **Rynette impersonating Peter via email** | Sage screenshots, email records | Decisions were not coming from Peter; his identity was being used as a proxy. |
| **Rynette following Bantjies' instructions** | Email records | Financial instructions originated from trustees, not directors. |
| **Rynette instructing De Novo accountants** | De Novo correspondence | Accountants were taking instructions from an administrator, not the directors. |
| **Rynette diverting payments to new bank account** | Bank account diversion emails (14 Apr 2025) | Revenue stream hijacked at the administrator level, bypassing directors. |
| **Rynette diverting audit trail to Pastel** | Audit trail disappears emails (22-23 May 2025) | Data control seized by administrator, bypassing directors. |

**Conclusion:** The entire corporate governance structure was inverted. The trustees were running the companies through a proxy administrator, rendering the directors powerless.

## 5. Embezzlement Warning Signals & Retaliation

| Date | Event | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| **6, 10 Jun 2025** | Dan reports suspected embezzlement to Bantjies | **Whistleblowing event.** Dan reported that expenses were being loaded onto RWD to push it into insolvency, while Villa Via was extracting funds at 86% profit. |
| **7 Jun 2025** | Peter cancels 15+ company cards | **1-day retaliation.** The card cancellations were a direct response to the embezzlement reports, designed to punish the whistleblower and create a financial crisis. |
| **13 Aug 2025** | 1st interdict application | **Isolation of whistleblowers.** The interdict was used to remove Dan and Jax from the business, preventing them from further investigating the embezzlement. |

**This is a classic whistleblower retaliation pattern:** report fraud → face immediate retaliation → get isolated and removed from the system.

## 6. The Trust as the Axis of the Problem

-   **Ownership:** The Trust owns the key assets (RWD, Villa Via).
-   **Control:** Trustees have ultimate control over the companies' financial investments.
-   **The Play:** By seizing control of the Trust, Bantjies could:
    1.  Neutralize the directors (Dan, Jax).
    2.  Restructure the companies.
    3.  Sell, move, or securitize assets.
    4.  Eliminate his R18.685M debt.

**The entire conspiracy revolves around capturing the Trust.** The interdicts, the fabricated accounts, the medical testing—it's all a means to an end: **total control of the Faucitt Family Trust.**
