## New Evidence (February 2026)

The following documents were added to the evidence base on 2026-02-05, significantly strengthening the case:

### 1. Shopify Centrality Organogram (11 Apr 2025)

**Document:** `Power point - how sales work.pdf`
**Created By:** Rynette Farrar for Peter Faucitt
**Significance:** **PREMEDITATION EVIDENCE**

This document proves that Peter Faucitt had full knowledge of Shopify's central role in the business **40 days before** the sabotage occurred. The organogram shows the complete sales flow:

1. Customer orders via Phone/Email → Kent/EL staff
2. Kent/EL → **Shopify** creates Proforma Invoice
3. Customer pays → POP sent to Kent/EL
4. Kent/EL receives POP → **Shopify** fulfills order
5. **Shopify** marked fulfilled → Automatically pulls to SAGE
6. SAGE creates Tax Invoice → Emails to Customer

### 2. Company Structure Disclosure (6 Jun 2025)

**Document:** `Fw_ update - Some Initial Information & Operating Entity Lists.pdf`
**From:** Daniel Faucitt to Accountant Bantjies
**Significance:** **WHISTLEBLOWING EVIDENCE**

Daniel's email provides a complete breakdown of:
- Company shareholding structure
- Director appointments
- Shopify store ownership (51 stores total)

**Key Finding:** RegimA SA has Daniel and Peter as directors, but **NOT Jacqui Faucitt**.

### 3. CIPC Record - RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd

> "The expenses for the Coral draw and Quickbooks do not belong to this company, so I suggest you open a loan account for one of Danny's other company's called Rezonance and post these expenses then to Rezonance's loan account."

**Daniel was NOT copied on these emails.**
