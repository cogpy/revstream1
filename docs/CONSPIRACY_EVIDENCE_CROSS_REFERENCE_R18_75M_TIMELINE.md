> "Just a friendly request please, not to send me any relevant information and comments privately. We all need to be working as a team..."

**Date:** June 10, 2025, 11:45
**Subject:** RE: The RegimA Group results and Computer Expense analysis

> "Fundamentally the issue is that Worldwide has found itself absorbing all costs of all companies when the cards all expired in Aug 2023 2 weeks after Kayla's murder."

> "The recent moves to take all of the payments directly into an account which only Rynette has access to and deny me any visibility while leaving all the expenses with me are not only bizarre but will ultimately prevent us from ever being able to resolve anything..."

> "In 2024 Rynette made the debt to Rezonance 'disappear' by misallocating international GoDaddy payments as though they were local payments made to Rezonance, yet Rezonance received no such payments..."

> "Bear in mind that Pete does not use the computer and has never seen the actual accounts for the company, nor has Jacqui and nor have I. They exist solely on Rynette's computer and nobody else is able to see them."
