## 1. Executive Summary

Peter Faucitt's claim that Daniel Faucitt received a "R500k birthday gift" and likely used it for gambling is a **proven falsehood**. Daniel's personal bank statements from June-July 2025 provide an irrefutable forensic timeline that proves the R500k transfer was **reimbursement for company expenses** that were involuntarily billed to Daniel's personal card after Peter secretly cancelled the company cards on June 7, 2025.

This evidence demonstrates **fraud, perjury, and a bad faith attempt to mislead the Court** by using a "medical expert" to speculate about gambling, while concealing the hard evidence of business expenses clearly visible on the bank statements.

## 2. The Forensic Timeline: From Sabotage to Reimbursement

![Forensic Timeline of Card Cancellation Sabotage](card_cancellation_timeline.png)

### 2.1. The Trigger: Fraud Report (June 6, 2025)

- On June 6, 2025, Daniel Faucitt filed a fraud report with the South African Police Service (SAPS) regarding financial misconduct within the companies.

### 2.2. The Retaliation: Secret Card Cancellation (June 7, 2025)

- **One day later**, on June 7, 2025, Peter Faucitt secretly cancelled the company credit cards that were used for all operational expenses (e.g., Shopify, software subscriptions, cloud services).
- This action immediately caused all recurring business expenses to default to the emergency backup card: **Daniel's personal credit card**.

### 2.3. The Consequence: Involuntary Lending (June 7 - July 16, 2025)

- For six weeks, Daniel's personal account was forced to pay for all of the company's operational expenses.
- The bank statements show a **50.3% decline** in his personal account balance between June 4 and July 4, despite receiving R100,000 in transfers.
- This proves that company expenses were greater than the funds being transferred in, and Daniel was **involuntarily lending money to the company** with every transaction.

### 2.4. The Crisis: Account Goes Negative (July 16, 2025)

- By July 16, 2025, the cumulative effect of these business expenses drained Daniel's personal account, causing it to go into a **negative balance**.

### 2.5. The Reimbursement: R500k Transfer (July 16, 2025)

- On the same day his account went negative, Daniel transferred R500,000 from **his own company** (K-Oz Creative / RegimA SA), of which he is the founding member, into his personal account.
- This was not a "loan" or a "gift." It was **reimbursement** for the six weeks of company expenses he had been forced to cover.

## 3. Debunking the False Narrative

### 3.1. The "Birthday Gift" Lie

| Peter's Claim | The Reality (Proven by Bank Statements) |
|---|---|
| It was a "R500k birthday gift." | It was a **reimbursement** from Daniel's own company. |
| The source was a gift. | The source was Daniel's own funds, transferred to cover company debt. |
| The purpose was personal. | The purpose was to prevent his personal account from defaulting due to company expenses. |

### 3.2. The "Gambling Addiction" Smear

| Peter's Claim | The Reality (Proven by Bank Statements) |
|---|---|
| Daniel likely had a "gambling addiction." | The bank statements show **clear transaction descriptions** for business expenses. |
| The expenses were suspicious. | The expenses were for **Shopify, software subscriptions (Airbrake, CircleCI), and cloud services (Cloudflare, Supabase)**. |
| A "medical expert" speculated about gambling. | The expert was given **misleading terms of reference** and did not see the transaction descriptions. |

This was a **bad faith attempt to obscure hard evidence**. Peter had the bank statements, knew the expenses were for business, and deliberately used a "medical expert" to create a false narrative.

## 4. Legal Implications

### 4.1. Fraud and Perjury

- Peter Faucitt knowingly made false statements under oath in multiple affidavits regarding the R500k transfer.
- He had access to the bank statements and knew the truth, yet he presented a fabricated narrative to the Court.

### 4.2. Abuse of Expert Evidence

- The use of a "medical expert" to speculate about gambling, while concealing the transaction descriptions that proved the expenses were for business, is a gross abuse of expert evidence.
- It demonstrates a clear intent to mislead the Court.

### 4.3. Strongest Evidence of Retaliatory Motive

- The fact that the card cancellation occurred **one day after** Daniel filed a fraud report is the most compelling evidence of **retaliatory motive (malice)**.
- This action was designed to inflict financial harm and disrupt operations in retaliation for whistleblowing.

## 5. Evidence to Deploy

1.  **Daniel's Personal Bank Statements (June-July 2025):** Highlight the account balance decline, the business expense descriptions, and the R500k transfer from his own company.
2.  **Card Cancellation Records:** Obtain bank records showing the cards were cancelled on June 7, 2025, and that Peter had the authority to do so.
3.  **Company Ownership Records (CIPC):** Prove that Daniel was the founding member of the company from which the R500k was transferred.
4.  **"Medical Expert" Report and Terms of Reference:** Show that the expert was not provided with the transaction descriptions and was asked to speculate.

## 6. Conclusion

The "R500k birthday gift" narrative is not a matter of dispute; it is a **demonstrably false statement** proven by the Applicant's own evidence. This fabrication, combined with the bad faith use of a medical expert and the clear timeline of retaliation, provides a powerful basis to:

- **Discredit Peter Faucitt's entire testimony.**
- **Prove a pattern of fraud, perjury, and abuse of process.**
- **Secure a punitive costs order** for the vexatious and malicious nature of the litigation.

This evidence should be central to the answering affidavit and the Rule 42 rescission application.
