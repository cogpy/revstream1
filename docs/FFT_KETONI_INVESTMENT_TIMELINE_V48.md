## CRITICAL TIMELINE PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: Ketoni Investment vs ReZonance Debt

```
Feb 20, 2023: Ketoni incorporated
Feb 28, 2023: R1,035,000+ owed to ReZonance (statement date)
Apr 24, 2023: FFT invests in Ketoni (5,000 shares)
Jul 13, 2023: Kayla murdered (ReZonance co-director)
Feb 14, 2024: Pressure to dissolve ReZonance
Dec 2025: Debt STILL unpaid
```

**Question:** Why invest in Ketoni while owing R1M+ to ReZonance?

### Pattern 2: Card Expiry & Expense Forcing

```
Jul 13, 2023: Kayla murdered
Jul 31, 2023: All cards expire EXCEPT RWD
Post-Jul 2023: Sage admin seized from Kayla's account
Result: All expenses forced to RWD (expense dumping ground)
```

**Question:** Why did only RWD card NOT expire?

### Pattern 3: Creditor Elimination Attempt

```
Feb 28, 2023: ReZonance owed R1,035,000+
Jul 13, 2023: Kayla murdered (50% owner of ReZonance)
Feb 14, 2024: Pressure to dissolve ReZonance
2024: Rynette misallocates GoDaddy payments to make debt "disappear"
Dec 2025: ReZonance under deregistration for non-compliance
```

**Question:** Is the pattern designed to eliminate the creditor claim?

### Pattern 4: May 2026 Payout Control

```
Apr 24, 2023: FFT invests in Ketoni
Jul 2024: Bantjies appointed as Trustee
Aug 2025: Interdict filed (9 months before payout)
May 2026: Expected Ketoni payout
```

**Question:** Is control consolidation designed to capture May 2026 payout?

## KEY INSIGHT

**Everything comes back to the Trust.**

The Faucitt Family Trust:
1. **Invested** in Ketoni (Apr 2023) while owing R1M+ to ReZonance
2. **Appointed** Bantjies as Trustee (Jul 2024) - the same person pressuring ReZonance dissolution
3. **Controls** the May 2026 Ketoni payout distribution
4. **Benefits** if ReZonance is dissolved (debt eliminated)

The interdict, medical testing, and control consolidation are mechanisms to ensure Peter controls both:
- Jax's 50% beneficiary share of the May 2026 Ketoni payout
- The R1,035,000+ that should go to Kayla's estate via ReZonance
