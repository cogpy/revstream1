## Key Findings

### 1. Danie Bantjies - The Missing Architect

**Significance:** Central fraud facilitator previously omitted from data models

**Roles:**
- Accountant controlling financial reporting with Rynette
- Unknown Trustee participating in trust violations with Peter
- Creditor with R18.75M (Ketoni debt to FFT) debt (motive to conceal fraud)

**Critical Action:**
- June 10, 2025: Dismissed audit request 4 days after Daniel exposed fraud
- Audit would have discovered R5.4M stock fraud and systematic manipulation
- Demonstrates consciousness of guilt and protection of fraud scheme

### 2. R5.4M Stock Adjustment Fraud

**Significance:** Largest single identifiable theft, sophisticated transfer pricing scheme

**Pattern:**
1. Stock valued at R5.4M disappeared from Strategic Logistics (trust-controlled)
2. Written off as "stock adjustment" without investigation (46% of sales, 10x normal)
3. Same stock type supplied by Adderory (Rynette's son) to RegimA
4. Systematic value extraction from trust to benefit Rynette's family

**Legal Impact:**
- Transfer pricing fraud
- Accounting fraud
- Breach of fiduciary duty
- Theft and fraud

**Support Network:**
- Rynette ↔ Linda (Sister/Employed Bookkeeper)
