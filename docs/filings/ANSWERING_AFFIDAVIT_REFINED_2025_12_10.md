## PART A: PRELIMINARY MATTERS

### Para 1: Identity and Capacity

I, JACQUELINE FAUCITT, am the First Respondent in this matter. I am an adult female, South African citizen, and the CEO and co-founder of RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd, a position I have held for 33 years. I am also a beneficiary of the Faucitt Family Trust. I make this affidavit in opposition to the Third Urgent Application filed by the Applicant on 4 November 2025, and in support of an application for the rescission of the original ex parte interdict granted on 13 August 2025 under Rule 42 of the Uniform Rules of Court.

### Para 2: Purpose and Structure

This affidavit serves three purposes:

1.  **Opposition to the Third Urgent Application:** To demonstrate that the relief sought is unjustified, based on fabricated evidence, and part of a pattern of abuse of process.
2.  **Rule 42 Rescission:** To establish grounds for the rescission of the original ex parte interdict on the basis of fraud, material non-disclosure, and abuse of process.
3.  **Exposure of a Criminal Conspiracy:** To reveal that all three interdict applications are not isolated legal disputes, but coordinated steps in a curatorship conspiracy orchestrated by Bantjies to seize control of the Faucitt Family Trust and eliminate his R18.75M (Ketoni debt to FFT) debt.

This affidavit is structured in eight parts (A-H), each addressing a distinct legal theory or aspect of the conspiracy.

### Para 3: The Pattern is Textbook

Before addressing the specific allegations, I must state a critical fact: the pattern of actions taken against me and my son, Daniel Faucitt, is not random. It is a **textbook three-stage curatorship setup**, as confirmed by independent legal expertise in South African trust litigation and fiduciary abuse cases. The three stages are:

1.  **Business Isolation:** Remove the target from systems, emails, authority, and finances.
2.  **Dependency Creation + Delinquency Allegations:** Portray the target as erratic, irresponsible, and financially irregular.
3.  **Medical Testing → Psychiatric Report → Curatorship:** Obtain a medical justification for removing the target's legal capacity.

Every action taken by the Applicant and his associates aligns with this pattern, point by point. This is not paranoia; it is the identification of a known legal pattern of abuse. I will demonstrate this alignment throughout this affidavit.

---

## PART B: THE CURATORSHIP CONSPIRACY - THE SEVEN-STAGE PLAN

### Para 4: The Mastermind and the Motive

The true orchestrator of this conspiracy is not the Applicant, but **Ketoni owes R18.75M to FFT (Bantjies has conflict as George Group CFO)**, due in May 2026, as part of a call option agreement with total exposure of **R70,580,000** over three years. This debt is the driving force behind the entire conspiracy.

By seizing control of the Trust through curatorship, Bantjies can:
- Eliminate his R18.75M (Ketoni debt to FFT) debt by "forgiving" it as the curator or through a proxy.
- Transfer Trust assets (RegimA Worldwide Distribution, Villa Via Arcadia) to himself in a sham settlement.
- Liquidate the companies and acquire the assets at a fraction of their value.

**Annexure JF_BANTJIES_DEBT:** Call option agreement showing payment schedule.

### Para 5: The Seven-Stage Plan

The conspiracy unfolds in seven coordinated stages:

| Stage | Date | Action | Purpose | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Trust Control** | 7 Jul 2024 | Rynette appoints Bantjies as Trustee | Gain legal control of Trust assets | JF_TRUSTEE_APPOINTMENT |
| **2. Financial Sabotage** | 14 Apr 2025 | Rynette diverts payments to new account | Revenue stream hijacking | JF_BANK_DIVERSION |
| **2b. Data Destruction** | 22-23 May 2025 | Audit trail disappears, 15 cards cancelled | Systematic cover-up, 30 years services wiped | JF_AUDIT_TRAIL |
| **3. Cover-Up** | 25 Jun 2025 | Fabricated 2019 accounts issued | Create false narrative, conceal fraud | JF_FAKE_ACCOUNTS |
| **4. Business Isolation** | 13 Aug 2025 | 1st interdict + bank freezes + CEO removal | Isolate whistleblowers from business | JF_INTERDICT_1 |
| **5. Dependency** | Aug-Oct 2025 | Forced medical testing, financial control | Create dependency, medical evidence | JF_MEDICAL |
| **6. Delinquency** | 4 Nov 2025 | 3rd interdict (contact ban) | Complete isolation, prove "incapacity" | JF_INTERDICT_3 |
| **7. Curatorship** | Jan-Mar 2026 (predicted) | High Court application | Seize assets, eliminate R18.75M (Ketoni debt to FFT) debt | All of the above |

This is not speculation. This is a **known legal pattern** in South African trust litigation, and our facts align with it perfectly.

### Para 6: The Authority Inversion

The conspiracy operates through a **parallel chain of command** that bypasses the legitimate directors:

-   **Rynette Farrar Bantjies**, a bookkeeper, impersonates the Applicant via email and takes instructions from Bantjies.
-   She instructs De Novo accountants to fabricate financial statements.
-   She diverts company revenue to accounts only she can access.
-   She seizes control of the Sage accounting system after Kayla Pretorius' death.
-   She cancels 15+ company credit cards, wiping out 30 years of services.

**The Applicant does not use a computer.** All emails purportedly from him are sent by Rynette. The entire corporate governance structure has been inverted, with trustees running the companies through a proxy administrator.

**Annexure JF_SAGE_CONTROL:** Screenshots showing Rynette's control of Sage.  
**Annexure JF_EMAIL_IMPERSONATION:** Evidence of Rynette impersonating the Applicant.

---

## PART C: MATERIAL NON-DISCLOSURE - THEORY 001

### Para 7: The Ex Parte Abuse

The original ex parte interdict was obtained through systematic material non-disclosure. The Applicant failed to disclose:

1.  **Bantjies' Conflict of Interest:** That his key supporting witness (Bantjies) was a Trustee who owed the beneficiaries R18.75M (Ketoni debt to FFT).
2.  **The Curatorship Plan:** That the interdict was merely one step in a larger plan to seize control of the Trust through curatorship.
3.  **The Financial Sabotage:** That the "crisis" he was seeking to prevent was one he and his associates had manufactured themselves through bank account diversion (April 14) and card cancellation (June 7).
4.  **The Fabricated Accounts:** That the 2019 financial statements he relied on were fraudulent, created in June 2025 for a company that didn't exist under that name until 2021.
5.  **The Shopify Platform Ownership:** That the revenue stream of RegimA Worldwide Distribution was owned and paid for by Daniel Faucitt's UK company, not by the SA company.

Each of these non-disclosures, individually, would be sufficient to justify rescission under *Schlesinger v Schlesinger*. Collectively, they demonstrate a deliberate fraud on the Court.

**Annexure JF_SCHLESINGER_SCHEDULE:** Detailed schedule of all material non-disclosures.

---

## PART D: RETALIATORY MOTIVE - THEORY 002

### Para 8: The Temporal Proximity Evidence

The conspiracy is characterized by a pattern of **immediate retaliation** against whistleblowing and oversight activities. The temporal proximity between trigger events and retaliatory actions is so close (1-7 days) that it proves malice and ulterior motive beyond any doubt.

| Trigger Event | Date | Retaliatory Action | Date | Days | Inference |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dan files fraud report with SAPS | 6 Jun 2025 | Peter cancels 15+ company cards | 7 Jun 2025 | **1** | Immediate retaliation against whistleblower |
| Dan signs trustee document | 11 Aug 2025 | Bantjies signs supporting affidavit | 13 Aug 2025 | **2** | Coordinated interdict launch |
| Mediation agreement fails | 22 Sep 2025 | 2nd interdict filed | ~29 Sep 2025 | **7** | Retaliation against settlement failure |
| Jax demands salary/training | 30 Sep 2025 | 3rd interdict filed | 4 Nov 2025 | **35** | Retaliation against legitimate oversight |

The 1-day and 2-day retaliation sequences are particularly damning. They prove that the Applicant and his associates were not reacting to a pattern of misconduct, but to specific acts of whistleblowing and oversight.

**Annexure JF_TEMPORAL_PROXIMITY:** Detailed timeline with supporting evidence for each event.

## PART E: THE FABRICATED ACCOUNTS - PROOF OF FRAUD

### Para 9: The 2019 Accounts That Cannot Exist

On 25 June 2025, De Novo Business Services issued financial statements for "RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd" for the year 2019. These accounts are **impossible** and prove systematic fraud.

**According to CIPC records:**
- Company name in 2019: **"K OZ CREATIVE"** (not "RegimA SA")
- Directors in 2019: D.J. Faucitt, Kayla Pretorius (not P.A. Faucitt)
- Name change date: **9 March 2021** (2 years after 2019)
- Peter added as director: **9 March 2021** (2 years after 2019)

**According to the fabricated accounts:**
- Company name in 2019: **"RegimA SA"** ❌ FALSE
- Directors in 2019: D.J. Faucitt, **P.A. Faucitt** ❌ FALSE
- Issued: **25 June 2025** (6 years backdated)
- Approved by: **P.A. Faucitt** (claiming to be a director 2 years before his actual appointment)

This is not an accounting error. This is **systematic, premeditated fraud** under Companies Act s 214 (10 years imprisonment).

**Annexure JF_FAKE_ACCOUNTS:** Fabricated 2019 financial statements.  
**Annexure JF_CIPC_RECORDS:** Official CIPC records proving the fraud.  
**Annexure JF_FRAUD_COMPARISON:** Side-by-side comparison diagram.

### Para 10: The R500k "Birthday Gift" Lie

The Applicant claims that Daniel Faucitt received a R500,000 "birthday gift" from me, and speculates (through a psychologist) that Daniel has a gambling addiction. Both claims are **proven false** by the Applicant's own evidence.

**The bank statements show:**
- On 7 June 2025, the Applicant cancelled 15+ company credit cards (1 day after Daniel filed a fraud report).
- This caused 300+ company expenses to bill Daniel's personal card involuntarily.
- Over the next 6 weeks, Daniel's account declined by 50% despite receiving R100,000 in transfers from his investment account.
- On 16 July 2025, the account went negative.
- Daniel transferred R500,000 from his own company (Strategic Logistics) to cover the company expenses.

**Total expenditures (May-October 2025):** **R1,062,446.04**  
**Funded by Daniel's personal investment account:** R597,500.00  
**Funded by Strategic Logistics (reimbursement):** R500,000.00

**The R500k was not a "birthday gift." It was reimbursement for company expenses that the Applicant forced onto Daniel's personal card through card cancellation sabotage.**

**The transaction descriptions on the bank statements show business expenses (Shopify, suppliers, services), not gambling. The psychologist's speculation is based on manipulated evidence and bad faith.**

**Annexure JF_BANK_STATEMENTS:** Daniel's personal bank statements (May-October 2025).  
**Annexure JF_EXPENDITURE_ANALYSIS:** Detailed breakdown of R1.06M in expenditures.  
**Annexure JF_CARD_CANCELLATION:** Evidence of 300+ defaulting bills.

## PART F: THE SHELL COMPANY FRAUD

### Para 11: RegimA Worldwide Distribution Has No Independent Revenue Stream

The Shopify invoices prove that the e-commerce platform generating revenue for RegimA Worldwide Distribution (RWD ZA) is **owned and paid for by RegimA Zone Ltd (UK)**, Daniel Faucitt's UK company, not by RWD ZA.

**Before Kayla's death (13 July 2023):**
- Kayla managed the ReZonance payment system that transferred platform fees from UK to ZA.
- RWD ZA had a legitimate revenue stream.

**After Kayla's death:**
- The Applicant seized Kayla's Sage admin account.
- Rynette took control of Sage accounting.
- Platform fee transfers UK → ZA were **blocked**.
- RWD ZA has had **no independent revenue stream** since July 2023.
- RWD ZA has been trading **insolvent for 2+ years**.
- **ZAR 60M in fraudulent tax returns** have been filed.

**The Applicant questioned the legitimacy of IT expenses but failed to question the legitimacy of the revenue income. The revenue does not belong to RWD ZA—it belongs to RegimA Zone Ltd (UK).**

**Annexure JF_SHOPIFY_INVOICES:** 20 Shopify invoices showing UK ownership.  
**Annexure JF_SHELL_COMPANY_ANALYSIS:** Detailed analysis of the shell company fraud.

## PART G: THE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS

### Para 12: Torture Through Weaponization of the Legal System

The actions taken against me constitute **torture** under the Prevention and Combating of Torture of Persons Act 13 of 2013, s 3.

| Element | Evidence |
|---|---|
| **Severe pain or suffering** | Bank freezes, CEO removal, forced medical experiments, communication bans, 33 years of work destroyed |
| **Intentional infliction** | Sequential interdicts, coordinated retaliation, manufactured crisis |
| **Specific purpose** | Punish whistleblowing, coerce silence, intimidate, obtain information, discriminate |
| **By or with acquiescence of public official** | Court orders obtained through fraud, used as instruments of torture |

**The cycle of abuse:**
1. I react to the abuse (express suffering, attempt to regain access).
2. My reactions are used as "evidence" of mental illness.
3. This "evidence" is used to justify more restrictions.
4. The cycle repeats, creating **protracted torture**.

**This is not a business dispute. This is a crime against humanity.**

**Annexure JF_TORTURE_ANALYSIS:** Detailed analysis of torture elements.  
**Annexure JF_CAUSAL_CHAIN:** Diagram showing the cycle of abuse.

## PART H: CONCLUSION & PRAYER FOR RELIEF

### Para 13: The Pattern is Textbook, The Evidence is Overwhelming

I have demonstrated that:

1. The three interdict applications are part of a **textbook curatorship conspiracy** to seize control of the Faucitt Family Trust.
2. The conspiracy is driven by Bantjies' **R18.75M (Ketoni debt to FFT) debt** due in May 2026.
3. The original ex parte interdict was obtained through **systematic material non-disclosure and fraud**.
4. The Applicant's claims are based on **fabricated evidence** (2019 accounts, R500k "birthday gift").
5. RegimA Worldwide Distribution is a **shell company** with no independent revenue stream.
6. The actions taken against me constitute **torture** under South African law.

The evidence is overwhelming, documented, and irrefutable. The Court was misled. Justice demands rescission, damages, and criminal prosecution.

### Para 14: Prayer for Relief

I respectfully pray that this Honourable Court:

1. **Dismiss the Third Urgent Application** with costs on a punitive scale.
2. **Rescind the original ex parte interdict** granted on 13 August 2025 under Rule 42.
3. **Declare the Applicant and Bantjies delinquent** under Companies Act s 162.
4. **Remove Bantjies as a Trustee** of the Faucitt Family Trust.
5. **Award damages** for financial losses, reputational harm, and emotional distress.
6. **Refer the matter to the NPA** for criminal prosecution under POCA, Companies Act s 214, and the Prevention and Combating of Torture of Persons Act.
7. **Grant such further and/or alternative relief** as this Honourable Court deems fit.
