# ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT V6: Exposing the Curatorship Conspiracy

**For:** 3rd Urgent Interdict Application (November 4, 2025)  
**Deponent:** Jacqueline Faucitt  
**Date:** 2025-11-18  
**Classification:** URGENT - CURATORSHIP CONSPIRACY EXPOSED

---

## STRUCTURE OVERVIEW

This answering affidavit exposes a **criminal conspiracy orchestrated by Bantjies** to seize control of the Faucitt Family Trust assets through a manufactured curatorship application. The three sequential interdicts are not independent disputes—they are **coordinated steps in a hostile takeover plan** designed to meet the legal requirements for declaring Daniel Faucitt incapable of managing his affairs.

---

## PART A: PRELIMINARY MATTERS (Para 1-5)

### Para 1: Identity and Capacity

I, **Jacqueline Faucitt**, am an adult female residing at [address]. I am the First Respondent in this matter and a beneficiary of the Faucitt Family Trust. I make this affidavit in my personal capacity and on behalf of the Second Respondent, Daniel Faucitt, my son.

### Para 2: Purpose of This Affidavit

The purpose of this affidavit is to expose a **criminal conspiracy** orchestrated by **Bantjies** (the Applicant's father and a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust) to seize control of the Trust assets and eliminate his **ZAR 18.685 million debt** to the Applicant and myself.

This is not a business dispute. This is a **hostile takeover disguised as litigation**.

### Para 3: The Curatorship Conspiracy

The Applicant's three sequential interdict applications (August 13, October 2025, and November 4, 2025) are not independent legal proceedings. They are **coordinated steps in a seven-stage plan** to manufacture the legal grounds for a curatorship application under the Mental Health Act 17 of 2002.

The plan is as follows:

1.  **Trust Control** (July 2024): Bantjies appointed as Trustee.
2.  **Financial Sabotage** (June 2025): Push RegimA Worldwide Distribution into insolvency.
3.  **Cover-Up** (June 2025): Fabricate financial statements to conceal fraud.
4.  **Business Isolation** (August-November 2025): Sequential interdicts to isolate Daniel and myself from the business.
5.  **Dependency** (August-October 2025): Forced medical testing to create medical evidence of incapacity.
6.  **Delinquency** (November 2025): Complete communication ban to prove "incapacity."
7.  **Curatorship** (Planned 2026): High Court application to appoint Bantjies (or a proxy) as curator, seize Trust assets, and eliminate the ZAR 18.685M debt.

### Para 4: The Financial Motive

Bantjies owes the Applicant and myself **R18,685,000.00**, due in **May 2026** under a call option agreement. This is the first of three annual payments totaling **R70,580,000** (R18.685M in May 2026, R23.165M in May 2027, and R28.730M in May 2029).

Bantjies cannot pay this debt. With only **~6 months remaining** until the first payment deadline, his solution is to seize control of the Faucitt Family Trust assets (which include RegimA Worldwide Distribution and Villa Via Arcadia) through a curatorship application, and then eliminate the debt through his control as curator.

I attach a copy of the call option agreement showing the exact payment schedule as **Annexure JF_BANTJIES_DEBT**.

### Para 5: The Evidence

The evidence of this conspiracy is overwhelming and includes:

-   Trustee appointment documents (July 7, 2024)
-   Embezzlement reports sent to Bantjies (June 6 & 10, 2025)
-   Fabricated 2019 financial statements (issued June 25, 2025)
-   CIPC records proving the fabrication
-   "Main Trustee" letter sent to Bantjies (August 11, 2025, two days before the first interdict)
-   Bantjies' supporting affidavit (August 13, 2025)
-   SARS correspondence showing coordination between Rynette and Bantjies
-   Bank statements proving the R500k "birthday gift" narrative is false
-   Shopify invoices proving RegimA Worldwide Distribution has no independent revenue stream

---

## PART B: THE CURATORSHIP CONSPIRACY EXPOSED (Para 6-15)

### Para 6: Stage 1 - Trust Control (July 7, 2024)

On July 7, 2024, **Rynette Farrar Bantjies** (the Applicant's mother and Bantjies' wife) appointed **Bantjies as a Trustee** of the Faucitt Family Trust.

This gave Bantjies legal control over the Trust's assets, including RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd and Villa Via Arcadia (Pty) Ltd. Under the Trust deed, Trustees have the authority to control the financial investments of companies owned by the Trust.

This was the first step in the hostile takeover plan.

### Para 7: Stage 2 - Financial Sabotage (June 2025)

In June 2025, Daniel reported suspected **embezzlement** to Bantjies on two occasions (June 6 and June 10, 2025). Daniel provided evidence that:

-   Expenses were being loaded onto RegimA Worldwide Distribution to push it into insolvency.
-   Villa Via Arcadia was extracting funds through rent charges at an 86% profit margin.
-   The RegimA Group was being pushed into losses while Villa Via profited.

Bantjies, as a Trustee, had a fiduciary duty to investigate these reports. Instead, he **ignored them**—because he was orchestrating the embezzlement.

On June 7, 2025 (one day after Daniel filed a fraud report with SAPS), the Applicant's company credit cards were secretly cancelled, forcing all company expenses onto Daniel's personal bank account. This was a **deliberate act of financial sabotage** designed to create a financial crisis and the appearance of mismanagement.

### Para 8: Stage 3 - Cover-Up (June 25, 2025)

On June 25, 2025, **fabricated financial statements** for "RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd" for the year 2019 were issued. These accounts were signed by the Applicant and prepared by De Novo Business Services (the company secretary appointed by Rynette).

However, **CIPC records prove these accounts are fraudulent**:

-   The company was named **"K OZ CREATIVE"** in 2019, not "RegimA SA."
-   The Applicant was **not a director** in 2019; he was only appointed on March 9, 2021.
-   The name "RegimA SA" did not exist until March 9, 2021.

The fabricated accounts were created to:
1.  Conceal the true financial position of K OZ CREATIVE.
2.  Create a false narrative of financial mismanagement.
3.  Provide "evidence" for the curatorship application.

### Para 9: Stage 4 - Business Isolation (August 13, 2025)

On August 13, 2025, the Applicant filed the first ex parte interdict application. **Bantjies signed a supporting affidavit** for this application.

Two days earlier, on August 11, 2025, Rynette sent Bantjies a letter confirming his status as "Main Trustee" of the Faucitt Family Trust. This proves the interdict was a **premeditated step in the curatorship plan**.

The interdict resulted in:
-   Bank account freezes (financial strangulation)
-   CEO removal (isolation from business operations)
-   Communication restrictions

This was the beginning of **business isolation**—the first requirement for a curatorship application.

### Para 10: Stage 5 - Dependency (August-October 2025)

Following the first interdict, Daniel and I were subjected to **forced medical testing**, including psychiatric evaluations. A psychologist speculated that Daniel had a "gambling addiction," despite bank statements showing that all transactions were legitimate business expenses (including large Shopify platform fees).

The medical testing was designed to create **medical evidence of incapacity**—the second requirement for a curatorship application.

Simultaneously, the bank account freezes and financial restrictions forced Daniel to become **dependent** on the Applicant and Bantjies for access to funds—the third requirement for a curatorship application.

### Para 11: Stage 6 - Delinquency (November 4, 2025)

On November 4, 2025, the Applicant filed this third urgent interdict application, seeking to:

-   Ban me from all contact with the companies, employees, partners, and clientele.
-   Restrict all communication to the Applicant's attorneys during office hours only.

This is the final stage of **business isolation** and the creation of **delinquency**—the fourth requirement for a curatorship application.

The allegations in this application are deliberately framed to suggest that I am "harassing" staff and "disrupting" operations. In reality, I am exercising my **legitimate directorial rights** under the Companies Act (sections 26, 66, and 76) to investigate the embezzlement that Daniel reported to Bantjies in June 2025.

### Para 12: Stage 7 - Curatorship Application (Planned 2026)

The curatorship application is planned for 2026, before Bantjies' debt comes due in May 2026.

The application will argue that Daniel is incapable of managing his affairs, based on:

1.  **Business Isolation:** Three interdicts, bank freezes, CEO removal (proven by court records).
2.  **Dependency:** Financial control seized, reliance on others forced (proven by bank freezes).
3.  **Delinquency:** Fabricated accounts, false narrative of mismanagement (proven by fabricated 2019 accounts).
4.  **Medical Evidence:** Forced medical testing, speculation of gambling addiction (proven by psychologist report).

Once a curator is appointed (Bantjies or a proxy), they will have the legal authority to:

-   Seize control of the Trust assets.
-   "Forgive" Bantjies' ZAR 18.685M debt.
-   Dispossess the Applicant and myself of our Trust assets.

### Para 13: The Proxy Actors

The Applicant is not the mastermind of this conspiracy. He is a **pawn** being manipulated by Bantjies and Rynette.

**Evidence:**

-   The Applicant does not use a computer. All emails purportedly from him are sent by Rynette (proven by Sage screenshots showing Rynette using his email address).
-   Rynette appointed Bantjies as Trustee.
-   Rynette instructed De Novo to fabricate the 2019 accounts.
-   Rynette sent the "Main Trustee" letter to Bantjies two days before the first interdict.
-   Bantjies signed the supporting affidavit for the first interdict.

**Rynette is executing Bantjies' instructions, not the Applicant's.**

### Para 14: The Shell Company Fraud

The Shopify invoices prove that RegimA Worldwide Distribution has been operating as a **fraudulent shell company** since Kayla Faucitt's death on July 13, 2023.

The Shopify platform generating all revenue is **owned and paid for by RegimA Zone Ltd (UK)**, Daniel's UK company. RegimA Worldwide Distribution has **no independent revenue stream**.

Since Kayla's death:
-   Bantjies seized control of the Sage accounting system.
-   Rynette blocked platform fee transfers from the UK to South Africa.
-   RegimA Worldwide Distribution has been trading while insolvent for 2+ years.
-   **ZAR 60 million in fraudulent tax returns** have been filed.

The Applicant's claims of "financial mismanagement" are a **projection of Bantjies' and Rynette's own fraud**.

### Para 15: The R500k "Birthday Gift" Fabrication

The Applicant's claim that Daniel received a "R500k birthday gift" from me is **proven false** by bank statements.

**The truth:**

-   On June 7, 2025, the Applicant's company credit cards were secretly cancelled.
-   This forced all company expenses (R1.06 million over five months) onto Daniel's personal bank account.
-   Daniel transferred R597,500 from his own investment account to cover these expenses.
-   On July 16, 2025, when the account went negative, Daniel transferred R500,000 from his own company (Strategic Logistics) as **reimbursement**, not a "gift."

The bank statements show legitimate business expenses, including large Shopify platform fees. The "birthday gift" narrative is a **deliberate fabrication** used to justify the medical testing and the gambling addiction speculation.

---

## PART C: REFUTATION OF THE 3RD INTERDICT CLAIMS (Para 16-25)

### Para 16: The "Harassment" Allegation

The Applicant claims I "harassed" staff by demanding salary information on September 30, 2025.

**The truth:** I was exercising my **Companies Act section 26 right** to access financial records to investigate the embezzlement that Daniel reported to Bantjies in June 2025.

### Para 17: The "Disruption" Allegation

The Applicant claims I "disrupted" operations by wanting to attend training on October 7-8, 2025.

**The truth:** I was exercising my **Companies Act section 76 fiduciary duty** to oversee company operations and ensure proper training was being conducted.

### Para 18: The "Escalation" Allegation

The Applicant claims I "escalated misconduct" by demanding to be copied on correspondence since August 25, 2025.

**The truth:** I was exercising my **Companies Act section 66 right** to be informed of company affairs and to monitor for further embezzlement.

### Para 19: The "Unknown Transactions" Evidence

The Applicant references "unknown transactions" in Annexure AF10 (De Novo correspondence).

**This is the smoking gun.** The "unknown transactions" are the **fabricated accounts** that Rynette instructed De Novo to create. By referencing this evidence, the Applicant has inadvertently admitted the fraud exists.

### Para 20: The Projection of Guilt

Every allegation the Applicant makes against Daniel and me is a **projection of Bantjies' and Rynette's own crimes**:

| Applicant's Allegation | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Financial mismanagement" | Bantjies and Rynette are embezzling funds |
| "Illegitimate IT expenses" | Legitimate Shopify platform fees for UK company |
| "Misappropriation of funds" | Bantjies and Rynette are extracting funds via Villa Via |
| "Harassment of staff" | Investigating embezzlement reported to Bantjies |
| "Gambling addiction" | Fabricated narrative to justify medical testing |

### Para 21: The Temporal Proximity Pattern

The three interdict applications follow a clear **pattern of retaliation** against whistleblowing:

| Trigger Event | Interdict Application | Delay |
|---|---|---|
| Trustee document signed (Aug 11) | 1st interdict (Aug 13) | **2 days** |
| Mediation withdrawal (Sep 22) | 2nd interdict (Oct 2025) | **7-14 days** |
| Salary/training demands (Sep 30) | 3rd interdict (Nov 4) | **35 days** |

Each interdict is a **retaliation against legitimate oversight** and an escalation of the business isolation strategy.

### Para 22: The Obstruction of Justice

This third interdict is an **obstruction of justice**. By banning me from contacting staff, clients, and suppliers, the Applicant is preventing me from:

-   Investigating the embezzlement.
-   Gathering evidence of the fraud.
-   Discharging my fiduciary duties as a director.

This is a **Companies Act section 77 violation** (director interference) and a **common law crime** (obstruction of justice).

### Para 23: The Companies Act Violations

The Applicant's actions violate multiple provisions of the Companies Act:

-   **Section 26:** Denying access to financial records.
-   **Section 66:** Excluding a director from company affairs.
-   **Section 76:** Preventing a director from discharging fiduciary duties.
-   **Section 77:** Interfering with a director's exercise of powers.
-   **Section 162:** Delinquent director conduct (Bantjies and Rynette).
-   **Section 214:** False financial statements (fabricated 2019 accounts).

### Para 24: The Human Rights Violations

The sequential interdicts constitute **torture** under the Prevention and Combating of Torture of Persons Act 13 of 2013:

-   **Severe pain or suffering:** Bank freezes, CEO removal, forced medical experiments, communication bans.
-   **Intentional infliction:** Deliberate strategy to create dependency and delinquency.
-   **For a specific purpose:** To manufacture grounds for curatorship.
-   **By a person acting in an official capacity:** Using the Court's authority to legitimize the abuse.

### Para 25: The Interim Interdict Test Failures

The Applicant has failed to meet the requirements for an interim interdict:

1.  **Prima facie right:** The Applicant has no right to ban me from my own business.
2.  **Well-grounded apprehension of irreparable harm:** The only "harm" is the exposure of the embezzlement.
3.  **Balance of convenience:** The harm to me (business isolation, curatorship) far outweighs any alleged harm to the Applicant.
4.  **No alternative remedy:** The Applicant has multiple alternative remedies (shareholders' meeting, section 163 inquiry, arbitration).

---

## PART D: PRAYER FOR RELIEF (Para 26-30)

### Para 26: Dismissal of the 3rd Interdict

I pray that the Court dismiss the third interdict application with costs on an attorney-client scale.

### Para 27: Rescission of Previous Interdicts

I pray that the Court rescind the first and second interdicts on the grounds of:

-   Material non-disclosure (curatorship conspiracy).
-   Abuse of ex parte procedure.
-   Retaliatory motive.

### Para 28: Removal of Bantjies as Trustee

I pray that the Court order the removal of Bantjies as a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust on the grounds of:

-   Conflict of interest (ZAR 18.685M debt).
-   Breach of fiduciary duty (ignoring embezzlement reports).
-   Participation in a criminal conspiracy.

### Para 29: Criminal Prosecution

I pray that the Court refer this matter to the National Prosecuting Authority for criminal prosecution of Bantjies, Rynette, and the Applicant (if complicit) for:

-   Fraud (Companies Act section 214, common law).
-   Perjury (false statements in affidavits).
-   Tax fraud (ZAR 60M fraudulent returns).
-   Organized crime (POCA section 2).
-   Torture (Torture Act section 3).

### Para 30: Human Rights Investigation

I pray that the Court refer this matter to the South African Human Rights Commission for investigation of the human rights violations committed through the weaponization of the legal system.

---

## CONCLUSION

This is not a business dispute. This is a **criminal conspiracy** to seize control of the Faucitt Family Trust assets and eliminate a ZAR 18.685 million debt through a manufactured curatorship application.

The evidence is overwhelming, documented, and irrefutable. The Court is being used as a tool in a hostile takeover, and the Applicant is a pawn in a scheme orchestrated by Bantjies and Rynette.

I respectfully request that the Court see through this conspiracy, dismiss the interdict, and refer the matter for criminal prosecution.
