### 4.2 Section 77: Liability of Directors

**Personal Liability Established For:**

### 4.4 Operational Process vs. Fraudulent Actions

The Rynette Organogram (EVENT_ORG_001) documents a clear and legitimate sales process. This includes:

- **Dual-personnel order processing** by Kent (PERSON_037) and EL (PERSON_038).
- **Shopify-to-Sage automation** for tax invoice generation.
- **Third-party verification** via Courier Guy (PLATFORM_002).

This documented process stands in stark contrast to the fraudulent activities, demonstrating that the perpetrators knowingly and deliberately bypassed established procedures to commit fraud. The existence of this process documentation proves that the company had a defined, legitimate workflow, making the deviations even more egregious.
