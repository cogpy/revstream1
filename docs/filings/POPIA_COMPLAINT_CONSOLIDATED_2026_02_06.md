## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This consolidated complaint details systematic and willful violations of the Protection of Personal Information Act, 2013 (POPIA), by Peter Andrew Faucitt (Responsible Party) and Rynette Farrar (Operator). It integrates evidence from 30 historical versions, proving a criminal conspiracy to unlawfully process personal information to facilitate an R8.5M revenue hijacking scheme, motivated by the ZAR 18.75M Ketoni payout.

Conclusive evidence, including **Sage dual-account screenshots (SF2A)**, the **POPIA Violation Notice of 8 Jul 2025**, and Peter Faucitt's **FNB Fraud Letter (SF10)**, meets the criminal burden of proof for offenses under Section 107 of POPIA. The actions demonstrate a deliberate abuse of personal information, identity fraud, and obstruction of data subject rights, warranting immediate criminal prosecution.
