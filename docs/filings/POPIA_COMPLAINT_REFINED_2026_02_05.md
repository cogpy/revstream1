# POPIA Criminal Complaint

**Date:** 2026-02-05
**Case Number:** 2025-137857
**Complainant:** Daniel James Faucitt (Director, RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd)
**Respondent:** Peter Andrew Faucitt (Director, RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd)

## 1. Summary of Complaint

This complaint details a series of criminal offenses under the **Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA), 4 of 2013**, orchestrated by Peter Andrew Faucitt. The evidence shows a willful and intentional breach of data protection principles for the purpose of concealing fraudulent activities and retaliating against a fellow director who attempted to enforce compliance.

## 2. Offenses Under POPIA

### 2.1. Unlawful Processing of Personal Information (Section 11)

Peter Faucitt instructed employees to bypass the company's secure and audited Shopify system and process customer data using unauthorized domains and systems. This constitutes a direct violation of the lawfulness of processing principle.

**Evidence:**
- **Formal Notice (8 Jul 2025):** Daniel Faucitt issued a formal notice to Peter Faucitt explicitly stating that his "instructions to employees to bypass Shopify and use unauthorized domains for processing customer data" were illegal.
- **POPIA Violation Notice (8 Jul 2025):** A separate notice was sent detailing the customer data breach related to the May 22nd Shopify revenue stream diversion.

### 2.2. Failure to Secure Personal Information (Section 19)

By diverting customer order processing away from the secure Shopify platform to unknown, unaudited systems, Peter Faucitt willfully compromised the integrity and confidentiality of customer personal information, including names, addresses, and purchase histories.

### 2.3. Obstruction of the Regulator (Section 105) and Retaliation

The entire scheme was designed to create an unauditable revenue stream, thereby obstructing any potential investigation by the Information Regulator or SARS. Furthermore, Peter Faucitt's actions were a direct retaliation against Daniel Faucitt for attempting to enforce POPIA compliance.

**Evidence:**
- **Retaliation Timeline:**
    - **6 Jun 2025:** Daniel reports fraud concerns to the accountant.
    - **7 Jun 2025:** Peter cancels all of Daniel's bank cards (less than 24 hours later).
    - **8 Jul 2025:** Daniel sends the POPIA Violation Notice.
    - **13 Aug 2025:** Peter files a retaliatory ex parte court application, falsely framing the compliance demands as "harassment".

## 3. Conclusion

Peter Faucitt's actions were not accidental; they were a deliberate criminal strategy to facilitate fraud and silence a whistleblower. He knowingly compromised customer data and then weaponized the legal system when his actions were challenged. We urge the Information Regulator to pursue criminal charges against Peter Andrew Faucitt for these flagrant violations of POPIA, which carry a maximum penalty of **R10 million fine and/or 10 years imprisonment**.
