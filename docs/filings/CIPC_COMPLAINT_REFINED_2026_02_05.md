# CIPC Complaint: Application for Director Disqualification of Peter Andrew Faucitt

**Date:** 2026-02-05
**Case Number:** 2025-137857
**Complainant:** Daniel James Faucitt (Director, RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd)
**Respondent:** Peter Andrew Faucitt (Director, RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd)
**Company:** RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (2017/087935/07)

## 1. Introduction

This is an application to the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC) for a declaration of delinquency against Director Peter Andrew Faucitt under **Section 162(5) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008**. The application is based on overwhelming evidence of gross abuse of position, breach of fiduciary duties, and willful misconduct that has directly led to the financial ruin of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd.

## 2. Grounds for Delinquency: Breach of Fiduciary Duty (Section 76)

Director Peter Faucitt has fundamentally breached his fiduciary duties as outlined in Section 76 of the Companies Act. The evidence demonstrates a coordinated and intentional effort to destroy the company to inflict harm on his co-director, Daniel Faucitt.

### 2.1. Intentional Financial Sabotage

**Evidence:**
- **Bank Statements (Oct 2024 vs. Mar 2025):** In October 2024, RegimA SA held a healthy balance of **R2,554,860.93**. By March 2025, just before the main revenue stream was diverted, the account had been systematically stripped to a mere **R5,284.08**—a 99.8% decline. This demonstrates a clear pattern of asset stripping.
- **Shopify Revenue Diversion (May 2025):** The company's primary revenue stream, generating **R8.5 million annually** via Shopify, was completely diverted starting around May 22, 2025. Sales reports show a drop from over R948,000 in May 2025 to **R0.00 in June 2025**.
- **Shopify Payment Failures (Sep-Oct 2025):** As a direct result of the revenue diversion, the company defaulted on its Shopify platform fees, with **9 consecutive payment failures** recorded.

### 2.2. Gross Abuse of Position

**Evidence:**
- **CIPC Records:** Official records confirm Peter Faucitt and Daniel Faucitt are the sole active directors of RegimA SA. Jacqui Faucitt is not a director or shareholder, yet Peter Faucitt acted in concert with non-directors (e.g., Rynette Farrar) to undermine the company.
- **Formal Notice (8 Jul 2025):** Daniel Faucitt issued a formal notice demanding Peter cease his criminal instructions to bypass Shopify. Peter Faucitt ignored this notice and instead retaliated with vexatious litigation 36 days later.
- **Premeditation (11 Apr 2025):** An organogram created by Rynette Farrar for Peter Faucitt 40 days before the sabotage proves he had full knowledge of Shopify's critical role in the business, establishing clear premeditation.

## 3. Conclusion

Peter Faucitt has intentionally and maliciously destroyed a profitable company in breach of his fiduciary duties. He has:
1.  Systematically stripped its assets.
2.  Diverted its entire revenue stream.
3.  Caused it to default on its critical operational platforms.
4.  Ignored formal notices to cease his unlawful conduct.

His actions constitute a textbook case for a declaration of delinquency. We request the CIPC to investigate and disqualify Peter Andrew Faucitt from serving as a director of any company.
