# Report to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA): Tax Fraud

**Date:** 2026-02-05
**Case Number:** 2025-137857
**Reporting Party:** Daniel James Faucitt
**Subjects:** Peter Andrew Faucitt, Rynette Farrar, De Novo Business Services (Pty) Ltd, Marisca Meyer

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details a sophisticated tax fraud scheme involving the fabrication of financial statements, fraudulent allocation of expenses, and the creation of false inter-company loan accounts. The evidence points to a coordinated effort to under-report income and create fictitious expenses for RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (Tax No. 9746755165).

## 2. Evidence of Financial Statement Fabrication

The most damning piece of evidence is a set of **Annual Financial Statements for RegimA SA for the period ending 28 February 2019**, which were **created and issued on 25 June 2025**.

**Evidence:**
- **Document:** *Regima SA (Pty) Ltd - 2019 - Financial statements - SME.pdf*
- **Key Fraud Indicators:**
    1.  **Impossible Issue Date:** The statements for the 2019 financial year were fabricated over six years later.
    2.  **Complicit Accountant:** The preparer, Marisca Meyer of De Novo Business Services, is the same accountant who received instructions to create fraudulent records.
    3.  **Timing:** The statements were created just seven days after Rynette Farrar instructed De Novo to create fraudulent loan accounts to hide expenses.
    4.  **Lack of Oversight:** The statements were not audited or independently reviewed, and were created without the knowledge of co-director Daniel Faucitt.

## 3. Evidence of Fraudulent Expense Allocation

Email correspondence proves that Rynette Farrar, an accountant manager at RegimA, instructed the company's external accountants, De Novo Business Services, to commit accounting fraud.

**Evidence:**
- **Document:** *2025-06-18 - Rynette & De Novo - RegimA SA Payments.pdf*
- **Rynette Farrar's Instructions (17-18 Jun 2025):**
    > "No, I think the best will be to create a loan account within RegimA SA, for the other company. Then these invoice (not belonging to RegimA SA) can be allocated to this loan account."
    > "The expenses for the Coral draw and Quickbooks do not belong to this company, so I suggest you open a loan account for one of Danny's other company's called Rezonance and post these expenses then to Rezonance's loan account."

This is a direct instruction to misrepresent expenses and create false inter-company loans to defraud SARS.

## 4. Conclusion

This evidence demonstrates a clear and deliberate conspiracy to commit tax fraud in violation of the **Tax Administration Act, 28 of 2011**. The back-dated financial statements and the explicit instructions to create fraudulent records constitute a prima facie case. We request the NPA to launch a full criminal investigation into the actions of Peter Faucitt, Rynette Farrar, and the complicit accounting firm De Novo Business Services and its employee Marisca Meyer.
