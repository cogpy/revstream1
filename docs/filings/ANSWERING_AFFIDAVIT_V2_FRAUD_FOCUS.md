# Answering Affidavit Structure (V2 - Fraud Focus)
## Case 2025-137857: 3rd Urgent Application

**Date:** 2025-11-18  
**Author:** Manus AI  
**Focus:** Reframing the narrative around the discovery of accounting fraud

---

## Executive Summary

This revised structure transforms the answering affidavit from a defensive document into an offensive one. It reframes every allegation of "harassment" as the legitimate discharge of fiduciary duties by a director who has uncovered evidence of systematic accounting fraud. The central theme is that the Applicant is abusing court process to obstruct a fraud investigation.

---

## Part A: Preliminary Matters (Para 1-4)

**Para 1: Identity and Locus Standi**
- Deponent: Jacqueline Faucitt
- Identity, capacity as director of Third Respondent, member of Fourth-Sixth Respondents

**Para 2: Purpose of this Affidavit**
- To oppose the urgent application filed on November 4, 2025.
- To demonstrate that the application is an abuse of process, designed to obstruct a legitimate fraud investigation.
- To pray for the dismissal of the application with a punitive costs order.

**Para 3: Point in Limine: Lack of Urgency**
- The events complained of occurred in late September 2025.
- The Applicant waited over a month to file this "urgent" application.
- The First Respondent had already undertaken not to attend the training session, resolving the immediate issue.
- The urgency is self-created and tactical, not genuine.

**Para 4: Point in Limine: Abuse of Process**
- This is the **third sequential interdict application** filed in three months.
- Each application has followed the Respondents exercising legitimate rights or demanding accountability.
- This pattern demonstrates a campaign of retaliatory litigation, not a bona fide attempt to protect business interests.
- The Court's process is being used as a weapon of oppression.

## Part B: The True Context: Discovery of Accounting Fraud (Para 5-9)

**Para 5: The "Unknown Transactions" Are Evidence of Fraud**
- The Applicant's affidavit (Para 7.5) refers to "unknown transactions" and correspondence with accountants (Annexure AF10).
- This is a gross misrepresentation. These are not mere irregularities; they are evidence of **systematic accounting fraud**.

**Para 6: The Fabricated Financial Statements**
- Evidence shows that Rynette Farrar Bantjies instructed De Novo accountants to create financial statements for "RegimA SA" for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.
- These statements are **fraudulent** because the company was named "K-Oz Creative" during that period and had different ownership.
- Attach CIPC records showing the company's true history and name change in 2023.

**Para 7: Destruction of Evidence**
- The same correspondence (Annexure AF10) reveals instructions to **remove the Second Respondent's (Daniel's) QuickBooks records**.
- This constitutes the destruction of the true financial records and their replacement with fabricated accounts.

**Para 8: My Fiduciary Duty to Investigate**
- As a director, I have a fiduciary duty under **Section 76 of the Companies Act** to act with care, skill, and diligence, and in the best interests of the company.
- Upon discovering evidence of this fraud in or around August 2025, I was legally and ethically obligated to investigate.

**Para 9: The Applicant's True Motive: Obstruction of Justice**
- Every action the Applicant complains of was a direct result of my investigation into this fraud.
- This application, which seeks to sever my contact with the company and its accountants, is a transparent attempt to **obstruct my investigation** and conceal the fraud.

## Part C: Answering the Allegations: Fiduciary Duty in Action (Para 10-13)

**Para 10: Re: Demanding Correspondence (Applicant's Para 7.2-7.5)**
- My demand to be copied on correspondence, particularly with the accountants De Novo, was not "harassment."
- It was the **exercise of my directorial right and duty** to access company records (Section 26) to investigate the fraudulent accounting I had discovered.
- The Applicant seeks to prevent me from obtaining further evidence.

**Para 11: Re: Demanding Salary (Applicant's Para 6.2-6.5)**
- My inquiry about remuneration is a legitimate right of a director.
- More importantly, in the context of discovering that millions in revenue were being funneled through a system I had no access to (controlled by Rynette), my inquiries were aimed at understanding the true financial state of the company and how funds were being disbursed.

**Para 12: Re: Attending Company Premises (Applicant's Para 6.6-6.9)**
- My intention to attend the company's premises and training sessions was to exercise my oversight duty as a director.
- The Applicant's claim that I would be "disruptive" is a self-serving attempt to justify his unlawful exclusion of a director from the company's operations, precisely at the time she is uncovering wrongdoing.

**Para 13: Summary: My Actions Were Lawful, Justified, and Necessary**
- Every action the Applicant complains of was a reasonable and necessary step in the investigation of serious financial misconduct.
- It is the Applicant who is acting unlawfully by seeking to use the Court to aid and abet the concealment of this fraud.

---

## Part D: Disproportionate and Punitive Relief (Para 14-15)

**Para 14: The Relief Sought is a Disguised Removal of a Director**
- The Applicant seeks to prohibit me from having any contact with the companies, their employees, partners, or clientele.
- This would make it impossible for me to perform my duties as a director.
- This is not a protective interdict; it is a de facto removal of a director, for which the Applicant has followed no lawful process.

**Para 15: The Relief Would Enable Further Fraud**
- Granting the order would have the perverse effect of allowing the perpetrators of the accounting fraud to continue their activities without oversight.
- The Court would be sanctioning the silencing of a whistleblower.

---

## Part E: Conclusion and Prayer (Para 16-18)

**Para 16: Summary of Argument**
- This application is a gross abuse of process.
- It is the third in a series of retaliatory applications.
- It is based on a deliberate misrepresentation of the facts.
- Its true purpose is to obstruct the investigation of accounting fraud.

**Para 17: Costs**
- The Applicant's conduct is vexatious and malicious.
- He has misled the Court in three separate applications.
- A punitive costs order on the attorney and own client scale is warranted.

**Para 18: Prayer**
- WHEREFORE I pray that the application be dismissed with costs on the attorney and own client scale.
