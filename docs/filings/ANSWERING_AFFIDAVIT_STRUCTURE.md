# Answering Affidavit Structure
## Case 2025-137857: Revenue Stream Hijacking

**Date:** 2025-11-18  
**Document Type:** Answering Affidavit - Paragraph-by-Paragraph Structure  
**Author:** Manus AI

---

## Document Overview

This answering affidavit structure is organized to systematically address the founding affidavit while building a multi-layered legal argument based on four juridical theories. The structure follows the principle of gradual revelation, allowing connections between perpetrators and misconduct to become self-evident without overt accusations, while maintaining a neutral and professional tone suitable for court proceedings.

**Legal Theories Integrated:**
1. Abuse of Ex Parte Procedure (*Schlesinger*, *Basson*)
2. Retaliatory Motive/Malice (*Beinash v Wixley*)
3. Corporate Misconduct (Companies Act s 76, s 162)
4. Trustee Misconduct (Trust Property Control Act)

## Part A: Preliminary Matters

### Section 1: Introduction and Locus Standi

**Para 1: Identity and Capacity**

I, [RESPONDENT NAME], the [First/Second] Respondent in this matter, state under oath as follows. I am an adult [male/female] and a [South African citizen/permanent resident]. I am duly authorized to depose to this affidavit on behalf of myself and, where applicable, in my capacity as [director/beneficiary/operator] of the relevant entities. The facts contained herein are within my personal knowledge unless otherwise stated, and are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

**Para 2: Purpose of Affidavit**

This affidavit is filed in response to the Applicant's founding affidavit and the interim interdict granted ex parte on [DATE]. The purpose of this affidavit is threefold: first, to place before this Honourable Court material facts that were not disclosed in the founding affidavit; second, to demonstrate that the factual substratum upon which the interim relief was granted is fundamentally flawed; and third, to seek the rescission of the interim interdict under Rule 42(1)(a) of the Uniform Rules of Court on the grounds of material non-disclosure, misrepresentation, and erroneously granted relief.

**Para 3: Structure of Response**

This affidavit is structured to address each material allegation in the founding affidavit in a systematic manner. However, I respectfully submit that when the evidence is reorganized chronologically and by role-responsibility, a coherent pattern emerges which directly contradicts the narrative presented by the Applicant. This pattern reveals not a bona fide attempt to protect corporate interests, but rather a coordinated campaign of retaliation against beneficiaries and directors who sought to fulfill their fiduciary duties and expose financial misconduct.

---

## Part B: Material Non-Disclosure (Theory 001)

### Section 2: Actual Control Structure

**Para 4: Misrepresentation of Operational Control**

The founding affidavit creates the impression that the Applicant exercised operational and financial control over the relevant entities. This representation is materially false. The Applicant had no operational role in the day-to-day management of [COMPANY NAMES]. The actual control structure, which was deliberately omitted from the founding affidavit, reveals that financial systems were controlled by [RYNETTE FARRAR] and that strategic decisions were made by [DANIE BANTJIES], who held the undisclosed position of Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust.

**Evidence Reference:** Control relations REL_CTRL_001, REL_CTRL_002; Events EVENT_001, EVENT_003

**Para 5: Bantjies' Hidden Trustee Role**

Material to this Court's assessment of the application is the fact that Danie Bantjies was, at all relevant times, a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust. This fact was not disclosed in the founding affidavit. Bantjies exercised ultimate financial control over the trust-owned entities, including RegimA Worldwide (Pty) Ltd and Villa Via (Pty) Ltd. The Applicant's failure to disclose Bantjies' trustee status and his exercise of financial control constitutes a material non-disclosure, as it directly undermines the Applicant's asserted locus standi and operational authority.

**Evidence Reference:** Trust documents; Email correspondence showing Rynette acting "under instruction of Bantjies"; Financial records showing Bantjies' decision-making authority

**Para 6: Rynette Farrar's Financial Systems Control**

The founding affidavit fails to disclose that Rynette Farrar exercised exclusive control over all financial systems, accounting software, and banking access for the relevant entities. Rynette controlled the Applicant's email address (pete@regima.com), as evidenced by Sage screenshots from June and August 2025. The Applicant himself had no access to financial systems or bank accounts. This omission is material because it demonstrates that the alleged "interference" by the Respondents was not with the Applicant's operations, but rather with a system controlled by third parties who were engaged in systematic financial misconduct.

**Evidence Reference:** Sage screenshots (June 2025, August 2025); Email access logs; Banking authorization records; Event EVENT_004

**Para 7: Inversion of Payment Flows**

The founding affidavit suggests that payment flows operated from South Africa to the United Kingdom, with the implication that the Respondents were improperly diverting South African revenues to UK entities. This representation inverts the actual direction of payment flows. The evidence demonstrates that Daniel Faucitt's UK company, RegimA Zone Ltd, funded and paid for the Shopify e-commerce platform that generated revenues for the South African entities. RegimA Zone Ltd paid for this platform continuously for 28+ months (since July 2023), representing an investment of between R140,000 and R280,000. The South African entity, RWD ZA (Pty) Ltd, merely issued invoices for sales generated on infrastructure it neither owned nor funded.

**Evidence Reference:** RegimA Zone UK bank statements showing Shopify payments; Shopify invoices; Platform ownership documentation; Event EVENT_002 (Shopify platform establishment)

**Para 8: Omission of Revenues vs. Expenses Context**

The founding affidavit characterizes certain IT and platform expenses as "unexplainable" or excessive. This characterization omits the critical context that these expenses supported revenue generation of over R1,000,000 per month. The Applicant failed to disclose that the revenues generated through the Shopify platform and related infrastructure far exceeded the operational expenses. This omission is material because it creates a false impression of wasteful expenditure, when in fact the expenditures were essential to revenue generation and represented a positive return on investment.

**Evidence Reference:** Revenue reports (March-September 2025); Shopify sales data; Financial statements showing revenue vs. expense ratios

**Para 9: Omission of Respondents' Legitimate Roles**

The founding affidavit fails to disclose Daniel Faucitt's role in UK compliance, logistics, and operations. Daniel was responsible for ensuring compliance with UK and EU regulations, managing international logistics, and operating the e-commerce platform. Jacqueline Faucitt was the only Responsible Person for EU compliance under applicable regulations. These roles were not discretionary or peripheral; they were essential to the lawful operation of the business. The Applicant's failure to disclose these roles is material because it creates the false impression that the Respondents' activities were unauthorized interference rather than the fulfillment of legal and operational obligations.

**Evidence Reference:** EU compliance documentation; Responsible Person designation; Operational records; Platform access logs (REL_CTRL_003, REL_CTRL_004)

---

## Part C: Retaliatory Motive (Theory 002)

### Section 3: Chronological Inference of Malice

**Para 10: Legal Principle of Temporal Proximity**

South African courts have long recognized that temporal proximity between a triggering event and a retaliatory response can give rise to a prima facie inference of malice and ulterior motive. In *Beinash v Wixley* 1997 (3) SA 721 (SCA), the Supreme Court of Appeal held that litigation instituted for an ulterior purpose may be set aside as an abuse of process. The sequence of events in this matter demonstrates a clear pattern of retaliation, not bona fide corporate protection.

**Para 11: Sequence 1 - Debt Confrontation and Data Destruction**

On 15 May 2025, Jacqueline Faucitt confronted Rynette Farrar regarding a debt of R1,035,000 owed by RegimA Skin Treatments (Pty) Ltd to ReZonance (Pty) Ltd since February 2023. Jacqueline stated that these funds were part of the estate of the late Kayla Faucitt and that retaining them would constitute profiting from the proceeds of a crime. Seven days later, on 22 May 2025, the Shopify platform's audit trails and historical order data were systematically destroyed. This destruction occurred despite the fact that the platform was owned and operated by Daniel and Jacqueline, not by the Applicant or his associates. The temporal proximity of seven days, combined with the specific targeting of evidence related to the confronted debt, gives rise to a strong inference that the data destruction was retaliatory in nature and intended to conceal evidence of financial misconduct.

**Evidence Reference:** Event EVENT_007 (confrontation, 15 May 2025); Event EVENT_009 (data destruction, 22 May 2025); Email correspondence; Shopify system logs; Debt documentation

**Para 12: Sequence 2 - Fraud Report and Payment Sabotage**

On 6 June 2025, Daniel Faucitt submitted a comprehensive fraud report to Danie Bantjies, detailing systematic financial irregularities including unauthorized payments, payment redirection schemes, and asset dissipation. One day later, on 7 June 2025, Daniel's payment cards were cancelled without notice or authorization, and his access to critical payment systems was terminated. This action was taken despite the fact that Daniel was personally responsible for paying creditors and maintaining business operations. The temporal proximity of one day is exceptionally strong evidence of retaliatory motive. The cancellation of payment capabilities immediately following a fraud report demonstrates that the purpose was not to protect the business, but to punish the whistleblower and obstruct his ability to fulfill his operational responsibilities.

**Evidence Reference:** Event EVENT_011 (fraud report, 6 June 2025); Event EVENT_012 (card cancellations, 7 June 2025); Fraud report documentation; Banking records; Creditor payment records

**Para 13: Sequence 3 - Villa Via Exposure and Audit Blocking**

In early June 2025, Daniel Faucitt exposed evidence of systematic profit extraction by Villa Via (Pty) Ltd from the group of companies. The evidence revealed that Villa Via had extracted R22,800,000 in capital over the relevant period, primarily through inflated rent charges (86% profit margin on rent). Daniel proposed a forensic audit to investigate these irregularities. Five days after this proposal, Danie Bantjies dismissed the need for a forensic audit and blocked any further investigation. This temporal proximity, combined with Bantjies' undisclosed conflict of interest (he owed R18,685,000 to the Faucitt Family Trust), demonstrates that the blocking of the audit was motivated by a desire to conceal misconduct, not by legitimate business considerations.

**Evidence Reference:** Villa Via financial analysis; Rent profit margin calculations; Event EVENT_025 (audit proposal); Event EVENT_026 (audit blocking); Bantjies debt documentation (REL_DEBT_002)

**Para 14: Sequence 4 - Trustee Document and Interdict Launch**

On 11 August 2025, Jacqueline Faucitt signed a document that backdated the Applicant's designation as "Main Trustee" of the Faucitt Family Trust to 1 July 2025. This document was signed at the request of the Applicant and Bantjies. Two days later, on 13 August 2025, the Applicant and Bantjies, acting as co-trustees, launched the present interdict application, naming Jacqueline as a respondent. The temporal proximity of two days, combined with the fact that Jacqueline was included in the interdict immediately after providing the requested documentation, demonstrates that the interdict was not a bona fide attempt to protect trust assets, but rather a punitive measure against a beneficiary who had cooperated with the trustees' requests and who had been actively seeking accountability for financial misconduct.

**Evidence Reference:** Trustee designation document (11 August 2025); Interdict application (13 August 2025); Event EVENT_025, EVENT_026; Trust documentation

**Para 15: Pattern of Retaliation - Consolidated Analysis**

When these four sequences are viewed together, a clear and unmistakable pattern emerges. Each instance of the Respondents exercising fiduciary duties, demanding accountability, or exposing financial misconduct was met with a swift retaliatory response within 1-7 days. The responses were not proportionate business decisions; they were targeted acts designed to punish, obstruct, and silence. This pattern satisfies the legal test for chronological inference of malice and demonstrates that the interdict application itself is part of this retaliatory campaign, not a legitimate exercise of corporate or trust authority.

## Part D: Interim Interdict Test Failures

### Section 4: Prima Facie Right

**Para 16: Applicant's Lack of Operational Authority**

The first requirement for an interim interdict is that the applicant must demonstrate a prima facie right. The Applicant asserted a right to control the operations and systems of the relevant entities. However, the evidence demonstrates that the Applicant had no operational role, no access to financial systems, no authority over banking, and no involvement in day-to-day management. The actual control was exercised by Rynette Farrar (financial systems) and Danie Bantjies (strategic decisions). The Applicant therefore lacked the prima facie right he asserted, as the factual substratum of control, authority, and operational responsibility was fundamentally misrepresented.

**Evidence Reference:** Control structure documentation; Access logs; Banking authorizations; Email control evidence

**Para 17: Respondents' Fiduciary Duties**

Conversely, the Respondents were fulfilling legitimate fiduciary duties. Daniel Faucitt, as a director and shareholder of certain entities, had a duty under section 76 of the Companies Act to act with care, skill, and diligence, and to act in the best interests of the company. Jacqueline Faucitt, as a beneficiary of the Faucitt Family Trust and as the Responsible Person for EU compliance, had both a right and a duty to demand accountability from the trustees and to ensure regulatory compliance. The actions characterized by the Applicant as "interference" were, in fact, the proper exercise of fiduciary and legal duties. The Applicant's prima facie right therefore fails because the Respondents had superior rights grounded in statute, common law fiduciary duties, and regulatory obligations.

**Evidence Reference:** Companies Act s 76; Trust Property Control Act; EU compliance regulations; Fiduciary duty case law

---

### Section 5: Irreparable Harm

**Para 18: Harm Manufactured by Applicant**

The second requirement for an interim interdict is a reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm. The Applicant asserted that the Respondents' actions would cause irreparable harm to the business. However, the evidence demonstrates that the harm to the business flowed entirely from the Applicant's side, not from the Respondents. The cancellation of payment cards, the destruction of Shopify audit trails, the blocking of revenue streams, and the termination of system access all originated from the Applicant's associates (Rynette Farrar, Danie Bantjies). These actions caused immediate and quantifiable harm: creditors could not be paid, operations were disrupted, and revenue generation was sabotaged. The Applicant manufactured the harm relied upon to ground urgency, and then sought an interdict to prevent the Respondents from remedying that harm.

**Evidence Reference:** Card cancellation records (EVENT_012); Shopify data destruction (EVENT_009); Revenue disruption documentation; Creditor payment failures

**Para 19: Six Months of Systematic Sabotage**

The harm to the business was not sudden or unexpected; it was the culmination of six months of systematic sabotage (March 2025 - September 2025). This sabotage included: (a) diversion of revenues starting 1 March 2025; (b) fraudulent bank change letters on 14 April 2025; (c) removal of orders from Shopify on 23 May 2025; (d) secret card cancellations on 7 June 2025; (e) email redirection instructions on 20 June 2025; and (f) complete account emptying on 11 September 2025. The Applicant's assertion of "irreparable harm" caused by the Respondents is contradicted by the documented evidence of harm caused by the Applicant's own associates over a sustained period. The requirement of irreparable harm therefore fails because the Applicant cannot rely on harm that he and his associates created.

**Evidence Reference:** Timeline of sabotage events (March-September 2025); Financial impact documentation (R10,269,727.90 total); Revenue diversion records; Bank change letters

---

### Section 6: Balance of Convenience

**Para 20: Operational Necessity of Respondents' Roles**

The third requirement for an interim interdict is that the balance of convenience must favor the granting of relief. The evidence demonstrates that the balance of convenience overwhelmingly disfavors the interdict. Jacqueline Faucitt is the only Responsible Person for EU compliance under applicable regulations. Without her involvement, the business cannot lawfully operate in the EU market. Daniel Faucitt operates the Shopify platform that generates over R1,000,000 in monthly revenue. His UK company owns and pays for this platform. Without his involvement, the revenue stream ceases entirely. The interdict therefore causes far greater harm than it prevents: it destroys regulatory compliance, eliminates the primary revenue stream, and prevents the Respondents from fulfilling their legal and operational obligations.

**Evidence Reference:** EU Responsible Person designation; Shopify revenue reports; Platform ownership documentation; Regulatory compliance requirements

**Para 21: Harm to Creditors and Third Parties**

The interdict also causes significant harm to third parties, including creditors, suppliers, and employees. Daniel Faucitt was personally responsible for paying creditors using his own funds and payment systems. The interdict prevents him from continuing these payments, resulting in harm to innocent third parties who have no involvement in the dispute between the Applicant and Respondents. The balance of convenience must take into account the interests of these third parties, and when it does, it becomes clear that the interdict causes widespread harm while providing no corresponding benefit to any legitimate interest.

**Evidence Reference:** Creditor payment records; Supplier contracts; Employee payment documentation

---

### Section 7: Alternative Remedies

**Para 22: Availability of Internal Remedies**

The fourth requirement for an interim interdict is that there must be no adequate alternative remedy. This requirement is not satisfied. Internal remedies were available through the company structures, including board resolutions, shareholder meetings, and trustee meetings. Mediation was underway at the time the interdict was sought. The Applicant made no attempt to exhaust these internal remedies before seeking the drastic and disproportionate relief of an interdict. The interdict was therefore not the least restrictive means of addressing the Applicant's concerns, and it fails the test of legal proportionality.

**Evidence Reference:** Company governance documents; Mediation correspondence; Trust deed provisions for dispute resolution

---

## Part E: Corporate Misconduct (Theory 003)

### Section 8: Companies Act Violations

**Para 23: Section 76 Breaches - Duty of Care**

Section 76(3) of the Companies Act imposes on directors a duty to act with the degree of care, skill, and diligence that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same functions and having the general knowledge, skill, and experience of that director. The evidence demonstrates systematic breaches of this duty by the Applicant and his associates. These breaches include: (a) sabotage of operational systems; (b) unauthorized payments totaling R4,276,832.85; (c) asset dissipation totaling R10,269,727.90; (d) operational destruction through revenue stream hijacking; and (e) misrepresentations in affidavits filed with this Court. None of these actions can be characterized as the exercise of care, skill, or diligence. They represent gross negligence at best, and willful misconduct at worst.

**Evidence Reference:** Companies Act s 76(3); Financial loss documentation; Operational sabotage records; Affidavit misrepresentations

**Para 24: Section 76 Breaches - Proper Purpose**

Section 76(3) also requires directors to act for a proper purpose and in the best interests of the company. The evidence demonstrates that the Applicant's actions were not taken for a proper purpose. The interdict was not sought to protect the company; it was sought to shield misconduct and punish whistleblowing. The systematic sabotage of operations was not in the company's best interests; it destroyed revenue streams and operational capacity. The blocking of forensic audits was not in the company's best interests; it prevented the detection and remediation of financial irregularities. These actions satisfy the definition of acting for an improper purpose, in breach of section 76(3).

**Evidence Reference:** Companies Act s 76(3); Purpose analysis; Whistleblowing documentation; Audit blocking evidence

**Para 25: Section 162 - Delinquency of Directors**

Section 162 of the Companies Act provides for a declaration of delinquency where a director has engaged in gross abuse of position, dishonesty, or willful misconduct. The conduct documented in this affidavit satisfies these criteria. The gross abuse of position is evidenced by the use of directorial authority to sabotage operations and punish whistleblowers. The dishonesty is evidenced by the material misrepresentations in the founding affidavit. The willful misconduct is evidenced by the deliberate destruction of audit trails and the systematic diversion of revenues. The Respondents reserve the right to seek a declaration of delinquency against the Applicant and his associates in separate proceedings.

**Evidence Reference:** Companies Act s 162; Delinquency criteria; Misconduct documentation

---

## Part F: Trustee Misconduct (Theory 004)

### Section 9: Trust Property Control Act Violations

**Para 26: Breach of Utmost Good Faith**

The Trust Property Control Act and common law impose on trustees a duty of utmost good faith (*uberrima fides*). This duty requires trustees to act with complete honesty and transparency in all dealings affecting the trust. The evidence demonstrates systematic breaches of this duty. Danie Bantjies concealed his trustee status from beneficiaries and co-directors. The Applicant and Bantjies concealed the R18,685,000 debt owed by Bantjies to the trust, creating a massive conflict of interest. The trustees failed to disclose the profit extraction scheme operated through Villa Via. These omissions and concealments constitute breaches of the duty of utmost good faith.

**Evidence Reference:** Trust Property Control Act; Common law fiduciary duties; Bantjies debt documentation (REL_DEBT_002); Villa Via profit extraction analysis

**Para 27: Conflict of Interest**

Trustees have a duty to avoid conflicts of interest, or where conflicts are unavoidable, to disclose them fully and recuse themselves from affected decisions. Danie Bantjies owed R18,685,000 to the Faucitt Family Trust. This debt created a direct financial incentive for Bantjies to block investigations, conceal misconduct, and prevent beneficiaries from demanding accountability. Despite this obvious conflict, Bantjies did not disclose the debt, did not recuse himself from decisions affecting the trust, and actively participated in blocking the forensic audit that would have revealed the debt. This conduct constitutes a clear breach of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest.

**Evidence Reference:** Conflict of interest documentation; Bantjies debt records; Audit blocking correspondence

**Para 28: Duty to Preserve Trust Assets**

Trustees have a duty to preserve trust assets and to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries. The evidence demonstrates that the trustees breached this duty by allowing Villa Via to extract R22,800,000 in capital from trust-owned entities through inflated rent charges. The trustees also breached this duty by allowing systematic revenue diversion and payment redirection schemes that depleted trust assets by over R10,000,000. Rather than preserving trust assets, the trustees facilitated their dissipation for the benefit of third parties and to the detriment of the beneficiaries.

**Evidence Reference:** Trust asset documentation; Villa Via capital extraction analysis; Revenue diversion records; Financial loss calculations

**Para 29: Retaliation Against Beneficiaries**

Beneficiaries of a trust have a right to demand accountability from trustees and to seek information about trust affairs. When Jacqueline Faucitt and Daniel Faucitt, as beneficiaries, exercised this right by confronting trustees about financial irregularities, they were met with retaliation. The interdict functions as a weapon to punish beneficiaries for demanding accountability. This use of trust powers to silence and punish beneficiaries constitutes a fundamental breach of fiduciary duty and an abuse of the trust structure.

**Evidence Reference:** Beneficiary rights documentation; Accountability demands; Retaliatory sequence evidence (Para 11-14)

---

## Part G: Rescission and Relief

### Section 10: Rule 42 Rescission Application

**Para 30: Grounds for Rescission**

Rule 42(1)(a) of the Uniform Rules of Court provides that the Court may rescind any order erroneously sought or erroneously granted. The interim interdict in this matter was erroneously granted due to material non-disclosure and misrepresentation in the founding affidavit. The test in *Schlesinger v Schlesinger* 1979 (4) SA 342 (W) is clear: any misrepresentation in an ex parte application is grounds for rescission. The founding affidavit contained multiple material misrepresentations, including: (a) misrepresented payment flows; (b) omitted control structures; (c) omitted motives and conflicts of interest; (d) omitted retaliatory chronology; (e) omitted context of expenses vs. revenues; and (f) omitted fiduciary actions by Respondents. Each of these misrepresentations, individually and collectively, would have materially influenced the Court's decision to grant interim relief.

**Evidence Reference:** Rule 42(1)(a); *Schlesinger* test; Material non-disclosure documentation (Para 4-9)

**Para 31: Materiality of Omissions**

A fact is material if it might have influenced the Court in deciding whether to grant relief. Had this Honourable Court been aware of the actual control structure, the retaliatory chronology, the conflicts of interest, and the Respondents' legitimate fiduciary roles, the Court would not have granted ex parte relief without hearing the Respondents. The omissions were not peripheral or technical; they went to the heart of the application. They affected the assessment of prima facie right, irreparable harm, balance of convenience, and alternative remedies. The omissions were therefore material in law, and the order was erroneously granted.

**Evidence Reference:** Materiality test; Impact analysis; Interim interdict requirements

**Para 32: Fraud on the Court**

The systematic nature of the misrepresentations and omissions in the founding affidavit amounts to a fraud on the Court. The Applicant presented a carefully constructed narrative that inverted reality: portraying himself as the victim when he was the perpetrator, portraying the Respondents as interfering when they were fulfilling duties, and portraying the interdict as protective when it was retaliatory. This deliberate distortion of facts to obtain judicial relief constitutes a fraud on the Court and provides an independent ground for rescission.

**Evidence Reference:** Fraud on the court doctrine; Systematic misrepresentation analysis; Narrative inversion documentation

---

### Section 11: Relief Sought

**Para 33: Rescission of Interim Interdict**

In light of the material non-disclosure, the failures of the interim interdict test, and the evidence of abuse of process, the Respondents respectfully seek the rescission of the interim interdict granted on [DATE]. The order was erroneously sought and erroneously granted, and it should be set aside with costs.

**Para 34: Costs on Attorney-Client Scale**

The Respondents further seek costs on an attorney-and-client scale, or alternatively on a punitive scale. The Applicant's conduct in bringing this application with material non-disclosures and misrepresentations justifies a costs order that reflects the seriousness of the abuse of process. The Respondents have been forced to incur substantial legal costs to defend against an application that should never have been brought, and they should be fully compensated for those costs.

**Para 35: Declaratory Relief**

The Respondents seek declaratory relief confirming their rights and duties as directors, beneficiaries, and operators of the relevant entities. Specifically, the Respondents seek declarations that: (a) Daniel Faucitt has the right and duty to operate the Shopify platform owned by his UK company; (b) Jacqueline Faucitt has the right and duty to fulfill her role as Responsible Person for EU compliance; (c) both Respondents have the right to demand accountability from trustees and directors; and (d) the actions taken by the Respondents in exposing financial misconduct were lawful and proper.

**Para 36: Preservation of Rights**

The Respondents expressly reserve all rights to pursue further legal action, including but not limited to: (a) claims for delictual damages arising from the financial losses documented in this affidavit; (b) applications for declarations of delinquency under section 162 of the Companies Act; (c) criminal complaints for fraud, theft, and money laundering; (d) applications for the removal of trustees under the Trust Property Control Act; and (e) any other relief that may be competent and appropriate.

---

## Part H: Conclusion

**Para 37: Consolidated Legal Position**

When the evidence is reorganized chronologically and by role-responsibility, a coherent pattern emerges which directly contradicts the factual substratum presented in the ex parte application. The Applicant's founding papers suppressed material facts, misstated operational realities, inverted payment flows, concealed conflicts of interest, omitted retaliatory acts following fiduciary compliance by the Respondents, and created an artificial sense of urgency by omitting the Applicant's own role in generating the harm. These omissions are material in law and would have materially influenced the Court's exercise of its discretion. The interdict therefore constitutes an abuse of ex parte process, a retaliatory use of litigation, a misuse of corporate control, and a violation of fiduciary and trustee duties. The matter is accordingly reviewable and rescindable under the principles in *Schlesinger*, *Basson*, *Beinash*, and Rule 42(1)(a).

**Para 38: Prayer for Relief**

The Respondents respectfully pray for the following relief:

1. That the interim interdict granted on [DATE] be rescinded with immediate effect;
2. That the Applicant be ordered to pay the costs of this application on an attorney-and-client scale, or alternatively on a punitive scale;
3. That the declaratory relief set out in paragraph 35 above be granted;
4. That the Respondents' rights to pursue further legal action be expressly preserved;
5. Such further and/or alternative relief as this Honourable Court may deem just and equitable.
