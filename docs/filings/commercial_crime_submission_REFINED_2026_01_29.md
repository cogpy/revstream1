### Appendix: The 2020 Financial Manipulation Blueprint

Newly discovered trial balance evidence from 2019-2020 provides a blueprint for the financial manipulation that enabled the later fraud. This evidence is critical in establishing a long-standing pattern of behavior and proving that the 2025 events were not isolated incidents, but the culmination of a multi-year scheme.

**Key Mechanisms of Manipulation (2019-2020):**

1.  **Massive Inter-Company Debt**: Strategic Logistics (SLG) carried a **R13M debt** to RegimA Skin Treatments (RST), creating an artificial financial dependency that allowed for profit shifting through interest payments (R414K annually at a suspiciously low 3.19% rate).

2.  **Coordinated Cost Reallocations**: On February 20, 2020, multiple entities executed simultaneous journal entries to reallocate over **R1M in administrative fees** to production costs, deliberately obscuring true profitability and operational costs.

3.  **Systematic Cost Dumping**: RegimA Worldwide Distribution (RWW) was systematically used as an expense dumping ground, receiving a **R750K loan for production costs** from RST and bearing over **R1.7M in reallocated admin fees, warehouse charges, and computer expenses** for the group.

4.  **Capital Extraction via Property**: Villa Via, a property holding company, generated **R3.7M in profit** from rental income while maintaining a **R22.8M members' loan account** (5.2x its annual rental income), indicating a systematic mechanism for extracting capital from the business.

5.  **Centralized Control & Cover-up**: All entity accounts were controlled by the co-director's personal bookkeeper. The 6-month delay in finalizing the 2020 financial statements, coordinated by Danie Bantjes and signed off by Bernadine Wright, points to a complex and deliberate manipulation requiring extended time to orchestrate and conceal.

This evidence proves a clear *modus operandi* of financial deception that was in place years before the 2025 fraud was discovered. It demonstrates intent, premeditation, and a sophisticated understanding of how to exploit the inter-company structure for personal gain.


### NEW EVIDENCE: Director's Written Acknowledgment of Fraud (17 June 2025)

A letter from Director Peter Andrew Faucitt to FNB, dated 17 June 2025, serves as a direct admission of his awareness of fraudulent activities. In this letter, Mr. Faucitt:

1.  **Acknowledges "suspected fraud"** on the company's bank account (62323196362).
2.  Confirms he had made a **prior written request to cancel debit cards** due to this suspected fraud.
3.  Warns FNB that re-issuing cards could make the bank an **"accessory after the fact."**
4.  Expresses concern that the company may be **"transgressing the Exchange Control Regulations"** due to dollar-based subscription expenses.

This letter, written just 11 days after the fraud was exposed by Daniel Faucitt to the company's accountant, is irrefutable proof that the director was aware of the ongoing fraud. This directly contradicts his later court filings where he positions himself as a victim and blames others.
