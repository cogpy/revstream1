## 3. KEY EVIDENCE OF TAX & EXCHANGE CONTROL FRAUD

### The De Novo Tax Fraud (June 2025)

On **17-18 June 2025**, Rynette Farrar instructed Marisca Meyer of De Novo Business Services to create fraudulent financial statements for RegimA SA for the year **2019**. These statements were fabricated **6 years after the fact** and issued on **25 June 2025**.

- **Evidence:**
  - `2025-06-18 - Rynette & De Novo - RegimA SA Payments.pdf` (The instruction)
  - `Regima SA (Pty) Ltd - 2019 - Financial statements - SME.pdf` (The fraudulent product)
- **Significance:** This is a **direct, undeniable act of tax fraud and forgery**, involving a registered accounting firm. It was created to retroactively justify the asset stripping of RegimA SA.

### The FNB Letter Admission (17 June 2025)

In his letter to FNB, Peter Faucitt makes a direct admission:

> "I also believe that due to the amount of **dollar-based subscription expense** passing through this account our company may be **transgressing the Exchange Control Regulations**..."

- **Evidence:** `PAF_FNB_FRAUD_LETTER_2025_06_17_OCR.md` (SF10)
- **Significance:** This is a **confession** to a criminal offense, providing the SARB with direct jurisdiction.
