# NPA Tax Fraud Report - Comprehensive Evidence-Based Submission

**Case Number:** 2025-137857  
**Reporting Party:** Daniel James Faucitt  
**Date:** 2025-12-28  
**Evidence Repository:** [cogpy/ad-res-j7](https://github.com/cogpy/ad-res-j7)

## Executive Summary

This report details systematic tax fraud and evasion by Peter Andrew Faucitt (ID: 820430 5708 18 5), Rynette Farrar, and Daniel Jacobus Bantjies. The fraud involves R10.2M in under-declared revenue, falsification of financial records, and manipulation of accounting systems to mislead the South African Revenue Service (SARS).

The fraud was instrumental to a broader scheme to capture an R18.75M Ketoni Investment Holdings payout due May 2026.

**Evidence Confidence Level:** 85-90% (strong regulatory case)

## 1. Background: The R18.75M Ketoni Payout Scheme

All tax fraud must be understood within the context of the R18.75M Ketoni Investment Holdings payout scheme. Tax fraud served multiple purposes:

1. **Revenue Diversion:** Hide R10.2M in diverted revenue from SARS
2. **Debt Creation:** Manufacture debt for Daniel's company (ReZonance)
3. **Financial Manipulation:** Create artificial losses and expenses
4. **Creditor Pressure:** Force dissolution of competing entities

**Central Motive Evidence:**
- [JF10 - Trust Documents](https://github.com/cogpy/ad-res-j7/tree/main/ANNEXURES/JF10)
- [SF1 - Bantjies Appointment](https://github.com/cogpy/ad-res-j7/blob/main/ANNEXURES/SF1_Bantjies_Debt_Documentation.md)

## 2. Key Areas of Tax Fraud

### 2.1. Under-Declaration of Revenue (R10.2M)

#### 2.1.1. Revenue Hijacking Scheme

**Mechanism:** Revenue generated through Daniel's Shopify platform (regima.zone) was systematically diverted from RegimA Skin Treatments to RegimA Worldwide Distribution, likely resulting in significant under-declaration of income and VAT.

**Timeline of Revenue Diversion:**

| Date | Event | Amount Impact | Evidence |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|
| March 1, 2025 | RegimA SA diversion begins | Ongoing | JF02 |
| April 14, 2025 | Rynette bank letter for RWW diversion | Ongoing | JF05 |
| May 23, 2025 | Orders removed from Shopify | Ongoing | JF01 |
| June 20, 2025 | Email: "don't use regima.zone" | Ongoing | JF05 |
| Sept 11, 2025 | Accounts emptied | Final | JF03, JF04 |

**Total Diverted Revenue:** R10,269,727.90

**Evidence:**
- [JF02 - Shopify Sales Reports](https://github.com/cogpy/ad-res-j7/tree/main/ANNEXURES/JF02)
  - 3 comprehensive sales reports
  - Revenue tracking from regima.zone platform
  - Comparison with declared income
- [JF03 - Financial Records and Analysis](https://github.com/cogpy/ad-res-j7/tree/main/ANNEXURES/JF03)
  - 5 detailed financial analysis documents
  - Inter-company transaction records
  - Revenue diversion documentation
- [JF01 - Shopify Plus Email](https://github.com/cogpy/ad-res-j7/tree/main/ANNEXURES/JF01)
  - "Forensic Time Capsule" proving ownership
  - Platform subscription evidence
  - Revenue generation proof

**Confidence Level:** 90% (conclusive evidence of revenue diversion)

#### 2.1.2. Tax Impact Analysis

**Under-Declared Income:**
- **Amount:** R10,269,727.90
- **Tax Rate (Corporate):** 27%
- **Estimated Tax Liability:** R2,772,826.53

**Under-Declared VAT:**
- **VAT on Sales:** R10,269,727.90 × 15% = R1,540,459.19
- **Estimated VAT Liability:** R1,540,459.19 (assuming minimal input VAT offset)

**Total Estimated Tax Fraud:** R4,313,285.72

**Note:** This is a conservative estimate. Actual tax fraud may be higher when including:
- Multi-year revenue diversions (2023-2025)
- Additional entities involved (RegimA SA, Strategic Logistics)
- Transfer pricing manipulations
- Stock adjustment fraud (R5.4M)

### 2.2. Falsification of Financial Records

#### 2.2.1. Sage Accounting System Manipulation

**Violation:** Rynette Farrar systematically manipulated Sage accounting records to conceal the true financial position of multiple companies, with the intent to mislead SARS.

**Specific Acts:**

**1. Expense Dumping (March 30, 2025)**
- **Action:** Dumped 2 years of unallocated expenses into RegimA Worldwide
- **Amount:** Multiple millions (exact amount TBD from records)
- **Purpose:** Create artificial debt for Daniel's entities
- **Timeline:** 12-hour deadline imposed for Daniel to review
- **Evidence:** [SF2 - Sage Screenshots](https://github.com/cogpy/ad-res-j7/blob/main/ANNEXURES/SF2_Sage_Screenshots_Rynette_Control.md)
- **Confidence:** 90%

**2. System Control Using Peter's Email**
- **Action:** Rynette controlled Sage accounting using pete@regima.com
- **Duration:** 2+ years (2023-2025)
- **Access Level:** Full administrative control
- **Evidence:** 
  - [SF2 - Sage Screenshots](https://github.com/cogpy/ad-res-j7/blob/main/ANNEXURES/SF2_Sage_Screenshots_Rynette_Control.md)
  - Screenshots from June 20, 2025 and August 25, 2025
  - System logs showing Rynette's access patterns
- **Confidence:** 95%

**3. Transaction Manipulation**
- **Action:** Modified financial transactions, allocated expenses, controlled visibility
- **Impact:** Concealed true financial position from SARS
- **Evidence:** [JF07 - System Screenshots](https://github.com/cogpy/ad-res-j7/tree/main/ANNEXURES/JF07)
  - 186 screenshots of system manipulation
  - Transaction modification evidence
- **Confidence:** 90%

#### 2.2.2. Strategic Logistics Stock Adjustment Fraud (R5.4M)

**Violation:** R5.4M inventory adjustment at Strategic Logistics Group (SLG) used to manufacture tax losses.

**Details:**
- **Amount:** R5,400,000
- **Mechanism:** "Stock adjustment" reflecting stock that "just disappeared"
- **Stock Type:** Same type supplied by Adderory (Rynette's son's company)
- **Tax Impact:** Created R5.4M tax loss for SLG
- **Timing:** Coordinated with SARS audit

**Evidence:**
- [SF3 - Strategic Logistics Stock Adjustment](https://github.com/cogpy/ad-res-j7/blob/main/ANNEXURES/SF3_Strategic_Logistics_Stock_Adjustment.md)
  - Detailed analysis of R5.4M loss
  - 10x larger than prior year
  - 46% of annual sales
  - No corresponding write-off recovery
  - Negative R4.2M finished goods inventory (accounting fiction)
- [SF5 - Adderory Company Registration](https://github.com/cogpy/ad-res-j7/blob/main/ANNEXURES/SF5_Adderory_Company_Registration_Stock_Supply.md)
  - Rynette's son's company
  - Supplier of RegimA packaging
  - Conflict of interest documentation

**Confidence Level:** 85-90%

**Tax Fraud Mechanism:**
1. SLG sells to RegimA Skin Treatments at below cost
2. Deliberate undervaluation creates losses at SLG
3. Profits appear in other entities (controlled by Peter/Rynette)
4. R5.4M "adjustment" is difference between true cost and transfer price
5. Tax asset created for SLG while profits hidden elsewhere

#### 2.2.3. SARS Audit Manipulation

**Violation:** Bantjies instructed Rynette to make payments related to stock adjustment during SARS audit, concealing the fraud.

**Evidence:**
- [SF4 - SARS Audit Email](https://github.com/cogpy/ad-res-j7/blob/main/ANNEXURES/SF4_SARS_Audit_Email.md)
  - Email from Rynette claiming Bantjies instructed payments
  - Timing coincides with SARS audit
  - Demonstrates coordination between Bantjies and Rynette
  - Shows intent to conceal stock adjustment fraud

**Confidence Level:** 85%

### 2.3. Transfer Pricing Manipulation

#### 2.3.1. Inter-Company Transaction Fraud

**Mechanism:** Manipulated transfer prices between related entities to shift profits and create artificial losses.

**Entities Involved:**
- **Strategic Logistics Group (SLG):** Manufacturing entity, forced into losses
- **RegimA Skin Treatments (RST):** Retail entity, receives stock at below-cost prices
- **RegimA Worldwide Distribution (RWW):** Distribution entity, expense dumping ground
- **Villa Via:** Rent extraction entity (86% profit margin)

**Transfer Pricing Fraud:**
1. SLG manufactures at cost X
2. SLG sells to RST at cost X - Y (below cost)
3. SLG reports loss of Y
4. RST reports profit of Y
5. Net effect: profit shifted from SLG to RST
6. Tax benefit: SLG loss offsets other income

**Evidence:**
- [SF3 - Stock Adjustment](https://github.com/cogpy/ad-res-j7/blob/main/ANNEXURES/SF3_Strategic_Logistics_Stock_Adjustment.md)
- [JF03 - Financial Records](https://github.com/cogpy/ad-res-j7/tree/main/ANNEXURES/JF03)

**Confidence Level:** 85%
