# CIPC Companies Act Complaint - Refined 2025-12-27

**Case Number:** 2025-137857  
**Complainant:** Daniel James Faucitt  
**Date:** 2025-12-27

## 1. Introduction

This complaint details gross violations of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 by Peter Andrew Faucitt, a director of multiple entities, and his co-conspirators. The evidence demonstrates a systematic scheme to defraud the Faucitt Family Trust (IT 003651/2013) and its beneficiaries, centered on the illicit capture of an R18.75M payout from Ketoni Investment Holdings (Pty) Ltd.

## 2. Central Motive: The R18.75M Ketoni Payout

The entire fraudulent scheme is predicated on the R18.75M payout due to the Faucitt Family Trust in May 2026. Peter Faucitt, as a 50% beneficiary, is entitled to R9.375M. His actions are designed to unlawfully seize the remaining R9.375M from his co-beneficiary, Jacqueline Faucitt, through a manufactured curatorship.
