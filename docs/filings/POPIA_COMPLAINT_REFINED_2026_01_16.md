## 4. Detailed Allegations

### 4.1. Unauthorized Processing of Personal Information

Rynette Farrar gained unauthorized access to the Sage accounting system and email accounts, allowing her to process personal and financial information without consent.

*   **SF2 - Sage Screenshots:** Show Rynette Farrar with access to `Pete@regima.com` user account on 2020-08-15, proving unauthorized system control.
*   **SF7 - Court Order for Email Seizure:** A court order was required to seize Kayla Pretorius's email account after her death, which was being accessed without authorization.

### 4.2. Failure to Secure Personal Information

The perpetrators failed to implement adequate security measures, leading to multiple data breaches.

*   The seizure of email accounts and unauthorized access to the accounting system demonstrate a clear failure to protect personal information.
*   No notification of these breaches was provided to the data subjects, a direct violation of Section 22 of POPIA.

### 4.3. Identity Fraud

Personal information was used to commit identity fraud.

*   **Domain Registration:** The domain `regim-a.com` was fraudulently registered in the name of Rynette Farrar's son, using his personal information without his knowledge or consent to perpetrate the fraud (Evidence: JF08, JF09).
*   **Email Impersonation:** Rynette Farrar impersonated Peter Faucitt by using his email account to communicate with distributors and redirect payments.

## 5. Evidence Summary

*   **SF2 - Sage Screenshots:** Conclusive proof of unauthorized system access.
*   **SF7 - Court Order:** Demonstrates the need for legal intervention to stop unauthorized data access.
*   **JF08 - Comprehensive Fraud Evidence:** Contains evidence of email impersonation and domain registration fraud.

## 6. Conclusion and Requested Action

We request that the Information Regulator investigate these serious violations of POPIA and take appropriate enforcement action, including:

1.  Issuing an enforcement notice against the responsible parties.
2.  Imposing a fine for the violations.
3.  Referring the matter for criminal prosecution for the identity fraud and other criminal acts.
