## 2. The Core Crime: Torture Through Protracted Abuse

### 2.1. Legal Definition of Torture

**Prevention and Combating of Torture of Persons Act 13 of 2013, s 3:**

> "Torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as—
> (a) obtaining information or a confession from that person or a third person;
> (b) punishing that person for an act that person or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed;
> (c) intimidating or coercing that person or a third person; or
> (d) for any reason based on discrimination of any kind."

### 2.2. Application to Jacqueline Faucitt

**Element 1: Severe Pain or Suffering (Physical and Mental)**

The Complainant was subjected to:
- **Financial strangulation** (bank account freezes)
- **Professional annihilation** (CEO removal from her own company)
- **Bodily autonomy violation** (forced medical experiments)
- **Social isolation** (communication bans)
- **Psychological torture** (weaponization of her suffering)

**Element 2: Intentionally Inflicted**

Peter Andrew Faucitt **knew** the "R500k birthday gift" claim was false because:
- He had Daniel Faucitt's bank statements showing the R500k came from Strategic Logistics (Daniel's own company), not Jacqueline
- He had the bank statements showing R1.06M in business expenses with clear transaction descriptions
- He deliberately concealed this evidence from the Court

**Element 3: Purpose - Punishing**

The torture was inflicted to **punish** Jacqueline for:
- Investigating accounting fraud (fabricated financial statements for RegimA SA)
- Demanding oversight of financial systems controlled by Rynette Farrar Bantjies
- Filing fraud reports with SAPS

**Element 4: Purpose - Intimidating/Coercing**

The torture was inflicted to **intimidate and coerce** Jacqueline into:
- Ceasing her investigation of financial misconduct
- Accepting Peter's and Rynette's control over the companies
- Abandoning her directorial duties and oversight responsibilities

**Conclusion:** All elements of torture are satisfied.

---

## 3. The Mechanism: Weaponization of the Legal System

### 3.1. The False Foundation

**Charge: Perjury (Criminal Procedure Act, s 319)**

Peter Andrew Faucitt made a **false statement under oath** in the founding affidavit for the ex parte interdict (August 13, 2025):

> "I believe Jacqueline took an 'I'll show you' position and gave Daniel the R500k as a birthday gift."

**Proof of Falsehood:**

Daniel Faucitt's bank statements (May-October 2025) prove:
- The R500k came from **Strategic Logistics** (Daniel's own company), not Jacqueline
- It was **reimbursement** for R1.06M in company expenses
- Daniel funded R597k from his **own investment account**
- The transaction descriptions show **business expenses** (Shopify, software, cloud services), not personal spending

**Proof of Knowledge:**

Peter had these bank statements at the time he made the false statement, proving he **knew it was false**.

**Consequence:**

This false statement was the **foundation** for all subsequent abuse.

---

### 3.2. The Cascade of Consequences

**Charge: Torture (Prevention and Combating of Torture of Persons Act, s 3)**

Based on the false "R500k birthday gift" claim, Peter obtained court orders that:

1. **Froze Jacqueline's bank accounts** (financial strangulation)
2. **Removed her as CEO** from her own company (professional annihilation)
3. **Subjected her to forced medical experiments** (bodily autonomy violation)
4. **Prohibited her from communicating** with staff, clients, suppliers (social isolation)
5. **Weaponized her expressions of suffering** as "evidence" of mental illness (psychological torture)

Each consequence was justified by the previous one, creating a **self-perpetuating cycle of abuse**.

---

## 4. The Pattern: Three Sequential Interdicts

**Charge: Abuse of Court Process (Common law)**

Peter filed **three sequential interdict applications** in three months:

| Application | Date | Target | Basis | Outcome |
|-------------|------|--------|-------|---------|
| **1st (Ex Parte)** | Aug 13, 2025 | Both | False "R500k birthday gift" claim | Granted |
| **2nd (Settlement)** | Oct 2025 | Both | Alleged breach of settlement | Opposed |
| **3rd (Contact Ban)** | Nov 4, 2025 | Jacqueline only | Jacqueline's suffering used as "evidence" | Pending |

**Pattern:**

Each application was filed in retaliation for Jacqueline or Daniel exercising legitimate rights:
- **1st:** Filed 2 days after Daniel signed trustee document
- **2nd:** Filed ~7-14 days after withdrawal from mediation
- **3rd:** Filed after Jacqueline demanded salary and oversight

**Conclusion:**

This is **lawfare**—the weaponization of legal systems to inflict harm.

---

## 5. The Co-Conspirator: Rynette Farrar Bantjies

**Charge: Conspiracy to commit torture + Fraud**

Rynette Farrar Bantjies:
- **Fabricated financial statements** for RegimA SA (2019-2021) when the company was called K-Oz Creative
- **Instructed accountants to remove** Daniel's QuickBooks records (destruction of evidence)
- **Controlled financial systems** to conceal revenue theft and trust violations
- **Conspired with Peter** to use the legal system to silence Jacqueline's investigation

**Evidence:**

De Novo correspondence (Annexure AF10 from Peter's own papers) shows Rynette instructing accountants to fabricate accounts and remove Daniel's records.

---

## 6. The Harm: Quantification of Damages

### 6.1. Financial Harm

| Item | Amount | Basis |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Loss of CEO salary** (33 years) | R10M+ | Estimated value of CEO position |
| **Loss of business value** | R50M+ | Estimated value of company built over 33 years |
| **Legal costs** | R1M+ | Defending against three sequential interdicts |
| **Total Financial Harm** | **R61M+** | Conservative estimate |

### 6.2. Non-Financial Harm

- **Psychological trauma** (PTSD, anxiety, depression)
- **Loss of dignity** (forced medical experiments, public humiliation)
- **Loss of reputation** (false allegations of mental illness)
- **Loss of professional identity** (CEO removal)
- **Loss of social connections** (communication bans)

**Quantification:** Immeasurable, but recognized by courts as warranting substantial damages.
