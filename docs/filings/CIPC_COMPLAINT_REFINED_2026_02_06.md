# CIPC COMPANIES ACT COMPLAINT (REFINED)

**Case Reference:** 2025-137857-CIPC  
**Date:** 2026-02-06  
**Version:** Refined (incorporates evidence up to 2026-02-06)

**Burden of Proof Standard:** Balance of Probabilities (50%+) - **EXCEEDED**  
**Criminal Threshold:** Beyond Reasonable Doubt (95%+) - **EXCEEDED**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This refined complaint details systematic and conclusive breaches of the Companies Act, No. 71 of 2008, by Director Peter Andrew Faucitt and his co-conspirators. It integrates all evidence gathered, including critical corrections from **February 2026**, establishing a clear pattern of fiduciary breach, reckless trading, fraud, and oppression.

**CRITICAL CORRECTION:** The central financial motive has been corrected. **Ketoni Investment Holdings owes R18.685M to the Faucitt Family Trust**, not a personal debt involving Bantjies. This is more damning, as it places Trustee **Danie Bantjies** in a position of **controlling both ends of the transaction** through his connection to Ketoni's director, creating **six distinct conflicts of interest**.

Key evidence includes the **Shopify centrality organogram** (proving premeditation), **fabricated 2019 financial statements** (tax fraud), bank statements showing **99.8% asset stripping**, Peter Faucitt's own **FNB Fraud Letter** (direct admission of fraud awareness), and **Sage accounting records** proving Rynette Farrar's identity fraud and system control. The evidence presented meets and exceeds the standards for both civil and criminal liability, mandating a Section 162 Director Disqualification application.

## 2. CENTRAL FINANCIAL MOTIVE: Ketoni R18.685M Payout

### 2.1 Corrected Debt Structure

A **ZAR 18.685 million payout** from **Ketoni Investment Holdings (ORG_017)**, due to the **Faucitt Family Trust (TRUST_001)** in **May 2026**, is the central motive for the entire criminal enterprise. All fraudulent acts were strategically timed to neutralize beneficiaries and seize control of this asset.

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Debtor** | Ketoni Investment Holdings (Pty) Ltd |
| **Creditor** | Faucitt Family Trust |
| **Investment** | FFT holds 5,000 A-Ordinary shares (Certificate #3) |
| **Payout Date** | May 2026 |
| **Total Payout** | ZAR 18.685M |

### 2.2 Bantjies' Dual Control Loop

This corrected structure places Trustee Danie Bantjies in a position of **unprecedented control over both ends of the transaction**:

```
KETONI INVESTMENT HOLDINGS (ORG_017)
           │
           │ Owes R18.685M (Call Option)
           │
           │ ← Bantjies has INSIDER ACCESS via Kevin Derrick (Director)
           ▼
    FAUCITT FAMILY TRUST (TRUST_001)
           │
           │ ← Bantjies CONTROLS as Trustee
           ▼
    BENEFICIARIES (Peter, Jacqui, Daniel)
           │
           │ ← Bantjies CONTROLS DISTRIBUTION
```

This dual control is the foundation for charges of **insider trading** and **self-dealing** against Bantjies.

## 3. SIX CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: DANIE BANTJIES

We submit that Danie Bantjies has acted in a manner that is grossly negligent and constitutes a breach of trust by operating under six distinct and irreconcilable conflicts of interest:

| # | Conflict | Description | Evidence |
|---|----------|-------------|----------|
| **1** | **Commissioner of Oaths** | Swore his own false affidavit in support of the interdict | Court records |
| **2** | **Trustee of FFT** | Has a fiduciary duty to the very beneficiaries he helped neutralize | FFT appointment docs |
| **3** | **Affidavit Witness** | Provided perjured supporting testimony against a beneficiary | Interdict application |
| **4** | **CFO of George Group** | Employer of Kevin Derrick, Director of Ketoni | Employment records |
| **5** | **Insider Access to Ketoni** | Through his professional relationship with Kevin Derrick | Corporate records |
| **6** | **Controls Distribution** | As Trustee, he decides how the R18.685M is distributed | Trust deed |
