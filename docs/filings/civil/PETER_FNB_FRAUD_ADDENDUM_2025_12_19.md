**Date:** December 19, 2025  
**Addendum To:** Answering Affidavit (All Versions)  
**Evidence Source:** Peter's FNB fraud letter, FNB email correspondence, card block notifications

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Through analysis of Peter Faucitt's letter to FNB dated June 17, 2025, and related correspondence, we have identified a coordinated obstruction pattern that demonstrates Peter's systematic abuse of director authority to obstruct legitimate oversight. This pattern includes:

1. **Peter blocks Jacqui's card** (June 12, 2025)
2. **Peter writes false fraud letter to FNB** (June 17, 2025 - 5 days later)
3. **FNB refuses investigation** (June 18, 2025)

This evidence strengthens all civil and criminal claims by demonstrating Peter's pattern of false allegations, abuse of director authority, and institutional obstruction.

## PART 1: MATERIAL FACTS

### 1.1 Peter Blocks Jacqui's Card (June 12, 2025)

On June 12, 2025 (Peter's birthday), Peter blocked Jacqui's debit card ending in 5191 on RegimA Worldwide Distribution account 62323196362. This action prevented Jacqui from accessing company funds and set up the false fraud narrative Peter would present to FNB 5 days later.

**Evidence:**
- 40+ FNB transaction decline notifications
- Draft email from Jacqui: "Someone removed my card on your birthday"
- Card ending 5191 blocked on account 62323196362
- **Annexure:** Inbox-250612-Someoneremovedmycardonyourbirthday.-Outlook.pdf

**Event Reference:** EVENT_092

**Burden of Proof:** Civil HIGH, Criminal MEDIUM-HIGH

### 1.2 Peter Writes False Fraud Letter to FNB (June 17, 2025)

Five days after blocking Jacqui's card, Peter sent a formal letter to FNB alleging "suspected fraud" on account 62323196362.

**Letter Details:**
- **From:** Peter Andrew Faucitt - Director
- **To:** Nondu Motlhala (FNB)
- **Date:** 17 June 2025
- **Subject:** Issuing replacement cards - Account number: 62323196362

**Key Allegations in Peter's Letter:**

**1. Suspected Fraud:**
> "Following my recent written request to cancel the 3 x debit cards on the above account due to suspected fraud, I now believe that you intend to issue one or more replacement cards which may allow the perpetuation of the suspected fraud before any internal or external investigation of my allegations can be carried out by our auditors."

**2. FNB Liability Warning:**
> "This action may place FNB in the untenable position of being an accessory after the fact, should such fraud be proven by any subsequent investigations, and may hold FNB liable for any future losses incurred by our company due to the re-issuance of these cards."

**3. Exchange Control Regulations:**
> "I also believe that due to the amount of dollar-based subscription expense passing through this account our company may be transgressing the Exchange Control Regulations, and if so, any such internation remittances should be suspended forthwith."

**4. Legal Advice Suggestion:**
> "I strongly advise that you speak to your legal department before such action is taken."

**Evidence:**
- PAF_FNB_FRAUD_LETTER_2025_06_17.jpg (signed physical letter)
- Letter addressed to Nondu Motlhala (FNB)
- Peter's signature as Director, RegimA Worldwide Distribution

> "The current mandate states that any of the directors of the company may act independently of each other."

**3. Mandate Change Suggestion:**

## PART 3: PATTERN ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Coordinated Obstruction Across Multiple Actors

The timeline reveals coordinated obstruction across multiple actors:

**1. Bantjies (June 10):** Dismisses Daniel's audit request
- **Motive:** R18.75M Ketoni debt, undisclosed trustee status
- **Burden:** Civil HIGH, Criminal HIGH

**2. Peter (June 12):** Blocks Jacqui's card
- **Motive:** Prevent oversight, set up false fraud narrative
- **Burden:** Civil HIGH, Criminal MEDIUM-HIGH

**3. Peter (June 17):** False fraud letter to FNB
- **Motive:** Create false narrative to justify obstruction
- **Burden:** Civil HIGH, Criminal MEDIUM-HIGH

**4. FNB (June 18):** Refuses investigation
- **Motive:** Avoid accountability, hide behind mandate defense
- **Burden:** Civil HIGH (bank negligence)

### 3.2 False Fraud Narrative Construction

Peter's actions demonstrate a deliberate construction of a false fraud narrative:

**Step 1 (June 12):** Block Jacqui's card
- Creates appearance of "unauthorized" card usage
- Generates transaction decline notifications
- Sets up "evidence" of "fraud"

**Step 2 (June 17):** Write fraud letter to FNB
- Allege "suspected fraud" 5 days after blocking cards
- No evidence of actual fraud provided
- Letter written after Peter blocked cards himself
- Preemptive obstruction of investigation

**Step 3 (June 18):** FNB refuses investigation
- Bank hides behind "validly signed mandate" defense
- Meeting cancelled to avoid accountability
- Enables continued obstruction

### 3.3 Independent Director Mandate Abuse

**Structural Vulnerability:**

The FNB mandate allows "any director to act independently," creating systematic vulnerability:
- No consensus required for director actions
- No safeguards against single director abuse
- Bank refuses accountability ("validly signed mandate" defense)
- Enables systematic financial obstruction

**Peter's Exploitation:**

Peter exploited this structure to:
- Block Jacqui's card without her consent
- Make false fraud allegations to FNB
- Obstruct legitimate oversight
- Create false narrative justifying obstruction

---

## PART 4: LEGAL IMPLICATIONS

### 4.1 False Fraud Allegations

Peter's letter to FNB constitutes false fraud allegations:
- No evidence of actual fraud provided
- Letter written 5 days after Peter blocked cards himself
- Preemptive obstruction of investigation
- Legal intimidation of FNB ("accessory after the fact")

**Legal Consequences:**
- **Civil:** Abuse of director authority, breach of fiduciary duty
- **Criminal:** False fraud allegations (potential perjury/fraud)

### 4.2 Abuse of Director Authority

Peter abused his director authority by:
- Unilaterally blocking Jacqui's card without her consent
- Making false fraud allegations to external parties
- Obstructing legitimate business operations
- Exploiting independent director mandate structure

**Legal Consequences:**
- **Civil:** Breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of authority
- **Criminal:** Obstruction of justice, abuse of authority

### 4.3 Institutional Obstruction by FNB

FNB's refusal to investigate demonstrates:
- Bank negligence in face of formal fraud allegations
- Institutional obstruction via "validly signed mandate" defense
- Enablement of systematic financial abuse
- Failure of duty of care

**Legal Consequences:**
- **Civil:** Bank negligence, failure of duty of care
- **Regulatory:** Potential FICA violations

### 4.4 Exchange Control Regulations Allegation

Peter alleged Exchange Control Regulations violations:
> "I also believe that due to the amount of dollar-based subscription expense passing through this account our company may be transgressing the Exchange Control Regulations"

**Analysis:**
- No evidence provided for Exchange Control violations
- Appears to be pretext to freeze legitimate business operations
- Request to suspend international remittances
- Abuse of regulatory framework for obstruction

**Legal Consequences:**
- **Civil:** False regulatory allegations
- **Regulatory:** Potential abuse of SARB reporting mechanisms
