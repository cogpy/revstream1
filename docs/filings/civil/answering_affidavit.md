## Executive Summary

This answering affidavit serves as a comprehensive, evidence-based refutation of the Applicant's claims. It will demonstrate, through irrefutable and verifiable evidence, that the Applicant's narrative is not only false but is designed to conceal a systematic campaign of fraud, revenue hijacking, and trust manipulation. The evidence presented herein exceeds both the civil and criminal burdens of proof, and it points to a coordinated conspiracy to defraud the Respondents and the Faucitt Family Trust.

### Core Tenets of the Defense

1.  **The Applicant's Case is Built on a Foundation of Lies:** The central claims of the Applicant are directly contradicted by contemporaneous, third-party evidence.
2.  **A Pattern of Malicious Conduct:** The Applicant and his co-conspirators have engaged in a multi-year scheme of financial misconduct, evidence tampering, and legal abuse.
3.  **The Evidence is Conclusive:** The case is supported by a wealth of evidence, including system-generated logs, financial records, and official documents, which, when taken together, paint a damning picture of the Applicant's actions.

## Part 1: The Irrefutable Evidence - The Cornerstones of the Case

This section presents the three most critical pieces of evidence that, on their own, are sufficient to dismantle the Applicant's case and reveal the fraudulent nature of his claims.

### 1.1. The "Forensic Time Capsule" - JF01: The Shopify Plus Email

*   **Evidence:** JF01 - Shopify Plus Onboarding Email (26 July 2017)
*   **Significance:** This email from a neutral third party (Shopify) irrefutably proves that the Respondents' business operations were established and managed independently, long before the Applicant's fabricated timeline. It is a digital time capsule that cannot be altered or disputed.

### 1.2. The "Smoking Gun" - SF2: The Sage Accounting System Control

*   **Evidence:** SF2 - Sage Accounting System Screenshots (20 June 2025)
*   **Significance:** These screenshots provide conclusive, system-generated proof that Rynette Farrar, a co-conspirator, had unauthorized access to the accounting system using the Applicant's credentials. This demonstrates a clear mechanism for financial manipulation and impersonation.

### 1.3. The "Trigger Event" - SF6: The Kayla Pretorius Estate

*   **Evidence:** SF6 - Kayla Pretorius Estate Documentation
*   **Significance:** The death of Kayla Pretorius on 22 May 2025 served as the catalyst for the escalation of the Applicant's fraudulent activities. The evidence shows a direct temporal correlation between her death and the initiation of the revenue hijacking scheme.

*   **(To be populated with a detailed legal analysis, citing relevant statutes and case law)**

## Part 5: Prayer for Relief

Given the overwhelming weight of the evidence, the Respondents respectfully request the following relief:

1.  **Dismissal of the Applicant's Application:** The application should be dismissed in its entirety, with costs awarded to the Respondents on an attorney-client scale.
2.  **Referral for Criminal Prosecution:** The matter should be referred to the National Prosecuting Authority for a full criminal investigation into the Applicant and his co-conspirators for fraud, perjury, and other related offenses.
3.  **Referral to Regulatory Bodies:** The matter should be referred to the CIPC and the Information Regulator for investigation into breaches of the Companies Act and POPIA, respectively.
