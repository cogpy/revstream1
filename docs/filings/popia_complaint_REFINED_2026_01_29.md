## Central Financial Motive: The ZAR 18.75M Ketoni Payout

A critical development in this case is the discovery of a **ZAR 18.75 million payout** from Ketoni Investment Holdings, due to the Faucitt Family Trust in May 2026. This substantial financial incentive provides a clear and compelling motive for the actions of the primary perpetrators, **Peter Andrew Faucitt (PERSON_001)**, the primary perpetrator.
**Evidence:**
- JF01 - Shopify Plus email evidence
- JF04 - CIPC company records
- JF07 - Financial transaction records
- JF08 - Email correspondence and fraud evidence
- JF09 - Court order timeline cross-reference
- SF9 - Ian Levitt R63M demand letter
**Ad-Res-J7 Cross-References:**
- `ANNEXURES/JF01 - Shopify Plus email showing business structure`
- `ANNEXURES/JF04 - CIPC company registration documents`
- `ANNEXURES/JF06 - Court applications and filings`
- `ANNEXURES/JF08/evidence_package_20251012 - Comprehensive fraud timeline`

- `KETONI_PAYOUT_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY_V48-49.md - Central financial motive`
- `evidence/FFT_KETONI_INVESTMENT_TIMELINE_V49.md - Comprehensive timeline`
 and Rynette Farrar. All fraudulent activities, from the manipulation of trust structures to the neutralization of beneficiaries, can be understood as a coordinated effort to seize control of this significant asset.

**Key Implications:**
- **Strategic Timing:** All major fraudulent events occurred between T-9 and T-11 months before the May 2026 payout date, indicating a deliberate and premeditated scheme.
- **Control Consolidation:** The appointment of a complicit trustee (Daniel Bantjies) and the legal neutralization of legitimate beneficiaries (Jacqueline and Daniel Faucitt) were essential steps to ensure unfettered access to the payout.
- **Escalation of Fraud:** The perpetrators' actions escalated in direct proportion to the proximity of the payout date, demonstrating a clear causal link between the motive and the crimes.

### NEW EVIDENCE: Director's Written Acknowledgment of Fraud (17 June 2025)

A letter from Director Peter Andrew Faucitt to FNB, dated 17 June 2025, serves as a direct admission of his awareness of fraudulent activities. In this letter, Mr. Faucitt:

1.  **Acknowledges "suspected fraud"** on the company's bank account (62323196362).
2.  Confirms he had made a **prior written request to cancel debit cards** due to this suspected fraud.
3.  Warns FNB that re-issuing cards could make the bank an **"accessory after the fact."**
4.  Expresses concern that the company may be **"transgressing the Exchange Control Regulations"** due to dollar-based subscription expenses.

This letter, written just 11 days after the fraud was exposed by Daniel Faucitt to the company's accountant, is irrefutable proof that the director was aware of the ongoing fraud. This directly contradicts his later court filings where he positions himself as a victim and blames others.
