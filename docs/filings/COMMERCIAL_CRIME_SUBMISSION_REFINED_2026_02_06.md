# COMMERCIAL CRIME SUBMISSION (SAPS) (REFINED)

**Case Reference:** 2025-137857-SAPS  
**Date:** 2026-02-06  
**Version:** Refined (incorporates evidence up to 2026-02-06)

**Burden of Proof Standard:** Beyond Reasonable Doubt (95%+) - **EXCEEDED**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This refined submission details a complex, multi-year commercial crime syndicate responsible for over **R10.2M in direct fraud and theft**, with a total quantum exceeding **R63M**. It integrates all evidence, including critical findings from **February 2026**, proving a criminal conspiracy led by Peter Andrew Faucitt, Rynette Farrar, and Daniel Jacobus Bantjies.

**CRITICAL CORRECTION:** The central financial motive has been corrected. **Ketoni Investment Holdings owes R18.685M to the Faucitt Family Trust**. This provides a clear, powerful motive for the crimes and introduces new charges of **insider trading** and **self-dealing** against Trustee Danie Bantjies, who has insider access to both ends of the transaction.

Conclusive evidence, including **direct admissions of fraud awareness (SF10)**, **proof of identity fraud (SF10)**, **fabricated financial records**, and a **clear money laundering trail (8 ABSA accounts)**, meets the 95% criminal burden of proof. The submission establishes *prima facie* cases for Fraud, Theft, Forgery, Money Laundering (POCA), Insider Trading, and computer-related crimes (ECTA), warranting immediate investigation by the SAPS Commercial Crime Unit.

## 2. CENTRAL FINANCIAL MOTIVE: Ketoni R18.685M Payout

The **R18.685M payout** from Ketoni Investment Holdings to the Faucitt Family Trust (due May 2026) is the motive for the crimes. The scheme was designed to:

1.  **Bankrupt** the legitimate companies to create a false narrative of distress.
2.  **Neutralize** beneficiaries (Jacqui, Daniel) via a fraudulent interdict.
3.  **Seize control** of the Trust and its impending R18.685M payout.
