# COMMERCIAL CRIME SUBMISSION (SAPS) (REFINED)

**Case Reference:** 2025-137857-SAPS  
**Date:** 2026-02-06  
**Version:** Refined (incorporates evidence up to 2026-02-06)

**Burden of Proof Standard:** Beyond Reasonable Doubt (95%+) - **EXCEEDED**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This refined submission details a complex, multi-year commercial crime syndicate responsible for over **R10.2M in direct fraud and theft**, with a total quantum exceeding **R63M**. It integrates all evidence, including critical findings from **February 2026**, proving a criminal conspiracy led by Peter Andrew Faucitt, Rynette Farrar, and Daniel Jacobus Bantjies.

**CRITICAL CORRECTION:** The central financial motive has been corrected. **Ketoni Investment Holdings owes R18.685M to the Faucitt Family Trust**. This provides a clear, powerful motive for the crimes and introduces new charges of **insider trading** and **self-dealing** against Trustee Danie Bantjies, who has insider access to both ends of the transaction.

**NEW EVIDENCE (SF15):** Rynette Farrar has filed a perjury complaint against Jacqueline Faucitt. An evidence matrix has been prepared (**SF15**) which proves that all allegations made against Rynette are true, and that her complaint constitutes a **false criminal report** and an attempt at **obstruction of justice**.

Conclusive evidence, including **direct admissions of fraud awareness (SF10)**, **proof of identity fraud (SF10)**, and **fabricated financial records**, meets the 95% criminal burden of proof. The submission establishes *prima facie* cases for Fraud, Theft, Forgery, Money Laundering (POCA), Insider Trading, Obstruction of Justice, and computer-related crimes (ECTA), warranting immediate investigation by the SAPS Commercial Crime Unit.
