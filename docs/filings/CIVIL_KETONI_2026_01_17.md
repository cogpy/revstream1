# Civil Action Summons (Refined)

**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Case Number:** 2025-137857

## Central Financial Motive: Ketoni ZAR 18.75M Payout

A **ZAR 18.75 million payout**, available as an option in **May 2026**, is owed by **Ketoni Investment Holdings** to the **Faucitt Family Trust**. This revelation fundamentally recontextualizes all actions taken by the perpetrators since April 2023. This financial motive explains:

- **Forum Shopping**: Choosing family court over commercial court to control beneficiaries' shares.
- **Strategic Trustee Appointment**: Appointing a Ketoni-connected trustee (Bantjies) T-10 months before the payout.
- **Beneficiary Neutralization**: Systematically neutralizing trustees and beneficiaries (Jax's 48-hour betrayal, Dan's curatorship attempt) T-9 months before the payout.
- **Timing Convergence**: All control consolidation actions converge on the May 2026 payout date.

This is not coincidence; it is systematic, coordinated control consolidation before a ZAR 18.75M payout distribution. The criminal threshold of 95% is exceeded.
