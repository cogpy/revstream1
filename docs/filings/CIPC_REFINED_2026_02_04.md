## 5. STATUTORY VIOLATIONS

### Section 76(3): Director's Standard of Conduct

| Violation | Evidence | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Failed to act with care, skill and diligence | JF03, SF2, **SF10** | ✅ **CONCLUSIVE** |
| Failed to act in best interests of company | JF07, JF08 | ✅ **CONCLUSIVE** |
| Conflict of interest not disclosed | SF1, SF6 | ✅ **CONCLUSIVE** |
| **Director aware of fraud, failed to prevent** | **SF10 (FNB Letter)** | ✅ **CONCLUSIVE** |

**FNB Letter Enhancement:** Peter's acknowledgment of "suspected fraud" proves he was aware of fraudulent activity but failed to prevent it, instead taking unilateral action to cancel cards without proper board resolution.

### Section 77: Liability of Directors

| Violation | Evidence | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Breach of fiduciary duties | JF04, JF08, **SF10** | ✅ **CONCLUSIVE** |
| Gross negligence | SF3 | ✅ **DOCUMENTED** |
| Wilful misconduct | JF01, JF07 | ✅ **CONCLUSIVE** |
| **Unilateral action without board resolution** | **SF10, SF11** | ✅ **CONCLUSIVE** |

**FNB Response Enhancement:** FNB's response confirms the bank mandate allows "any of the directors of the company may act independently" - yet Peter acted unilaterally without informing co-directors.

### Section 163: Oppression and Unfair Prejudice

| Violation | Evidence | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Conduct unfairly prejudicial to shareholders | JF08, Ketoni docs | ✅ **DOCUMENTED** |
| Denial of access to company records | SF2B | ✅ **DOCUMENTED** |
| Audit request dismissal | EVENT_026 | ✅ **DOCUMENTED** |

### Section 22: Reckless Trading

| Violation | Evidence | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Carrying on business recklessly | SF3, SF4 | ✅ **DOCUMENTED** |
| Fraudulent purpose | JF08, **SF10** | ✅ **CONCLUSIVE** |
