## 1. Nature of Complaint: Revenue Stream Hijacking & Company Destruction

This submission outlines a multi-faceted commercial crime scheme resulting in the complete financial destruction of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (Reg. No. 2017/087935/07). The scheme, orchestrated by director Peter Faucitt and his associate Rynette Farrar, involved asset stripping, revenue diversion, and accounting fraud, culminating in losses exceeding R8.5 million annually.

## 2. Modus Operandi

The crime was executed in three phases:

**Phase 1: Asset Stripping (Oct 2024 - Mar 2025)**
- The company's bank account was systematically drained from a healthy **R2.5 million** to just **R5,284** through a series of large, unexplained outbound transfers.
- **Evidence:** FNB Bank Statements (*62707308252 2024-10-07.pdf* vs. *62707308252 2025-03-06.pdf*)

**Phase 2: Revenue Diversion (May 2025 onwards)**
- The company's entire Shopify revenue stream, worth R8.5M annually, was hijacked. Revenue dropped to zero from June 2025 onwards.
- This was a premeditated act, occurring 40 days after Rynette Farrar created an organogram for Peter Faucitt detailing Shopify's central importance.
- **Evidence:** Shopify Sales Report (*RegimA SA Shopify Plus - Total sales over time.pdf*), Organogram (*Power point - how sales work.pdf*)

**Phase 3: Fraudulent Cover-Up (June 2025)**
- To conceal the theft, the perpetrators engaged in accounting fraud, instructing their accountants (De Novo Business Services) to create false loan accounts and fabricating financial statements for 2019 six years after the fact.
- **Evidence:** Email Instructions (*2025-06-18 - Rynette & De Novo...pdf*), Fabricated Statements (*Regima SA (Pty) Ltd - 2019...pdf*)

## 3. Key Criminal Acts

1.  **Theft:** Diversion of the R8.5M annual revenue stream.
2.  **Fraud:** Creation of backdated financial statements and false loan accounts to deceive SARS and auditors.
3.  **Conspiracy:** Coordinated actions between Peter Faucitt, Rynette Farrar, and De Novo Business Services.
4.  **Uttering:** Presenting fraudulent financial documents as genuine.

## 4. Conclusion

This was not a business failure; it was the deliberate and criminal destruction of a company from within by one of its own directors. The evidence is documentary, comprehensive, and demonstrates a clear timeline of intent, execution, and cover-up. We request the Commercial Crime Unit to open a formal investigation into these serious economic crimes.
