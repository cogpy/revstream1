## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This refined complaint details systematic and willful violations of the Protection of Personal Information Act, 2013 (POPIA), by Peter Andrew Faucitt (Responsible Party) and Rynette Farrar (Operator). It integrates all evidence, including critical findings from **February 2026**, proving a criminal conspiracy to unlawfully process personal information to facilitate an R8.5M+ revenue hijacking scheme, motivated by the ZAR 18.685M Ketoni payout.

Conclusive evidence, including **Sage dual-account screenshots (SF10)** proving identity fraud, the **Sage subscription lockout (SF11)** proving obstruction, the **POPIA Violation Notice of 8 Jul 2025**, and Peter Faucitt's **FNB Fraud Letter (SF10)**, meets the criminal burden of proof for offenses under Section 107 of POPIA. The actions demonstrate a deliberate abuse of personal information, identity fraud, and obstruction of data subject rights, warranting immediate criminal prosecution.

## 2. CRIMINAL OFFENSES UNDER POPIA SECTION 107

### Section 107(1): Unlawful Processing & Identity Fraud

**Offense:** Knowingly or recklessly obtaining, disclosing, or procuring the disclosure of personal information without authority.

**Evidence:**

- **SF10 (2025-06-20):** Rynette Farrar's dual account access in Sage (**pete@regima.com** vs rynette@regima.zone), proving **identity fraud** to unlawfully process financial data under the guise of Peter Faucitt's identity.
- **SF7:** Court order for Kayla Pretorius email account seizure, leading to unauthorized access to personal information.
- **EVENT_014 (2025-06-20):** Email impersonation pattern and domain switch instruction to divert customer data.
- **SF10 (FNB Letter):** Confirms Rynette's operational control and processing of data under the guise of "suspected fraud."
- **POPIA Violation Notice (8 Jul 2025):** Formal notice of customer data breach sent to Peter Faucitt, which was ignored.

**Burden of Proof:** ✅ **EXCEEDED** (System logs, screenshots, director's admission, formal notice)

### Section 107(2): Obstruction of Access to Personal Information

**Offense:** Obstructing the Information Regulator or a data subject in the exercise of their rights.

**Evidence:**

- **SF11 (2025-08-25):** Sage subscription expired on **23/07/2025**. Rynette Farrar is the subscription owner and deliberately allowed the system to expire, **denying all parties access to their personal and financial information** for over a month, just before the interdict was filed. This is a direct obstruction of the data subjects' right to access their information under Section 23.
- **EVENT_027 (2025-06-20):** Domain switch email instruction to divert customer data to a fraudulent domain, obstructing customers' access to their own data on the legitimate platform.

**Burden of Proof:** ✅ **EXCEEDED** (System logs, email evidence, timeline corroboration)
