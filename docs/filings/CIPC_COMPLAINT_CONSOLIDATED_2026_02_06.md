## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This consolidated complaint details systematic and conclusive breaches of the Companies Act, No. 71 of 2008, by Director Peter Andrew Faucitt and his co-conspirators. It integrates all evidence gathered across 39 historical versions, establishing a clear pattern of fiduciary breach, reckless trading, fraud, and oppression, motivated by the impending ZAR 18.75M Ketoni payout. 

Critical evidence includes the **Shopify centrality organogram** (proving premeditation), **fabricated 2019 financial statements** (tax fraud), bank statements showing **99.8% asset stripping**, and Peter Faucitt's own **FNB Fraud Letter** (direct admission of fraud awareness and Exchange Control violations). The evidence presented meets and exceeds the standards for both civil and criminal liability, mandating a Section 162 Director Disqualification application.
