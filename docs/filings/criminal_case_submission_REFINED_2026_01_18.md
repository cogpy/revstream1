### Appendix: The 2020 Financial Manipulation Blueprint

Newly discovered trial balance evidence from 2019-2020 provides a blueprint for the financial manipulation that enabled the later fraud. This evidence is critical in establishing a long-standing pattern of behavior and proving that the 2025 events were not isolated incidents, but the culmination of a multi-year scheme.

**Key Mechanisms of Manipulation (2019-2020):**

1.  **Massive Inter-Company Debt**: Strategic Logistics (SLG) carried a **R13M debt** to RegimA Skin Treatments (RST), creating an artificial financial dependency that allowed for profit shifting through interest payments (R414K annually at a suspiciously low 3.19% rate).

2.  **Coordinated Cost Reallocations**: On February 20, 2020, multiple entities executed simultaneous journal entries to reallocate over **R1M in administrative fees** to production costs, deliberately obscuring true profitability and operational costs.

3.  **Systematic Cost Dumping**: RegimA Worldwide Distribution (RWW) was systematically used as an expense dumping ground, receiving a **R750K loan for production costs** from RST and bearing over **R1.7M in reallocated admin fees, warehouse charges, and computer expenses** for the group.

4.  **Capital Extraction via Property**: Villa Via, a property holding company, generated **R3.7M in profit** from rental income while maintaining a **R22.8M members' loan account** (5.2x its annual rental income), indicating a systematic mechanism for extracting capital from the business.

5.  **Centralized Control & Cover-up**: All entity accounts were controlled by the co-director's personal bookkeeper. The 6-month delay in finalizing the 2020 financial statements, coordinated by Danie Bantjes and signed off by Bernadine Wright, points to a complex and deliberate manipulation requiring extended time to orchestrate and conceal.

This evidence proves a clear *modus operandi* of financial deception that was in place years before the 2025 fraud was discovered. It demonstrates intent, premeditation, and a sophisticated understanding of how to exploit the inter-company structure for personal gain.
