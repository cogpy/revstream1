## 3. Burden of Proof Analysis

### Criminal Threshold (95%)

**7 events** meet the criminal threshold, with conclusive evidence:

*   **2025-02-25**: R5.2M SLG stock missing with simultaneous R5.2M invoice from SLG to RST. Stock physically disappeared, same type later supplied by Adderory to RegimA. Systematic asset stripping begins.
*   **2025-03-01**: R5.4M worth of stock physically disappears from Strategic Logistics warehouse. Represents 46% of annual sales, 10x historical adjustment rate. Same stock type later supplied by Adderory (Rynette's son's company) to RegimA.
*   **2025-03-30**: Rynette and Peter dumped two years' worth of unallocated expenses from all companies into RegimA Worldwide and pressured Daniel to sign off within 12 hours for SARS VAT & Annual Accounts. Daniel used time until June 6th to finalize reports and uncover fraud.
*   **2025-05-22**: CRITICAL EVENT: R1M+ monthly revenue → R0 (100% business shutdown). Central evidence destruction event proving consciousness of guilt. Destruction of audit trails for platform owned, paid, operated by RegimA Zone Ltd (UK) since July 2023 - proves RWD ZA has no independent revenue stream. Orders removed from Shopify following Jacqui's confrontation.
*   **2025-06-10**: CRITICAL EVENT: Bantjies dismisses Daniel's audit request 4 days after Daniel exposed Villa Via fraud. Audit would have discovered R5.4M stock adjustment fraud and systematic inter-company manipulation. Demonstrates consciousness of guilt and protection of fraud scheme.

**43 events** exceed the civil threshold, demonstrating a clear pattern of misconduct:

*   **2017-02-24**: RegimaSA (Pty) Ltd incorporated as Collections Agent
