## Overview

**Case Number:** 2025-137857  
**Application Type:** Ex parte urgent application  
**Filed:** August 13, 2025  
**Targets:** Both Jacqueline and Daniel Faucitt  
**Status:** Pending return date; notice of intention to oppose filed September 5, 2025

---

## Critical Timeline

### Trigger Event
**August 11, 2025:** Jacqueline signs "Main Trustee" document  
**August 13, 2025:** Interdict launched (**2 days later**)

This rapid response (48 hours) suggests the application was **pre-planned** and waiting for a trigger event.

### Key Preceding Event - Retaliatory Motive
**July 8, 2025:** [POPIA violation notice sent to Peter](application-1-evidence.md) 📄  
**August 13, 2025:** First interdict filed (**36 days later**)

This timeline demonstrates **retaliatory motive** under *Beinash v Wixley* - the application was filed in direct response to legitimate POPIA enforcement action.
