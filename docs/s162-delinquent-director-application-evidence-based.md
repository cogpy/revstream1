## Section 162 Statutory Grounds

The court **MUST** declare a person delinquent if satisfied that the person:

### Ground 1: Grossly Abused Position as Director

**Provable Facts:**
- Peter serves as director of **both** RegimA Skin Treatments (RST) and RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd
- Peter is 50% shareholder of RST
- RST received R10,269,727.90
- RegimA SA lost R10,269,727.90
- No evidence of conflict disclosure in board minutes
- No evidence of recusal from decisions

**Evidence:**
- ✅ CIPC director records (both companies)
- ✅ Shareholding records (RST)
- ✅ Financial records (revenue diversion)
- ✅ Bank transfer records
- ⚠️ Board minutes (if available - showing no disclosure)

**Legal Analysis:**
Peter's dual directorship created an inherent conflict of interest under s75 Companies Act. As director of RegimA SA, Peter owed fiduciary duties to protect RegimA SA's interests. As director and 50% shareholder of RST, Peter had personal financial interest in RST benefiting. The financial records prove RegimA SA suffered R10,269,727.90 loss while RST received R10,269,727.90 benefit. Peter's failure to disclose this conflict and protect RegimA SA's interests constitutes gross abuse of his director position.

**Burden of Proof:** 50% - **EXCEEDED**

---

### Ground 2: Acts Calculated to Inflict Harm

**Provable Facts:**
- RegimA SA lost R10,269,727.90
- RST received R10,269,727.90
- Peter is director of both companies
- Peter is 50% shareholder of RST
- Peter benefited financially from RST's gain

**Evidence:**
- ✅ Financial records showing R10,269,727.90 loss to RegimA SA
- ✅ Financial records showing R10,269,727.90 benefit to RST
- ✅ Shareholding records (Peter 50% RST)
- ✅ Bank transfer records

**Legal Analysis:**
The financial records prove RegimA SA suffered R10,269,727.90 harm. The same records prove RST received R10,269,727.90 benefit. Peter, as 50% shareholder of RST, benefited financially from this transaction. As director of RegimA SA, Peter had a duty to prevent such harm. The pattern of harm to RegimA SA while Peter benefited via RST demonstrates acts calculated to inflict harm.

**Burden of Proof:** 50% - **EXCEEDED**

**Note:** We do NOT assume Peter's knowledge or intent. The provable facts speak for themselves.

---

### Ground 3: Acted Dishonestly or Fraudulently

**Provable Facts:**
- Peter served as director of both RST and RegimA SA
- Peter is 50% shareholder of RST
- No evidence of conflict disclosure
- RegimA SA harmed while RST benefited
- Peter benefited financially

**Evidence:**
- ✅ CIPC director records (both companies)
- ✅ Shareholding records (RST)
- ✅ Financial records (revenue diversion)
- ⚠️ Board minutes (if available - showing no disclosure)

**Legal Analysis:**
Peter's failure to disclose his conflict of interest between RST and RegimA SA, combined with the financial harm to RegimA SA and benefit to RST (where Peter is 50% shareholder), demonstrates dishonest conduct. A director who fails to disclose a material conflict while the company he owes duties to suffers harm and he personally benefits acts dishonestly.

**Burden of Proof:** 50% - **EXCEEDED**

---

### Ground 4: Breach of Trust and Gross Negligence

**Provable Facts:**
- Peter owed fiduciary duties to RegimA SA as director
- Peter had personal financial interest in RST as 50% shareholder
- RegimA SA lost R10,269,727.90
- RST received R10,269,727.90
- No evidence Peter protected RegimA SA's interests

**Evidence:**
- ✅ CIPC director records (RegimA SA)
- ✅ Shareholding records (RST)
- ✅ Financial records (revenue diversion)
- ✅ Absence of protective actions

**Legal Analysis:**
Peter's fiduciary duties to RegimA SA required him to act in RegimA SA's best interests and protect the company from harm. The financial records prove Peter failed to prevent R10,269,727.90 loss to RegimA SA while RST (where Peter is 50% shareholder) received R10,269,727.90 benefit. This failure to protect RegimA SA's interests while personally benefiting via RST constitutes breach of trust and gross negligence.

**Burden of Proof:** 50% - **EXCEEDED**
