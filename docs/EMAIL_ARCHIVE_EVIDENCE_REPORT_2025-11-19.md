## Top 10 High-Priority Emails

### 1-5. The RegimA Group Results and Computer Expense Analysis (Priority: 15)

**Date**: 2025-06-10  
**Participants**: Danie Bantjes, Daniel Faucitt, Peter Faucitt, Jacqui Faucitt  
**Copies Found**: 5 (multiple accounts)

**Significance**: This email thread contains Daniel's comprehensive 26-point response to accountant Danie Bantjes, documenting the entire fraud scheme with specific evidence.

#### Bantjes' Initial Email

> "It saddens me to write this email this morning, as in my **30-odd year involvement with the Faucitt family business** I have never had to encounter or get involved with an internal dispute of this serious nature."

> "For any business to spend **in excess of 20% of revenue generated** on these services [IT and e-commerce platforms], the spend needs to be justified, transparent, relevant and needs to add the desired value to the business."

> "The other concerning aspect is that from my high-level analysis of the state of the finances of the RegimA Group as at 28 February 2025, it is concerning to notice that the Group has, **for the first time in its history, made a substantial trading loss** in the past financial year."

> "This reflects in the bank balances as well, which saw a **decline of R10m year-on-year** for the Group, including Villa Via."

#### Daniel's Comprehensive Response - 26 Key Claims

1. **Kayla's Murder Timeline**
   - "Worldwide has found itself absorbing all costs of all companies when the cards all expired in Aug 2023 **2 weeks after Kayla's murder**"
   - Emergency measure: expenses put on Worldwide cards with different expiry date
   - RegimA Skin Treatments and Strategic have no record of their actual computer expenses
   - "Everything was dumped in Worldwide"

2. **ReZonance Value and Profitability**
   - "The majority of these transactions belong in Rezonance, a technology and IT company Kayla and I spent nearly a decade building"
   - "As you can see from the ProfitandLoss.pdf **Rezonance made its first annual profit in Feb 2023** which Kayla and I celebrated"
   - "Rezonance currently owes me **ZAR 1.8 million** as a director from my investments over the years"
   - "You can understand why I firmly rejected Pete's insistence that I just close the company"

3. **Murder Investigation and Account Freeze**
   - "There was an ongoing murder investigation where the authorities reminded me of the familiar firearms rule that **life comes before property**"
   - "Instructed me to **freeze all activity immediately** while they conducted their investigations and resolve the financial issues later"
   - "Which is exactly what I have done"

4. **Daniel's Single-Handed Rebuilding**
   - "RegimA Worldwide Distribution absorbed the operational overhead of **4 large distribution partners between 2020 and 2023**"
   - "It did so with **no additional staff** as I **single-handedly rebuilt the entire demand side** of the distribution function"
   - "The margins are structured so that each hub uses its margin to cover the costs"

5. **Rynette's Unauthorized Control**
   - "The recent moves to **take all of the payments directly into an account which only Rynette has access to** and deny me any visibility while leaving all the expenses with me are not only bizarre but will ultimately prevent us from ever being able to resolve anything"
   - "Placing someone who is **neither a director or employee of Worldwide Distribution in complete control without any liability**"
   - "This is concerning as it makes me as a director **liable for their actions without my knowledge or consent**"
   - "**This cannot continue**"

6. **Revenue Growth and Decline**
   - "The year-on-year turnover increase from **2M to 12M to 19M** reflects the additional distribution activity it took on over the period"
   - "The significant drop of 1M to 18M the following year was **after Pete signed an affidavit to make himself the administrator** on the Worldwide accounts"
   - "All my automations were unhooked"

7. **Deliberate Sabotage**
   - "I informed Pete and Rynette prior to this **not to touch it or it would break the automations** but they did so anyway"
   - "I informed them after that I could no longer see the things I needed to complete the accounts"
   - "They need to ensure they know what they are doing"

8. **Unauthorized Banking Changes**
   - "Over the past year the bank contacted me on several occasions to ask for my approval where **Pete and Rynette had attempted to draft mandates to change the ownership structure, have my accounts closed and cancel my cards, all without my knowledge or consent**"
   - "I informed the bank these must be errors"
   - "Informed both Pete and Rynette to **cease this activity immediately**"

9. **Proper Billing Structure (Before Aug 2023)**
   - "The correct format up to Aug 2023 shows invoices from Rezonance which group the services with itemized billing"
   - "This involves a **10% mark-up for Rezonance managed services**"
   - "I use to also cover the account processing where I have a system that remunerates **R50 for whoever is managing the 3rd party service** for each invoice"
   - "Ensuring its line items, forex rates etc are correctly filled in on quickbooks for comprehensive records"

10. **Loss of Proper Accounting (After Aug 2023)**
    - "After Aug 2023 you can see **all items are allocated to FNB which is the auto bank feed** I have on Worldwide accounts"
    - No more itemized ReZonance invoices
    - Loss of proper accounting controls

11. **Trust Account Structure**
    - "The actual companies RegimA Zone and RegimA SA that operate the Shopify systems were configured to operate the distribution functions **using trust accounts**"
    - "RegimA SA with Pete and I as directors was doing this with Dermal (Barend)"
    - "RegimA Zone (Only me as director) was an aggregation of 3 smaller distributions"

12. **Protection Against Theft**
    - "I had specifically structured it this way to **prevent Pete from doing to me what he did to Kachan**"
    - "Simply taking the revenue for himself by instructing people to pay into another account"
    - "**(Which is basically what has happened)**"

13. **Legal Definition of Theft**
    - "The problem is that since the ownership of the companies is not the same (i.e. I am not a member of RegimA Skin Treatments and the other companies are not subsidiaries), therefore there is no fixed 'group' or intercompany"
    - "**Moving assets from a company where I am a director to a company where I am not is essentially theft** or at the very least fraudulent for tax purposes"

14. **Not a Family Dispute**
    - "I urge you to keep this in mind as these issues should not be dismissed as 'family disputes' when there is a **distinct material and legal difference between ownership of companies** which should be treated as such"

15. **Outstanding ReZonance Debt**
    - "I have been telling both Pete and Rynette for 4 years now that the **outstanding amounts owed to Rezonance need to be paid** before I am able to purchase the services and continue as normal"
    - "Attached is the Rezonance Febr 2023.PDF showing **over 1M outstanding owed by RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance**"

16. **Fraudulent Payment Allocation**
    - "For reasons I can only speculate, in 2024 **Rynette made the debt to Rezonance 'disappear'** by misallocating international GoDaddy payments as though they were local payments made to Rezonance"
    - "**Yet Rezonance received no such payments** (the amounts are still outstanding)"

17. **Tax Fraud Implications**
    - "I was explaining to Pete that these need to be corrected before I submit Rezonance accounts as there will immediately be a **mismatch showing Rezonance never received the payments**"
    - "They will **flag as fraudulent on RegimA Skin Treatments with SARS**"
    - "This was just ignored and they opted instead to try and close my accounts and dissolve my company"
    - "**This cannot continue**"

18. **Exclusive Access to Accounts**
    - "Bear in mind that **Pete does not use the computer and has never seen the actual accounts** for the company"
    - "**Nor has Jacqui and nor have I**"
    - "**They exist solely on Rynette's computer and nobody else is able to see them**"

19. **Suspected Massive Fraud**
    - "The amounts I can see going through Strategic and RegimA Skin Treatments **seem off the charts**"
    - "We need an **internal audit with extreme urgency** to see what is going on there"

20. **Proposed Remedy**
    - Inform SARS about freezing activity in cooperation with law enforcement for murder inquiry
    - Explain updating affected records to reconcile past 2 years for accurate account
    - Make payments from RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance
    - Correctly allocate 2014 GoDaddy expenses to GoDaddy
    - Process invoices same way as before Aug 2023 (single invoice from Rezonance each month)
    - Configure Paystack systems on Shopify to split payments directly into Distribution and Manufacturer accounts

21. **Cannot Sign Off Fraudulent Transactions**
    - "We cannot just try to shoehorn an entire architecture for multiple distribution operations into one account"
    - "**The transactions on RegimA Skin Treatments must not be signed off as they will later show up as fraudulent**"

#### Bantjes' Response

**Date**: 2025-06-10 (same day, 3:33 PM)  
**Tone**: Dismissive

> "Thank you for the speedy response. Your comments and assertions will be taken under consideration in due course. I am unfortunately **away for 2 weeks, with little or no access to my communications**. In the meantime I implore everyone to try and work out a solution to the position we find ourselves in."

**Significance**: Bantjes completely avoids addressing any of Daniel's 26 specific claims and evidence. Instead, he:
- Acknowledges receipt but takes no action
- Leaves for 2 weeks immediately after receiving detailed fraud evidence
- Suggests parties "work it out" rather than investigating
- **Consistent with conflict of interest** (R18.75M (Ketoni debt to FFT) debt to trust)
