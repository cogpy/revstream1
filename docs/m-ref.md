# M-REF: Master Legal Reference

**Case:** 2025-137857  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-04

This page summarizes the critical legal analysis documents that prove the ex parte interdict was obtained through perjury and used to facilitate a R10.6M+ extraction scheme.

---

## Core Thesis

The ex parte interdict obtained by Peter Faucitt on 19 August 2025 was **not** a legitimate legal remedy. It was the culmination of a premeditated scheme to:

1. **Sabotage Daniel financially** by secretly cancelling his company cards
2. **Force him to use personal funds** to pay for business expenses
3. **Frame his necessary reimbursement as "extraction"** by fabricating the "birthday gift" narrative
4. **Obtain a court order based on perjury** to override Daniel's legitimate SOLE authority
5. **Use the court order to steal millions** from the company accounts

## Critical Discovery: SOLE vs ANY TWO TOGETHER

A key finding is the difference in banking mandates across entities:

| Entity | Mandate Type | Implication |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Strategic Logistics CC | **SOLE** | Any administrator can act independently |
| RégimA Skin Treatments CC | **SOLE** | Any administrator can act independently |
| Villa Via | **SOLE** | Any administrator can act independently |
| **RégimA SA (Pty) Ltd** | **ANY TWO TOGETHER** | Requires Daniel + Peter for any action |

**Key Implications:**
- On **SOLE** mandate accounts, Daniel's actions were **pre-authorized** by the mandate itself
- On **ANY TWO TOGETHER** accounts (RSA), Daniel's consent was **legally required** for any transaction
- The March 2025 ABSA diversion on RSA was **unauthorized** because Daniel didn't consent

## The R500K "Birthday Gift" Perjury

### Peter's Sworn Statement (Paragraph 7.18)

> "She [Jacqueline Faucitt] adopted an 'I will show you' approach, defended our son, and then **transferred to him the sum of R500,000.00** from the corporations, on or about 16 July 2025, **as a 'birthday gift'**, which **I did not authorise**, and which **he was not entitled to accept**"

### The Truth

| Peter's Claim | The Reality |
|---------------|-------------|
| "She transferred it..." | **False.** Daniel initiated the transfer himself using his SOLE authority |
| "...as a 'birthday gift'" | **False.** It was a reimbursement for R520,000+ in business expenses Daniel paid personally |
| "...which I did not authorise" | **Irrelevant.** Daniel held SOLE authority; Peter's authorization was not required |
| "...which he was not entitled to accept." | **False.** As a director with SOLE authority who had funded the company R520,000, he was entitled to reimburse himself |

### The Financial Reality (16 July 2025)

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Daniel put IN (from personal savings, May-Jul) | R 520,000.00 |
| Daniel received BACK (from company) | R 500,000.00 |
| **Net Position** | **-R 20,000.00** |

**Even after the R500,000 transfer, Daniel was still R20,000 out of pocket.**

## The Financial Sabotage Timeline

### Phase 1: Premeditation (March - May 2025)

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 28 Mar 2025 | Peter requests to become SARS Registered Representative | Premeditated control seizure |
| 3 Jun 2025 | Bantjies emails Rynette about "computer expense line" items | Investigation into Daniel's IT expenses |
| 5 Jun 2025 | Rynette emails Bantjies about SARS query, CC'ing Anton Hechter | Unusual SARS official connection |

### Phase 2: Trigger and Retaliation (6-7 June 2025)

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **6 Jun 2025** | **Daniel exposes fraud to Bantjies** | The trigger event |
| **7 Jun 2025** | **Daniel's cards secretly cancelled** | Immediate retaliation (<24 hours) |

### Phase 3: The Financial Bleed (7 June - 16 July 2025)

Daniel was forced to pay for critical business infrastructure from personal accounts:

| Period | Amount from Personal Savings |
|--------|------------------------------|
| May - June 2025 | R 210,000 |
| June - July 2025 | R 150,000 |
| July (before 16th) | R 160,000 |
| **Total** | **R 520,000** |

On **16 July 2025**, Daniel's personal account hit **R 864.45** — personally insolvent from paying company bills.

### Phase 4: The Real Extraction (3-11 September 2025)

With the interdict in hand, Peter extracted:

| Date | Entity | Amount |
|------|--------|--------|
| 3 Sep 2025 | RWD | R 5,164,131.18 |
| 11 Sep 2025 | RST | R 3,090,000.00 |
| 11 Sep 2025 | VVA | R 1,730,000.00 |
| 11 Sep 2025 | SLG | R 640,000.00 |
| **Total** | | **R 10,624,131.18** |

**Daniel's alleged "extraction" of R500,000 over one month was used to justify Peter's actual extraction of R10.6M+ in eight days.**

---

## The Impersonation Fraud

Peter claims he "doesn't use email or computers." This creates a dilemma:

| If TRUE | If FALSE |
|---------|----------|
| Rynette has been impersonating Peter | Peter has been lying to the court |
| All digital "Peter" authorizations are forged | Peter is complicit in excluding Daniel |
| The ABSA diversion was unauthorized | Peter committed perjury |

**Either way, crimes have been committed.**

### What Rynette Controls (Without Authorization)

| System/Account | Rynette's Access |
|----------------|------------------|
| pete@regima.com | Full control |
| Company bank accounts | Operational access |
| Xero/Sage accounting | Administrator |
| ABSA account (revenue diversion) | Controller |

### What Rynette Is NOT

| Role | Status |
|------|--------|
| Director of RégimA SA | **NO** |
| Authorized signatory on FNB mandate | **NO** |
| Shareholder of RégimA SA | **NO** |
| Legally authorized to act for Peter | **NO** |

---

## The Oversight Chain Conspiracy

Four layers of financial oversight "failed" to detect the fraud Daniel identified:

| Layer | Person | Role | Conflict of Interest |
|-------|--------|------|----------------------|
| 1 | Peter Faucitt | Finance Director | Beneficiary of the scheme |
| 2 | Rynette Farrar | Internal Bookkeeper | Controlled accounting; son's company (Adderory) was supplier |
| 3 | Danie Bantjies | External Accountant | Unlawfully appointed FFT Trustee; CFO of George Group (Ketoni connection) |
| 4 | Anton Hechter | SARS Contact | Insider contact who could "close" SARS queries |

---

## Legal Implications

### For Peter Faucitt

| Crime | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| **Perjury** | False "birthday gift" narrative under oath |
| **Fraud on the Court** | Obtaining interdict based on fabricated claims |
| **Abuse of Process** | Using court order to override valid banking mandate |
| **Breach of Fiduciary Duty** | Acting against company/co-director interests |

### For Rynette Farrar

|-------|----------|
| **Forgery** | Signing/authorizing as Peter |
| **Identity Theft** | Using Peter's identity for transactions |
| **Fraud** | Obtaining benefits through deception |
| **Unauthorized Access** | Controlling accounts without authority |

### For Both

| Crime | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| **Conspiracy to Defraud** | Coordinated scheme to exclude Daniel |
| **Theft** | R10.6M+ extraction using fraudulent interdict |
