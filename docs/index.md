**Last Updated:** 2026-01-08  
**Evidence Repository:** [cogpy/ad-res-j7](https://github.com/cogpy/ad-res-j7)  
**Data Models Version:** Entities v23.0, Relations v18.1, Events v21.1, Timeline v19.0

## Executive Summary

This documentation repository provides a comprehensively refined, evidence-based analysis of the systematic hijacking of revenue streams in the RegimA business operations case. All data models have been cross-referenced with the **ad-res-j7** evidence repository to ensure factual accuracy and legal integrity.

**Critical Revelation:** The Shopify platform has been owned and paid for since July 2023 by Daniel Faucitt's independent UK entity **RegimA Zone Ltd**. RWD ZA has no independent revenue stream—all revenues were generated through infrastructure owned, paid for, and operated by Daniel's UK company.
