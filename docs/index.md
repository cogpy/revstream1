All data models have been cross-referenced with the `ad-res-j7` evidence repository to ensure factual accuracy and legal integrity.

**Critical Revelation:** The **Shopify platform** has been owned and paid for since **July 2023** by Daniel Faucitt's independent UK entity **RegimA Zone Ltd**. RWD ZA has no independent revenue stream—all revenues were generated through infrastructure owned, paid for, and operated by Daniel's UK company.
