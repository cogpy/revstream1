# Revenue Stream Hijacking Case 2025-137857

## Executive Summary

This documentation repository provides comprehensive evidence and analysis of the systematic hijacking of revenue streams in the RegimA business operations case. The case involves **three sequential interdict applications** filed over a 6-month period (March-November 2025), documenting **R10,269,727.90** in total losses.

### Critical Revelation

The **Shopify platform** has been owned and paid for since **July 2023** by Daniel Faucitt's independent UK entity **RegimA Zone Ltd** (28+ months, R140K-R280K total investment).

**Key Implication:** RWD ZA has no independent revenue stream - all revenues were generated through infrastructure owned, paid for, and operated by Daniel's UK company.

## Significance

This documentation demonstrates **systematic coordination** across multiple crime categories over an 8-year period (2017-2025), with particular emphasis on:

1. **The Shopify Platform Revelation** - RWD ZA generated no independent revenue; all operations dependent on infrastructure owned by RegimA Zone Ltd (UK)

2. **Consciousness of Guilt** - Multiple evidence destruction events showing awareness of criminal conduct

3. **Family Conspiracy** - Coordinated actions across multiple family members and associates

4. **Financial Crimes** - R115M+ in documented financial impact across all phases

5. **Trust Law Violations** - Systematic breach of fiduciary duties by trustee

The pattern of events supports charges of organized criminal enterprise, systematic fraud and theft, evidence destruction, family conspiracy, trust law violations, and financial crimes.
