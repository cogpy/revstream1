# Revenue Stream Hijacking Case 2025-137857

## Executive Summary

This documentation repository provides comprehensive evidence and analysis of the systematic hijacking of revenue streams in the RegimA business operations case. The case involves **three sequential interdict applications** filed over a 6-month period (March-November 2025), documenting **R10,269,727.90** in total documented losses.

**Critical Revelation:** The **Shopify platform** has been owned and paid for since **July 2023** by Daniel Faucitt's independent UK entity **RegimA Zone Ltd** (28+ months, R140K-R280K total investment). RWD ZA has no independent revenue stream—all revenues were generated through infrastructure owned, paid for, and operated by Daniel's UK company.

**Latest Update:** December 5, 2025 - Enhanced with refined data models (Entities v25, Events v27, Relations v21, Timeline v18) and improved legal filings.

## Key Patterns & Evidence

### 1. Systematic Coordination

The timeline reveals coordinated action across three distinct crime categories:

- **Revenue Theft:** 7 events targeting business operations
- **Trust Violations:** 6 events manipulating family trust structure
- **Financial Manipulation:** 13 events diverting and concealing funds

### 2. Shopify Platform Centrality

**10 out of 15 events** (67%) directly involve the Shopify platform:

- Platform owned and paid for by RegimA Zone Ltd (UK) since July 2023
- 28+ months of continuous funding (R140K-R280K total investment)
- **Critical implication:** RWD ZA has no independent revenue stream

### 3. Evidence Destruction Pattern

Two critical evidence destruction events demonstrating consciousness of guilt:

- **May 22, 2025:** Shopify audit trail hijacking (platform destruction)
- **August 20, 2025:** Financial evidence concealment (cover-up operations)
- **September 15, 2025:** Evidence suppression pattern identified (EVENT_070) [NEW]

### 4. Family Conspiracy Elements

Multiple family members involved in coordinated criminal activity:

- **Peter Faucitt:** Primary perpetrator (11 events)
- **Rynette Farrar:** Co-conspirator (8 events)
- **Adderory (Rynette's son):** Domain registration for identity fraud
