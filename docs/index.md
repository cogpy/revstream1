## 🚨 FEBRUARY 2026: CRITICAL UPDATE

### Corrected Financial Motive: The Ketoni-Bantjies Connection

The central financial motive has been corrected and is **more damning than previously understood**.

> **Ketoni Investment Holdings owes R18.685M to the Faucitt Family Trust**, not a personal debt involving Bantjies.

This places Trustee **Danie Bantjies** in a position of **controlling both ends of the transaction** through his connection to Ketoni's director (Kevin Derrick), creating **six distinct conflicts of interest** and enabling charges of **insider trading** and **self-dealing**.
