## 🔍 Critical Evidence Highlights

### 🏆 The "Forensic Time Capsule" (Annexure JF1)

**The single most important piece of evidence in the entire case.**

**Date:** 26 July 2017  
**Source:** Shopify Plus onboarding email from Richard Estabrooks (Shopify Launch Manager)  
**Recipients:** Kayla Pretorius (kayp@rzo.io, kayla@regima.zone), CC: Daniel Faucitt

**What it proves:**
- ✅ Kayla Pretorius personally managed Shopify Plus onboarding
- ✅ Daniel was directly involved (CC'd on communications)
- ✅ Independent business operations (no "head office" involvement)
- ✅ Direct client relationship management
- ✅ Use of independent email addresses
- ✅ Personal phone number (011 615 29869) - later appropriated

**What it refutes:**
- ❌ Applicant's claim of centralized "head office" control
- ❌ Applicant's claim that Daniel never operated independent businesses
- ❌ Applicant's claim that Daniel is "delusional"
- ❌ Applicant's claim that Jacqui has "dementia"

**Legal Significance:** Contemporaneous documentary evidence from a neutral third party (Shopify Inc.) - an unalterable historical record that cannot be disputed.
