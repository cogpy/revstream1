This documentation demonstrates **systematic coordination** across multiple crime categories over an 8-year period (2017-2025), with particular emphasis on:

1. **The Shopify Platform Revelation** - RWD ZA generated no independent revenue; all operations dependent on infrastructure owned by RegimA Zone Ltd (UK)

2. **Consciousness of Guilt** - Multiple evidence destruction events showing awareness of criminal conduct

3. **Family Conspiracy** - Coordinated actions across multiple family members and associates

4. **Financial Crimes** - R115M+ in documented financial impact across all phases

5. **Trust Law Violations** - Systematic breach of fiduciary duties by trustee

The pattern of events supports charges of organized criminal enterprise, systematic fraud and theft, evidence destruction, family conspiracy, trust law violations, and financial crimes.
