**Case Number:** 2025-137857  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-29

---

## Case Overview

This site provides a comprehensive and organized repository of evidence, data models, and legal filings related to the systematic hijacking of revenue streams and associated fraudulent activities. The documentation is structured to support ongoing civil, criminal, and regulatory actions.

## Central Motive: The R18.75M Ketoni Payout Scheme

The primary motive driving the fraudulent activities is the anticipated **R18.75 million payout** from Ketoni Investment Holdings, due in May 2026. The Faucitt Family Trust holds shares valued at this amount, with the proceeds intended to be split equally between Peter Faucitt and Jacqueline Faucitt. The evidence demonstrates a clear and coordinated scheme by Peter Faucitt and his co-conspirators to unlawfully seize Jacqueline Faucitt's R9.375 million share through a fraudulent curatorship application.
