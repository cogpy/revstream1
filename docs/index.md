**Case Number:** 2025-137857  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-31

---

## Case Overview

This site provides a comprehensive and organized repository of evidence, data models, and legal filings related to the systematic hijacking of revenue streams and associated fraudulent activities. The documentation is structured to support ongoing civil, criminal, and regulatory actions.

## Central Motive: The R18.75M Ketoni Payout Scheme

The primary motive driving the fraudulent activities is the anticipated **R18.75 million payout** from Ketoni Investment Holdings, due in May 2026. The Faucitt Family Trust holds shares valued at this amount, with the proceeds intended to be split equally between Peter Faucitt and Jacqueline Faucitt. The evidence demonstrates a clear and coordinated scheme by Peter Faucitt and his co-conspirators to unlawfully seize Jacqueline Faucitt's R9.375 million share through a fraudulent curatorship application.

## Evidence Standards & Burden of Proof

This case involves multiple legal proceedings, each with different evidentiary standards:

### Civil Proceedings (50%+ - Balance of Probabilities)
The civil answering affidavit demonstrates that the evidence overwhelmingly favors the respondents, exceeding the required 50% threshold. The applicant's claims are systematically refuted with documentary evidence, financial records, and contemporaneous correspondence.

### Criminal Proceedings (95%+ - Beyond Reasonable Doubt)
The criminal complaint presents evidence that meets the stringent "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard for the following offenses:
- **Fraud** (multiple counts)
- **Perjury** (material misrepresentations under oath)
- **POPIA Violations** (unauthorized data processing and privacy breaches)
- **Companies Act Violations** (director misconduct and financial irregularities)

### Regulatory Proceedings (Administrative Standards)
Regulatory complaints are supported by documentary evidence meeting the respective administrative standards for:
- **CIPC** (Companies and Intellectual Property Commission)
- **NPA** (National Prosecuting Authority - Tax Fraud)
- **Information Regulator** (POPIA enforcement)
