2. **Verify GitHub Pages** are rendering correctly
3. **Cross-check evidence references** in all documents
4. **Validate entity relationship diagram** for clarity

### Future Enhancements
1. **Add SF10 workflow analysis** to entity operations documentation
2. **Create burden of proof matrix** for each claim type
3. **Develop evidence strength calculator** based on corroboration
4. **Generate timeline visualization** as PNG/SVG for presentations
5. **Create entity network graph** with evidence strength indicators

### Legal Strategy
1. **Prioritize criminal charges** with strong evidence (identity impersonation, obstruction)
2. **Leverage SF9 quantum** in all civil and criminal claims
3. **Emphasize Section 163 oppression** with SF2B evidence
4. **Highlight Peter's fiduciary breaches** with comprehensive evidence package

## Conclusion

This comprehensive refinement has successfully integrated critical new evidence into all aspects of the case documentation. The R63 million quantum is now formally documented by attorney demand (SF9), Rynette's control and impersonation capabilities are proven with direct evidence (SF2A/SF2B), and all data models, GitHub Pages, and legal filings have been updated to reflect this evidence.

The burden of proof analysis demonstrates that civil claims exceed the 50% threshold and criminal claims for identity impersonation and obstruction of access meet the 95% threshold. The case is now well-positioned for both civil and criminal proceedings.

All changes have been successfully committed and pushed to the GitHub repository, ensuring that the documentation is current, comprehensive, and evidence-based.
