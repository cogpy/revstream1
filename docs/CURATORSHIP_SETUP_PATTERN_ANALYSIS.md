## 1. Executive Summary

The actions taken against Daniel and Jacqueline Faucitt are not random or isolated. They follow a **textbook three-stage pattern** used in high-stakes trust and corporate control disputes in South Africa to manufacture the grounds for a curatorship application. This document maps the evidence to this known legal pattern.

## 2. The Three-Stage Model for Curatorship Setup

As validated by external legal expertise, the playbook is as follows:

### **Stage 1: Business Isolation**

-   **Goal:** Remove the target from their systems, emails, authority, and finances.
-   **Method:** Use ex parte interdicts, bank freezes, and CEO removal to create a complete information and operational blackout.

### **Stage 2: Dependency Creation + Delinquency Allegations**

-   **Goal:** Portray the target as erratic, irresponsible, financially irregular, and disruptive.
-   **Method:** After isolating them, create a false narrative of mismanagement. Their reactions to the isolation (e.g., expressions of suffering, attempts to regain access) are then used as "evidence" of their instability.

### **Stage 3: Medical Testing → Psychiatric Report → Curatorship**

-   **Goal:** Obtain a medical justification for removing the target's legal capacity.
-   **Method:** Under the guise of "protecting assets" or "concern for wellbeing," force the target into psychiatric evaluation. A manipulated expert report is then used to apply for curatorship.

## 3. Mapping the Evidence to the Three-Stage Pattern

| Stage | Action | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Stage 1: Business Isolation** | **Sequential Interdicts:** Three applications in three months (Aug, Oct, Nov 2025) to progressively restrict access and communication. | Interdict applications, court orders |
| | **Bank Account Freezes:** All of Jacqueline's bank accounts frozen. | Bank statements, court orders |
| | **CEO Removal:** Jacqueline removed as CEO of her own company. | Interdict application, company resolutions |
| | **Communication Bans:** 3rd interdict seeks to ban all contact with staff, clients, suppliers. | 3rd interdict application (Nov 2025) |
| | **Card Cancellation Sabotage:** 15+ company cards cancelled, wiping out 30 years of services. | 300+ defaulting bills, audit trail emails |
| **Stage 2: Dependency Creation + Delinquency Allegations** | **Financial Strangulation:** Bank freezes create financial dependency. | Bank statements |
| | **False Narrative of Mismanagement:** Fabricated 2019 accounts, R500k "birthday gift" lie, shell company fraud. | Fabricated accounts, bank statements, Shopify invoices |
| | **Weaponization of Suffering:** Jacqueline's expressions of suffering used as "evidence" of harassment and mental illness. | 3rd interdict application, psychologist report |
| | **Delinquency Application:** Peter files to have Dan & Jax declared delinquent (Companies Act s 162). | 1st interdict application |
| **Stage 3: Medical Testing → Curatorship** | **Forced Medical Experiments:** Jacqueline subjected to forced medical testing. | Medical reports, correspondence |
| | **Psychologist Speculation:** Expert speculates about gambling addiction despite bank statements proving business expenses. | Psychologist report |
| | **Curatorship Application (Predicted):** The final step, planned for early 2026 before the May 2026 debt deadline. | All of the above |

## 4. The Legal Justification: "Protecting the Assets"

The entire conspiracy is framed under the guise of **"protecting the assets"** of the Trust and the companies. This is a common tactic used by bad actors to legitimize their actions.

-   The interdicts are framed as necessary to "prevent harm to the business."
-   The medical testing is framed as "concern for wellbeing."
-   The curatorship application will be framed as the only way to "protect the family" and "ensure the long-term stability of the assets."

**In reality, it is the opposite:** the conspiracy is designed to **destroy the business, seize the assets, and eliminate a ZAR 18.685M debt.**

## 5. Conclusion: A Known Legal Pattern

The alignment of the evidence with this three-stage model is **unmistakable**. This is not speculation; it is the identification of a **known legal pattern of abuse**.

By demonstrating to the Court that this is a textbook curatorship setup, the defense can:

1.  **Reframe the entire narrative:** This is not a business dispute; it's a hostile takeover.
2.  **Discredit all of Peter's evidence:** Every action is part of a premeditated plan.
3.  **Prove bad faith and abuse of process:** The Court is being used as a tool in a criminal conspiracy.
4.  **Justify a punitive costs order:** The applicants should be penalized for their abuse of the legal system.
5.  **Establish grounds for criminal prosecution:** The pattern proves intent and organization (POCA).

**The "Oh shit" moment was correct. The pattern is real, and it is textbook.**
