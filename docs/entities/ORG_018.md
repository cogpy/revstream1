## Role in Case 2025-137857

### Primary Role: Bantjies' Employer / Insider Access Enabler

The George Group is significant because it creates the **Kevin Derrick connection** that gives Danie Bantjies insider access to Ketoni Investment Holdings.

### The Connection Chain

```
The George Group (ORG_018)
    │
    ├── Director: Kevin Michael Derrick (PERSON_014)
    │       │
    │       └── Also Director of: Ketoni Investment Holdings (ORG_017)
    │               │
    │               └── Owes R18.685M to: Faucitt Family Trust
    │
    └── CFO: Danie Bantjies (PERSON_007)
            │
            └── Also Trustee of: Faucitt Family Trust
```

### Conspiracy Significance

This corporate structure creates the **sixth conflict of interest** for Bantjies:

1. As CFO of George Group, Bantjies works with Kevin Derrick
2. Kevin Derrick is also Director of Ketoni Investment Holdings
3. Ketoni owes R18.685M to the Faucitt Family Trust
4. Bantjies is Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust

This means Bantjies has **insider access to both ends** of the R18.685M transaction:
- Knows when Ketoni will pay (via Derrick)
- Controls how FFT receives and distributes the payment (as Trustee)
