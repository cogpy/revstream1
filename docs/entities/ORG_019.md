## Significance

### 1. Proves Rynette Has Separate Legal Protection

The fact that Rynette has her own attorneys (Pottas) while also being defended by Peter's attorneys (Elliott) demonstrates:
- Rynette is a significant figure in the conspiracy
- Multiple legal resources are being deployed to protect her
- Coordinated defense strategy across conspirators

### 2. Proves Elliott Attorneys Coordination

Elliott Attorneys sent the Letter of Demand **on behalf of Rynette**, even though:
- Rynette is not their client (Peter is)
- Rynette is not a party to the litigation
- This suggests improper coordination
