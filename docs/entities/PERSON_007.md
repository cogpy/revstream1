# Daniel Jacobus Bantjies (PERSON_007)

**Role:** Strategic Appointee / FFT Trustee / Accountant / CFO  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-06

## Summary

Daniel Jacobus Bantjies ("Danie") is a strategic appointee in Case 2025-137857, serving as FFT Trustee while simultaneously acting as accountant for all RegimA group companies and CFO of The George Group. His appointment by Rynette in **July 2024** (T-10 months before the Ketoni payout) and his professional connection to **Kevin Derrick** (Ketoni Director) at The George Group creates **six distinct conflicts of interest**.

**CRITICAL CORRECTION (2026-02-06):** The debt structure has been corrected. Ketoni Investment Holdings owes R18.685M to the Faucitt Family Trust (NOT Bantjies owing Peter/Jacqui). This creates an even more damning scenario where Bantjies has **insider access to both ends of the transaction**.

## SIX CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (Corrected 2026-02-06)

| # | Conflict | Description | Evidence |
|---|----------|-------------|----------|
| **1** | **Commissioner of Oaths** | Swore own false affidavit | Court records |
| **2** | **Trustee of FFT** | Controls victims' Trust assets | FFT appointment docs |
| **3** | **Affidavit Witness** | Provided perjured supporting testimony | Interdict application |
| **4** | **CFO of George Group** | Where Kevin Derrick is Director | Employment records |
| **5** | **Insider Access to Ketoni** | Through Kevin Derrick connection | Corporate records |
| **6** | **Controls Distribution** | As Trustee, decides how R18.685M is distributed | Trust deed |

## Corrected Debt Structure (2026-02-06)

### Previous (INCORRECT) Understanding
> "Bantjies' investment company owes Peter and Jacqui R18.685 million"

### Corrected Understanding
> "Ketoni Investment Holdings (K2023562189) owes R18.685M to the Faucitt Family Trust under a Call Option Agreement"

### Why This Is More Damning

Bantjies controls **BOTH ENDS** of the R18.685M transaction:

```
KETONI INVESTMENT HOLDINGS (K2023562189)
           │
           │ Owes R18.685M (Call Option)
           │
           │ ← Bantjies has INSIDER ACCESS via Kevin Derrick
           ▼
    FAUCITT FAMILY TRUST
           │
           │ ← Bantjies CONTROLS as Trustee
           ▼
    BENEFICIARIES (Peter, Jacqui, Daniel)
           │
           │ ← Bantjies CONTROLS DISTRIBUTION
           ▼
    R18.685M / 3 = R6.228M per beneficiary
```

**Complete Control Loop:**
1. Bantjies knows when Ketoni will pay (insider via Derrick)
2. Bantjies controls how Trust receives payment (as Trustee)
3. Bantjies controls distribution to beneficiaries (as Trustee)
4. If Jacqui "incapacitated" → Peter controls her share
5. Peter can then pay Bantjies (quid pro quo for helping scheme)
