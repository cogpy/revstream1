## Role in Case 2025-137857

### Primary Role: Debtor to Faucitt Family Trust

Ketoni Investment Holdings owes **R18.685 million** to the Faucitt Family Trust under a **Call Option Agreement**. The first exercise window is **May 2026**.

### Financial Details

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Debt Amount** | R18,685,000 |
| **Debt Type** | Call Option Agreement |
| **Creditor** | Faucitt Family Trust |
| **First Exercise Window** | May 2026 |
| **FFT Shareholding** | 5,000 A-Ordinary shares (Certificate #3) |

### Conspiracy Significance

This debt is the **central financial motive** for the entire conspiracy. The corrected understanding (as of 2026-02-06) reveals:

1. **Ketoni owes FFT** (not Bantjies owing Peter/Jacqui)
2. **Bantjies has insider access** to Ketoni through Kevin Derrick
3. **Bantjies controls distribution** as FFT Trustee

This creates a scenario where Bantjies controls **both ends of the transaction**:
- Knows when Ketoni will pay (via Derrick connection)
- Controls how FFT receives and distributes the payment
