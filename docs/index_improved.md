## Key Patterns & Evidence

### 1. Systematic Coordination

The timeline reveals coordinated action across three distinct crime categories:

- **Revenue Theft:** 7 events targeting business operations
- **Trust Violations:** 6 events manipulating family trust structure
- **Financial Manipulation:** 13 events diverting and concealing funds

### 2. Shopify Platform Centrality

**10 out of 15 events** (67%) directly involve the Shopify platform:

- Platform owned and paid for by RegimA Zone Ltd (UK) since July 2023
- 28+ months of continuous funding (R140K-R280K total investment)
- **Critical implication:** RWD ZA has no independent revenue stream

### 3. Evidence Destruction Pattern

Two critical evidence destruction events demonstrating consciousness of guilt:

- **May 22, 2025:** Shopify audit trail hijacking (platform destruction)
- **August 20, 2025:** Financial evidence concealment (cover-up operations)

### 4. Family Conspiracy Elements

Multiple family members involved in coordinated criminal activity:

- **Peter Faucitt:** Primary perpetrator (11 events)
- **Rynette Farrar:** Co-conspirator (8 events)
- **Addarory (Rynette's son):** Domain registration for identity fraud
