# RevStream1 Data Model Refinement - Executive Report

**Date:** November 12, 2025  
**Case:** 2025-137857 Revenue Stream Hijacking  
**Repositories Analyzed:** cogpy/revstream1, cogpy/ad-res-j7  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - All changes committed and pushed

---

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive analysis and refinement of the RevStream1 data models has been completed, incorporating extensive evidence from the ad-res-j7 repository. Critical data quality issues have been resolved, missing entities and events have been added, and all changes have been successfully synchronized to the repository.

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. ORG_007 Duplication (CRITICAL - RESOLVED ✅)

**Problem:** Entity ID ORG_007 was used for three different organizations, creating severe referential integrity issues.

**Resolution:**
- **ORG_008**: ReZonance (Pty) Ltd - Victim, IT services provider, owed R1,035,361.34
- **ORG_009**: Adderory (Pty) Ltd - Accomplice, competing business, registered April 2021
- **ORG_010**: Adderory Skin (Pty) Ltd - Accomplice, competing business, registered April 2021

**Impact:** Eliminated confusion between victim (ReZonance) and accomplice (Adderory) entities, enabling accurate network analysis.

### 2. Missing PERSON_003 (HIGH PRIORITY - RESOLVED ✅)

**Problem:** Rynette's son was referenced throughout the data but not defined as an entity.

**Resolution:** Added PERSON_003 with comprehensive details:
- Name: Adderory (Rynette's Son)
- Role: Co-conspirator, family member, accomplice
- Financial Impact: R5,400,000+
- Relationships: Son of PERSON_002, owner of ORG_009 and ORG_010
- Key Actions: Domain registration fraud, company registration, stock supply fraud

**Impact:** Completed the family conspiracy network, enabling full network analysis of mother-son collusion.

### 3. Missing Historical Events (RESOLVED ✅)

**Problem:** Critical events from 2021-2025 were not documented in the timeline.

**Resolution:** Added 5 new events:

1. **EVENT_H009** - Adderory Companies Registration (April 2021)
   - Demonstrates 4-year pre-planning
   - Registered Adderory (Pty) Ltd and Adderory Skin (Pty) Ltd
   - Evidence of systematic conspiracy preparation

2. **EVENT_H010** - Kayla Pretorius Murder (2023)
   - Estate complications: R1,035,000 debt
   - Law enforcement investigation
   - Family trauma context

3. **EVENT_023** - Chantal Letter (January 2025)
   - Estate finalization exploitation
   - Timing correlates with revenue hijacking

4. **EVENT_028** - R5.2M SLG Stock Missing (February 25, 2025)
   - Systematic asset stripping
   - Same stock supplied by Adderory
   - Transfer pricing fraud evidence

5. **EVENT_029** - Cloud IT Systems Removal (April 22, 2025)
   - Infrastructure control seizure
   - Between bank letter and audit trail destruction

**Impact:** Enhanced temporal coverage, demonstrated long-term planning, strengthened evidence chain.

## Key Insights Discovered

### 1. Long-Term Conspiracy Planning (4 Years)

The discovery of Adderory company registration in **April 2021** reveals systematic pre-planning **4 years before** the May 2025 fraud escalation. This significantly strengthens the case for premeditated, coordinated fraud.

**Timeline:**
- April 2021: Adderory companies registered
- 2021-2024: Infrastructure development
- March 2025: Fraud execution begins
- May 2025: Fraud escalation

### 2. Complete Family Conspiracy Network

The addition of PERSON_003 completes the family conspiracy network:

```
PERSON_001 (Peter) ─────┬───── Primary Perpetrator
                        │
PERSON_002 (Rynette) ───┼───── Co-conspirator, Financial Controller
                        │
PERSON_003 (Son) ───────┴───── Accomplice, Company Owner, Domain Registrant
                        │
PERSON_007 (Bantjies) ──┴───── Co-conspirator, Accountant, Trustee
```

### 3. Multi-Entity Fraud Structure

The separation of ReZonance from Adderory clarifies the fraud structure:

**Victim Side:**
- ReZonance (ORG_008): IT services provider, owed R1,035,361.34

**Perpetrator Side:**
- Adderory (ORG_009): Competing business, stock supplier, domain owner
- Adderory Skin (ORG_010): Competing business, customer hijacking

### 4. Estate Exploitation Pattern

The addition of Kayla murder (2023) and Chantal letter (January 2025) reveals a parallel estate exploitation pattern running alongside revenue hijacking.

### 5. Systematic Asset Stripping

EVENT_028 (February 25, 2025) provides crucial evidence of systematic asset stripping through transfer pricing fraud:
- R5.2M stock disappeared from SLG
- Same stock type supplied by Adderory
- Coordinated between multiple perpetrators
