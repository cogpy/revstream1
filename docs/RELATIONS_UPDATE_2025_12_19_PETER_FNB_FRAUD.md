#### Legal Implications

## Mandate Structure Analysis

### Independent Director Mandate

**Current Mandate:** "Any director may act independently of each other"

#### Structural Vulnerability
This mandate structure creates systematic vulnerability:
1. **No Consensus Required:** Single director can act unilaterally
2. **No Safeguards:** No checks on director abuse
3. **Bank Immunity:** FNB hides behind mandate to avoid accountability
4. **Obstruction Enablement:** Facilitates systematic financial abuse

#### Exploitation Pattern
Peter exploited this structure to:
- Block Jacqui's card without consent (June 12)
- Make false fraud allegations (June 17)
- Obstruct legitimate oversight
- Create false narrative to justify obstruction

#### FNB's Position
FNB refused to address the structural vulnerability:
- "Cannot be held liable for acting per validly signed mandate"
- Suggested directors "change mandate themselves"
- Cancelled meeting to avoid accountability
- Enabled continued abuse

## Cross-Reference with Existing Evidence

### Connection to Bantjies/Ketoni Debt (R18.75M)

The Peter FNB fraud letter pattern (June 2025) occurred in the context of:
- **Bantjies's R18.75M debt** (Ketoni to Faucitt Family Trust)
- **Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status** (appointed July 2024)
- **Bantjies's dismissal of audit request** (June 10, 2025 - EVENT_087)

#### Timeline Integration
- **June 6, 2025:** Daniel reports fraud to Bantjies (EVENT_086)
- **June 10, 2025:** Bantjies dismisses audit request (EVENT_087)
- **June 12, 2025:** Peter blocks Jacqui's card (EVENT_092)
- **June 17, 2025:** Peter writes fraud letter to FNB (EVENT_093)
- **June 18, 2025:** FNB refuses investigation (EVENT_094)

#### Coordinated Obstruction
The timeline reveals coordinated obstruction across multiple actors:
1. **Bantjies:** Dismisses audit (June 10) - R18.75M motive
2. **Peter:** Blocks Jacqui's card (June 12) - prevents oversight
3. **Peter:** False fraud letter (June 17) - creates false narrative
4. **FNB:** Refuses investigation (June 18) - institutional obstruction
