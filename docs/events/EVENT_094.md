## Overview

On June 18, 2025, FNB Business Relationship Manager Mpumi Netshipale correctly refused Peter Faucitt's attempt to weaponize the bank against other directors. After Peter's fraud letter attempting to get FNB to block Jax & Dan from the account, FNB consulted their legal department and properly upheld the mandate allowing all directors independent access. This demonstrates Peter's willingness to manipulate external institutions, but also shows his obstruction attempt was so egregious even the bank refused to comply.

## Analysis

### FNB Acted Properly
FNB's response demonstrates proper banking practice:
- Refused to act on unsubstantiated fraud allegations
- Consulted legal department before excluding directors
- Upheld "validly signed mandate" protecting all directors
- Prevented Peter from weaponizing bank against Jax & Dan

### Peter's Attempted Manipulation
Peter's fraud letter was an attempt to:
- Get FNB to block Jax & Dan from account access
- Use false fraud allegations as justification
- Weaponize external institution against other directors
- Circumvent mandate that protects all directors' rights

### Meeting Cancellation Was Appropriate
FNB cancelled the meeting because:
- Peter was attempting to manipulate them
- No legitimate basis for excluding other directors
- Mandate clearly allows all directors independent access
- Meeting would enable Peter's obstruction attempt

### Significance of FNB's Refusal
FNB's refusal demonstrates:
- Peter's obstruction attempt was egregious
- Even external institutions recognized manipulation
- False fraud allegations had no merit
- Peter willing to weaponize any available institution

## Legal Implications

### Peter's Attempted Manipulation
- False fraud allegations to external institution
- Attempt to weaponize bank against other directors
- Abuse of director authority
- Demonstrates pattern of false allegations

### FNB's Proper Response
- Correctly upheld mandate protecting all directors
- Refused to act on unsubstantiated allegations
- Consulted legal department appropriately
- Prevented institutional manipulation

### Significance for Case
- Shows Peter's obstruction attempts extend to external institutions
- Demonstrates false fraud allegations had no merit

## Burden of Proof

**Civil:** HIGH (email correspondence, official FNB response, timeline)  
**Criminal:** N/A (regulatory/civil matter)

## Mandate Context

**Current Mandate:** Any director may act independently  
**Implication:** Peter can block cards, make allegations, obstruct operations without other directors' consent  
**FNB Position:** Directors must change mandate themselves (no bank intervention)

## Significance

FNB's proper refusal to act on Peter's false fraud allegations demonstrates that Peter's obstruction attempt was so egregious even the bank recognized it as manipulation. By upholding the mandate that protects all directors' independent access, FNB prevented Peter from weaponizing the bank against Jax & Dan. This strengthens the case by showing Peter's willingness to manipulate external institutions and the lack of merit in his fraud allegations.
