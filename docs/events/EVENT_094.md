## Analysis

### Bank Negligence
FNB's response demonstrates institutional negligence:
- Refused to investigate formal fraud allegations
- Cancelled meeting after legal consultation
- Hid behind "validly signed mandate" defense
- Enabled continued financial abuse

### "Validly Signed Mandate" Defense
FNB's defense is problematic:
- Mandate allows any director to act independently
- No requirement for director consensus
- Enables abuse by single director
- Bank refuses accountability

### Institutional Obstruction
FNB's actions constitute institutional obstruction:
- Formal fraud allegations ignored
- Meeting cancelled to avoid accountability
- Legal department consulted to find excuse
- Directors told to "change mandate" themselves

### Enablement of Fraud
The independent director mandate enabled:
- Peter to block Jacqui's card without consent
- Peter to make false fraud allegations
- Continued obstruction without bank intervention
- Systematic financial abuse

## Legal Implications

### Bank Negligence
- Failure to investigate fraud allegations
- Cancellation of meeting to avoid accountability
- Hiding behind mandate defense
- Enabling financial abuse

### Mandate Structure Issues
- "Any director may act independently" enables abuse
- No safeguards against single director obstruction
- Bank refuses to address structural vulnerability
- Systematic obstruction facilitated

### Regulatory Violations
- Potential FICA violations (failure to investigate)
- Bank duty of care breached
- Enabling of financial crimes

## Burden of Proof

**Civil:** HIGH (email correspondence, official FNB response, timeline)  
**Criminal:** N/A (regulatory/civil matter)

## Mandate Context

**Current Mandate:** Any director may act independently  
**Implication:** Peter can block cards, make allegations, obstruct operations without other directors' consent  
**FNB Position:** Directors must change mandate themselves (no bank intervention)

## Significance

FNB's refusal to investigate demonstrates how institutional obstruction enabled Peter's false fraud allegations and systematic financial abuse. The "validly signed mandate" defense allowed the bank to avoid accountability while facilitating continued obstruction.
