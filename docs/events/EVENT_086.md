# Daniel reports fraud to Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator)

**Event ID:** EVENT_086  
**Date:** 2025-06-06  
**Category:** fraud_exposure

## Description

Daniel Faucitt reported the Villa Via fraud discovery to Danie Bantjies, unaware that Bantjies was:
1. An undisclosed trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust
2. A debtor owing R18,685,000 to the trust
3. The accountant with control over all financial systems
4. A party with significant motive to prevent fraud discovery

This was a critical turning point where Daniel unknowingly reported fraud to a conflicted party who had R18.685M reasons to suppress the investigation.
