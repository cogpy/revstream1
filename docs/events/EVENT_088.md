# Bantjies certifies Peter's affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths

**Event ID:** EVENT_088  
**Date:** 2025-08-01 (estimated)  
**Category:** professional_misconduct

## Description

Danie Bantjies, acting as Commissioner of Oaths, certified Peter Faucitt's founding affidavit for the interdict application against Jacqui and Daniel. This certification constituted professional misconduct because:

1. **Material Omissions:** The affidavit omitted Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status
2. **Conflict Concealment:** The affidavit omitted Bantjies's R18,685,000 debt to the trust
3. **Personal Benefit:** The affidavit sought to remove oversight by beneficiaries investigating fraud
4. **Ethical Breach:** Commissioner certified document that directly benefited his conflicted position

## Professional Misconduct Analysis

### Commissioner of Oaths Duties

A Commissioner of Oaths must:
- Ensure affidavits contain truthful statements
- Maintain independence and impartiality
- Disclose conflicts of interest
- Not certify documents where personally conflicted

### Violations

Bantjies violated these duties by:
1. Certifying affidavit omitting his own trustee status
2. Certifying affidavit omitting his own debt to the trust
3. Certifying affidavit that directly benefited his position
4. Using official capacity to facilitate obstruction of fraud investigation

## Legal Implications

### Abuse of Commissioner Authority

- Certification gave false legitimacy to deceptive application
- Misuse of official capacity for personal benefit
- Facilitation of fraud concealment

### Breach of Fiduciary Duty

- As trustee, should have disclosed conflicts
- As trustee, should have supported fraud investigation
- As trustee, should not have supported removal of oversight

## Timeline Context

**2 months earlier:** Bantjies dismissed Daniel's audit request (EVENT_087)  
**13 days later:** Interdict granted against Jacqui and Daniel (August 13, 2025)

## Significance

This certification demonstrates:
1. **Systematic abuse** of professional positions
2. **Coordination** with Peter to remove oversight
3. **Escalation** from dismissing audit to facilitating legal action
4. **Pattern** of using official capacities to conceal fraud
