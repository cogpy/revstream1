**To:** Nondu Motlhala (FNB)  
**Subject:** Issuing replacement cards - Account number: 62323196362  
**Date:** 17 June 2025

### Key Allegations

**1. Suspected Fraud**
> "Following my recent written request to cancel the 3 x debit cards on the above account due to suspected fraud, I now believe that you intend to issue one or more replacement cards which may allow the perpetuation of the suspected fraud before any internal or external investigation of my allegations can be carried out by our auditors."

**2. FNB Liability Warning**
> "This action may place FNB in the untenable position of being an accessory after the fact, should such fraud be proven by any subsequent investigations, and may hold FNB liable for any future losses incurred by our company due to the re-issuance of these cards."

**3. Exchange Control Regulations**
> "I also believe that due to the amount of dollar-based subscription expense passing through this account our company may be transgressing the Exchange Control Regulations, and if so, any such internation remittances should be suspended forthwith."

**4. Request for Swift Response**
> "I would appreciate your swift response to my request forthwith."

**5. Legal Advice Suggestion**
> "I strongly advise that you speak to your legal department before such action is taken."

### Exchange Control Regulations Pretext
The Exchange Control Regulations allegation appears to be a pretext to:
- Freeze legitimate business operations

The letter uses legal intimidation tactics:
- Warning FNB of accessory liability
- Suggesting FNB consult legal department
