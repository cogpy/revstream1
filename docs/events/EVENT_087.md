# Bantjies dismisses Daniel's audit request

**Event ID:** EVENT_087  
**Date:** 2025-06-10  
**Category:** obstruction

## Description

Four days after Daniel reported the fraud to Bantjies, Bantjies dismissed Daniel's request for an independent audit. This dismissal occurred despite:
1. Clear evidence of R22.8M in unexplained Villa Via transactions
2. Bantjies's fiduciary duty as trustee to investigate fraud
3. Bantjies's professional duty as accountant to ensure accurate records
4. Daniel's status as a trust beneficiary with legitimate concerns

## Evidence References

- **SF1:** Bantjies Debt Documentation - See ad-res-j7/ANNEXURES/SF1_Bantjies_Debt_Documentation.md

## Entities Involved

- [PERSON_007 - Danie Bantjies](../entities/PERSON_007.md)
- [PERSON_003 - Daniel Faucitt](../entities/PERSON_003.md)
- [TRUST_001 - Faucitt Family Trust](../entities/TRUST_001.md)

## Financial Impact

**R18,685,000** - Bantjies's personal debt providing motive to prevent audit

## Burden of Proof Assessment

- **Civil Standard (Balance of Probabilities):** HIGH
- **Criminal Standard (Beyond Reasonable Doubt):** HIGH
- **Evidence Type:** Documentary, correspondence, conflict of interest analysis

## Significance

This dismissal demonstrates:
1. **Breach of fiduciary duty** - Trustee refusing to investigate fraud
2. **Conflict of interest** - R18.685M debt creating motive to suppress investigation
3. **Obstruction** - Preventing legitimate oversight by beneficiaries
4. **Pattern establishment** - Beginning of systematic obstruction

## Motive Analysis

Bantjies had R18,685,000 reasons to prevent an audit:
- Audit would likely discover his undisclosed trustee status
- Audit would reveal his massive debt to the trust
- Audit would expose the control structure
- Audit would threaten his position and ability to manage the debt

## Timeline Context

**4 days earlier:** Daniel reported fraud to Bantjies (EVENT_086)  
**2 months later:** Bantjies certifies Peter's affidavit (EVENT_088)
