As an emergency measure the expenses were put on the Worldwide cards which had a different expiry date. This is why RegimA Skin Treatments and Strategic have no record of their actual computer expenses. Eerything was dumped in Worldwide. The majority of these tranasactions belong in Rezonance, a technology and IT company Kayla and I spent nearly a decade building. As an IT company and service provider, the operating expenses are essentially different from a skincare distribution company, so an operating expense for the former would often be considered capital expenditure in the latter etc. As you can see from the ProfitandLoss.pdf Rezonance made its first annual profit in Feb 2023 which Kayla and I celebrated as all the hard work finally paying off. Rezonance currently owes me ZAR 1.8 million as a director from my investments over the years, you can understand why I firmly rejected Pete's insistence that I just close the company. In addition there was an ongoing murder investigation where the authorities reminded me of the familiar firearms rule that life comes before property and instructed me to freeze all activity immediately while they conducted their investigations and resolve the financial issues later. Which is exactly what I have done.\n\n\tFurther to the question of necessity to the business, as can be seen from the ProfitandLossReport (RWD).pdf RegimA Worldwide Distribution absorbed the operational overhead of 4 large distribution partners between 2020 and 2023. It did so with no additional staff as I single-handedly rebuilt the entire demand side of the distribution function into the marketplace and ecommerce platforms to allow continuity of business in the wake of cascading failure of our distribution partners. The margins are structured so that each hub uses its margin to cover the costs. The recent moves to take all of the payments directly into an account which only Rynette has access to and deny me any visibility while leaving all the expenses with me are not only bizarre but will ultimately prevent us from ever being able to resolve anything while placing someone who is neither a director or employee of Worldwide Distribution in complete control without any liability. This is conerning as it makes me as a director liable for their actions without my knowledge or consent. This cannot continue.\n\n\tAs can be seen in the Worldwide Distribution P&L, the year-on-year turnover increase from 2M to 12M to 19M reflects the additional distribution activity it took on over the period.\n\tThe significant drop of 1M to 18M the following year was after Pete signed an affidavit to make himself the administrator on the Worldwide accounts and all my automations were unhooked. I informed Pete and Rynette prior to this not to touch it or it would break the automations but they did so anyway. I informed them after that I could no longer see the things i needed to complete the accounts and that they need to ensure they know what they are doing. Over the past year the bank contacted me on several occasions to ask for my approval where Pete and Rynette had attempted to draft mandates to change the ownership structure, have my accounts closed and cancel my cards, all without my knowledge or consent. I informed the bank these must be errors and informed both Pete and Rynette to cease this activity immediately.\n\n\tAs you can see in AccountTransactionsReport.pdf the correct format up to Aug 2023 shows invoices from Rezonance which group the services with itemized billing. This involves a 10% mark-up for Rezonance managed services which I use to also cover the account processing where I have a system that remunerates R50 for whoever is managing the 3rd party service for each invoice, ensuring its line items, forex rates etc are correctly filled in on quickbooks for comprehensive records. After Aug 2023 you can see all items are allocated to FNB which is the auto bank feed i have on Worldwide accounts. \n\n\tThe actual companies RegimA Zone and RegimA SA that operate the Shopify systems were configured to operate the distribution functions using trust accounts and RegimA SA with Pete and I as directors was doing this with Dermal (Barend) and RegimA Zone (Only me as director) was an aggregation of 3 smaller distributions. I had specifically structured it this way to prevent Pete from doing to me what he did to Kachan, simply taking the revenue for himself by instructing people to pay into another account (which is basically what has happened). The problem is that since the ownership of the companies is not the same (i.e. I am not a member of RegimA Skin Treatments and the other companies are not subsidiaries), therefore there is no fixed \"group\" or intercompany and moving assets from a company where I am a director to a company where I am not is essentially theft or at the very least fraudulent for tax purposes. I urge you to keep this in mind as these issues should not be dismissed as \"family disputes\" when there is a distinct material and legal difference between ownership of companies which should be treated as such.\n\n\tI have been telling both Pete and Rynette for 4 years now that the outstanding amounts owed to Rezonance need to be paid before I am able to purchase the services and continue as normal, attached is the Rezonance Febr 2023.PDF showing over 1M outstanding owed by RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance. I have been telling Pete for over a year that I cannot file the accounts for Rezonance until the errors of 2024 are corrected in RegimA Skin Treatments. RST has had an account with GoDaddy since 2014 which is also an international payments account with some forex etc. For reasons I can only speculate, in 2024 Rynette made the debt to Rezonance \"disappear\" by misallocating international GoDaddy payments as though they were local payments made to Rezonance, yet Rezonance received no such payments (the amounts are still outstanding). I was explaining to Pete that these need to be corrected before I submit Rezonance accounts as there will immediately be a mismatch showing Rezonance never received the payments and they will flag as fraudulent on RegimA Skin Treatments with SARS. This was just ignored and they opted instead to try and close my accounts and dissolve my company. This cannot continue.\n\n\tTo the best of my understanding the course we need to follow for correct accounts is:\n\n\t1.\tInform SARS about my freezing activity on the accounts in cooperaion with law enforcement for the murder inquiry\n\t2.\tExplain that we are now in the process of updating the affected records to reconcile the past 2 years so it reflects an accurate account\n\t3.\tMake the payments from RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance and correctly allocate the 2014 GoDaddy expenses to GoDaddy\n\t4.\tProcess the Invoices in the same way I had been doing up until Aug 2023 so there is a single invoice from Rezonance each month.\n\t5.\tConfigure the Paystack systems on Shopify to split the payments directly into Distrivbution and Manufacturer accounts.\n\n\tOther than that I can't see any other way to properly remedy the situation. We cannot just try to shoehorn an entire architecture for multiple distribution operations into one account. The transactions on RegimA Skin Treatments must not be signed off as they will later show up as fraudulent. Bear in mind that Pete does not use the computer and has never seen the actual accounts for the company, nor has Jacqui and nor have I. They exist solely on Rynette's computer and nobody else is able to see them. The amounts I can see going through Strategic and RegimA Skin Treatments seem off the charts so we need an internal audit with extreme urgency to see what is going on there.\n\n\tWarm Regards,\n\tDan\n\n________________________________\n\tFrom: Danie Bantjes <danie.bantjes@gmail.com <mailto:danie.bantjes@gmail.com> >\n\tSent: 10 June 2025 09:58\n\tTo: Peter Andrew Faucitt <pete@regima.com <mailto:pete@regima.com> >; Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone <mailto:jax@regima.zone> >; Daniel Faucitt <d@rzo.io <mailto:d@rzo.io> >\n\tSubject: The RegimA Group results and Computer Expense analysis\n\n\tGood morning Pete, Jacqui and Danny\n\n\tIt saddens me to write this email this morning, as in my 30-odd year involvement with the Faucitt family business I have never had to encounter or get involved with an internal dispute of this serious nature. \n\n\tAlthough perhaps difficult for you as family members, I suggest we try and keep the emotions at bay and resolve this dispute regarding the spend on Computer related expenses by applying basic business principles in deciding what needs to be done to restore the profitability and ultimate survival of the business going forward.

It is a lot to digest.

For any business to spend in excess of 20% of revenue generated on these services, the spend needs to be justified, transparent, relevant and needs to add the desired value to the business, i.e. it has to benefit the \"bottom line\".\n\n\tInsofar as these computer expenses are concerned, I suggest we need to ask ourselves these questions to start off with:\n\t1. Do we have the necessary invoices for each expense to be able to satisfy a SARS investigation?\n\t2. Verify what each expense is used for on a daily basis?\n\t3. Confirm the sales volume and value generated by each and every e-commerce platform the company is paying for.\n\t4. Consider the relevance and necessity of all collaboration, communication, marketing, development , AI services as well as Analytics & Monitoring tools and do a cost-benefit analysis.on each and every service paid for.\n\n\tThe other concerning aspect is that from my high-level analysis of the state of the finances of the RegimA Group as at 28 February 2025, it is concerning to notice that the Group has, for the first time in its history, made a substantial trading loss in the past financial year. \n\n\tThis reflects in the bank balances as well, which saw a decline of R10m year-on-year for the Group, including Villa Via. \n\n\tSo, besides considering Computer Expenses, other aspects of the business like product margins, selling and distribution costs etc. needs to be looked at in depth again.\n\n\tThis will hopefully be the start of an in-depth discussion regarding the profitability and ultimate future viability of the business.\n\n\tKind regards,\n\n\tDanie Bantjes",

Rezonance currently owes me ZAR 1.8 million as a director from my investments over the years, you can understand why I firmly rejected Pete's insistence that I just close the company. In addition there was an ongoing murder investigation where the authorities reminded me of the familiar firearms rule that life comes before property and instructed me to freeze all activity immediately while they conducted their investigations and resolve the financial issues later. Which is exactly what I have done.\nFurther to the question of necessity to the business, as can be seen from the ProfitandLossReport (RWD).pdf RegimA Worldwide Distribution absorbed the operational overhead of 4 large distribution partners between 2020 and 2023. It did so with no additional staff as I single-handedly rebuilt the entire demand side of the distribution function into the marketplace and ecommerce platforms to allow continuity of business in the wake of cascading failure of our distribution partners. The margins are structured so that each hub uses its margin to cover the costs. The recent moves to take all of the payments directly into an account which only Rynette has access to and deny me any visibility while leaving all the expenses with me are not only bizarre but will ultimately prevent us from ever being able to resolve anything while placing someone who is neither a director or employee of Worldwide Distribution in complete control without any liability. This is conerning as it makes me as a director liable for their actions without my knowledge or consent. This cannot continue.\nAs can be seen in the Worldwide Distribution P&L, the year-on-year turnover increase from 2M to 12M to 19M reflects the additional distribution activity it took on over the period.\nThe significant drop of 1M to 18M the following year was after Pete signed an affidavit to make himself the administrator on the Worldwide accounts and all my automations were unhooked. I informed Pete and Rynette prior to this not to touch it or it would break the automations but they did so anyway. I informed them after that I could no longer see the things i needed to complete the accounts and that they need to ensure they know what they are doing. Over the past year the bank contacted me on several occasions to ask for my approval where Pete and Rynette had attempted to draft mandates to change the ownership structure, have my accounts closed and cancel my cards, all without my knowledge or consent. I informed the bank these must be errors and informed both Pete and Rynette to cease this activity immediately.\nAs you can see in AccountTransactionsReport.pdf the correct format up to Aug 2023 shows invoices from Rezonance which group the services with itemized billing. This involves a 10% mark-up for Rezonance managed services which I use to also cover the account processing where I have a system that remunerates R50 for whoever is managing the 3rd party service for each invoice, ensuring its line items, forex rates etc are correctly filled in on quickbooks for comprehensive records. After Aug 2023 you can see all items are allocated to FNB which is the auto bank feed i have on Worldwide accounts. \nThe actual companies RegimA Zone and RegimA SA that operate the Shopify systems were configured to operate the distribution functions using trust accounts and RegimA SA with Pete and I as directors was doing this with Dermal (Barend) and RegimA Zone (Only me as director) was an aggregation of 3 smaller distributions. I had specifically structured it this way to prevent Pete from doing to me what he did to Kachan, simply taking the revenue for himself by instructing people to pay into another account (which is basically what has happened). The problem is that since the ownership of the companies is not the same (i.e. I am not a member of RegimA Skin Treatments and the other companies are not subsidiaries), therefore there is no fixed \"group\" or intercompany and moving assets from a company where I am a director to a company where I am not is essentially theft or at the very least fraudulent for tax purposes. I urge you to keep this in mind as these issues should not be dismissed as \"family disputes\" when there is a distinct material and legal difference between ownership of companies which should be treated as such.\nI have been telling both Pete and Rynette for 4 years now that the outstanding amounts owed to Rezonance need to be paid before I am able to purchase the services and continue as normal, attached is the Rezonance Febr 2023.PDF showing over 1M outstanding owed by RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance. I have been telling Pete for over a year that I cannot file the accounts for Rezonance until the errors of 2024 are corrected in RegimA Skin Treatments. RST has had an account with GoDaddy since 2014 which is also an international payments account with some forex etc. For reasons I can only speculate, in 2024 Rynette made the debt to Rezonance \"disappear\" by misallocating international GoDaddy payments as though they were local payments made to Rezonance, yet Rezonance received no such payments (the amounts are still outstanding). I was explaining to Pete that these need to be corrected before I submit Rezonance accounts as there will immediately be a mismatch showing Rezonance never received the payments and they will flag as fraudulent on RegimA Skin Treatments with SARS. This was just ignored and they opted instead to try and close my accounts and dissolve my company. This cannot continue.\nTo the best of my understanding the course we need to follow for correct accounts is:\n\n1.\t\n\tInform SARS about my freezing activity on the accounts in cooperaion with law enforcement for the murder inquiry\n2.\t\n\tExplain that we are now in the process of updating the affected records to reconcile the past 2 years so it reflects an accurate account\n3.\t\n\tMake the payments from RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance and correctly allocate the 2014 GoDaddy expenses to GoDaddy\n4.\t\n\tProcess the Invoices in the same way I had been doing up until Aug 2023 so there is a single invoice from Rezonance each month.\n5.\t\n\tConfigure the Paystack systems on Shopify to split the payments directly into Distrivbution and Manufacturer accounts.\n\nOther than that I can't see any other way to properly remedy the situation. We cannot just try to shoehorn an entire architecture for multiple distribution operations into one account. The transactions on RegimA Skin Treatments must not be signed off as they will later show up as fraudulent. Bear in mind that Pete does not use the computer and has never seen the actual accounts for the company, nor has Jacqui and nor have I. They exist solely on Rynette's computer and nobody else is able to see them. The amounts I can see going through Strategic and RegimA Skin Treatments seem off the charts so we need an internal audit with extreme urgency to see what is going on there.\nWarm Regards,\nDan\n________________________________\nFrom: Danie Bantjes <danie.bantjes@gmail.com>\nSent: 10 June 2025 09:58\nTo: Peter Andrew Faucitt <pete@regima.com>; Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>; Daniel Faucitt <d@rzo.io>\nSubject: The RegimA Group results and Computer Expense analysis\nGood morning Pete, Jacqui and Danny\nIt saddens me to write this email this morning, as in my 30-odd year involvement with the Faucitt family business I have never had to encounter or get involved with an internal dispute of this serious nature. \nAlthough perhaps difficult for you as family members, I suggest we try and keep the emotions at bay and resolve this dispute regarding the spend on Computer related expenses by applying basic business principles in deciding what needs to be done to restore the profitability and ultimate survival of the business going forward.

After Aug 2023 you can see all items are allocated to FNB which is the auto bank feed i have on Worldwide accounts. \n\tThe actual companies RegimA Zone and RegimA SA that operate the Shopify systems were configured to operate the distribution functions using trust accounts and RegimA SA with Pete and I as directors was doing this with Dermal (Barend) and RegimA Zone (Only me as director) was an aggregation of 3 smaller distributions. I had specifically structured it this way to prevent Pete from doing to me what he did to Kachan, simply taking the revenue for himself by instructing people to pay into another account (which is basically what has happened). The problem is that since the ownership of the companies is not the same (i.e. I am not a member of RegimA Skin Treatments and the other companies are not subsidiaries), therefore there is no fixed \"group\" or intercompany and moving assets from a company where I am a director to a company where I am not is essentially theft or at the very least fraudulent for tax purposes. I urge you to keep this in mind as these issues should not be dismissed as \"family disputes\" when there is a distinct material and legal difference between ownership of companies which should be treated as such.\n\tI have been telling both Pete and Rynette for 4 years now that the outstanding amounts owed to Rezonance need to be paid before I am able to purchase the services and continue as normal, attached is the Rezonance Febr 2023.PDF showing over 1M outstanding owed by RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance. I have been telling Pete for over a year that I cannot file the accounts for Rezonance until the errors of 2024 are corrected in RegimA Skin Treatments. RST has had an account with GoDaddy since 2014 which is also an international payments account with some forex etc. For reasons I can only speculate, in 2024 Rynette made the debt to Rezonance \"disappear\" by misallocating international GoDaddy payments as though they were local payments made to Rezonance, yet Rezonance received no such payments (the amounts are still outstanding). I was explaining to Pete that these need to be corrected before I submit Rezonance accounts as there will immediately be a mismatch showing Rezonance never received the payments and they will flag as fraudulent on RegimA Skin Treatments with SARS. This was just ignored and they opted instead to try and close my accounts and dissolve my company. This cannot continue.\n\tTo the best of my understanding the course we need to follow for correct accounts is:\n\n\t1.\t\n\t\tInform SARS about my freezing activity on the accounts in cooperaion with law enforcement for the murder inquiry\n\t2.\t\n\t\tExplain that we are now in the process of updating the affected records to reconcile the past 2 years so it reflects an accurate account\n\t3.\t\n\t\tMake the payments from RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance and correctly allocate the 2014 GoDaddy expenses to GoDaddy\n\t4.\t\n\t\tProcess the Invoices in the same way I had been doing up until Aug 2023 so there is a single invoice from Rezonance each month.\n\t5.\t\n\t\tConfigure the Paystack systems on Shopify to split the payments directly into Distrivbution and Manufacturer accounts.\n\n\tOther than that I can't see any other way to properly remedy the situation. We cannot just try to shoehorn an entire architecture for multiple distribution operations into one account. The transactions on RegimA Skin Treatments must not be signed off as they will later show up as fraudulent. Bear in mind that Pete does not use the computer and has never seen the actual accounts for the company, nor has Jacqui and nor have I. They exist solely on Rynette's computer and nobody else is able to see them. The amounts I can see going through Strategic and RegimA Skin Treatments seem off the charts so we need an internal audit with extreme urgency to see what is going on there.\n\tWarm Regards,\n\tDan\n________________________________\n\tFrom: Danie Bantjes <danie.bantjes@gmail.com <mailto:danie.bantjes@gmail.com> >\n\tSent: 10 June 2025 09:58\n\tTo: Peter Andrew Faucitt <pete@regima.com <mailto:pete@regima.com> >; Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>; Daniel Faucitt <d@rzo.io <mailto:d@rzo.io> >\n\tSubject: The RegimA Group results and Computer Expense analysis\n\tGood morning Pete, Jacqui and Danny\n\tIt saddens me to write this email this morning, as in my 30-odd year involvement with the Faucitt family business I have never had to encounter or get involved with an internal dispute of this serious nature. \n\tAlthough perhaps difficult for you as family members, I suggest we try and keep the emotions at bay and resolve this dispute regarding the spend on Computer related expenses by applying basic business principles in deciding what needs to be done to restore the profitability and ultimate survival of the business going forward. What do you think?\n\tJust a friendly request please, not to send me any relevant information and comments privately. We all need to be working as a team to be able to ascertain the potential problem/s and focus on finding the most viable solution/s.\n\tDanny has responded to my email of 26th May, his email attached. Danny, many thanks for the very professional and detailed analyses you have provided. \n\tI would still like for the Excel printouts I've attached to be answered line by line please.\n\tYour email contains a lot of information. It is a lot to digest. By doing a category analysis helps tremendously to understand the nature and purpose of all the various IT related services and platforms that are used throughout the RegimA Group. \n\tI am neither an IT expert, nor am I an e-Commerce expert so I would not be able to comment on the necessity, use and value each expense adds to the company. \n\tWhat is clear though, is that the RegimA group has over the past few years invested heavily in IT and e-commerce platforms and continues to do so. For any business to spend in excess of 20% of revenue generated on these services, the spend needs to be justified, transparent, relevant and needs to add the desired value to the business, i.e. it has to benefit the \"bottom line\".\n\tInsofar as these computer expenses are concerned, I suggest we need to ask ourselves these questions to start off with:\n\t1. Do we have the necessary invoices for each expense to be able to satisfy a SARS investigation?\n\t2. Verify what each expense is used for on a daily basis?\n\t3. Confirm the sales volume and value generated by each and every e-commerce platform the company is paying for.\n\t4. Consider the relevance and necessity of all collaboration, communication, marketing, development , AI services as well as Analytics & Monitoring tools and do a cost-benefit analysis.on each and every service paid for.\n\tThe other concerning aspect is that from my high-level analysis of the state of the finances of the RegimA Group as at 28 February 2025, it is concerning to notice that the Group has, for the first time in its history, made a substantial trading loss in the past financial year. \n\tThis reflects in the bank balances as well, which saw a decline of R10m year-on-year for the Group, including Villa Via. \n\tSo, besides considering Computer Expenses, other aspects of the business like product margins, selling and distribution costs etc. needs to be looked at in depth again.\n\tThis will hopefully be the start of an in-depth discussion regarding the profitability and ultimate future viability of the business.\n\n\tKind regards,\n\tDanie Bantjes",

Introduction as co-trustee and beneficiary\n2. Fulfillment of fiduciary duty by investigating debt\n3. Discovery of false statements and conflicts\n4. Systematic retaliation after inquiry\n5. Deception by co-trustees\n6. Punishment for fulfilling trustee duties\n7. Support for setting aside ex parte order\n### Daniel's Narrative (Operations & Beneficiary Perspective)\n**Core Theme:** Building profitable operations, exposing fraud, and systematic sabotage\n**Primary Evidence Allocation:**\n- E-commerce operations (51+ Shopify stores, R34.9M revenue)\n- UK funding evidence (Shopify invoices, bank transactions)\n- Expense dumping trap (30 Mar 2025)\n- Villa Via fraud exposure (6 June 2025)\n- Card cancellation sabotage (7 June 2025, day after cooperation)\n- Unauthorized R900K transfers (14-15 Feb 2025)\n- Revenue diversion scheme (1 Mar, 14 Apr, 11 Sep)\n- Warehouse sabotage (8 July 2025)\n- Six-month sabotage campaign\n- Continued creditor payments despite sabotage\n**Narrative Arc:**\n1. Introduction as beneficiary and operations director\n2. Building profitable e-commerce operations with Kayla\n3. Cooperation with accountant to expose fraud\n4. Immediate retaliation (card cancellation day after)\n5. Systematic financial sabotage\n6. Continued operations despite sabotage\n7. Support for counter-delinquency application\n---\n## Cognitive Synergy Points\n### Point 1: Timeline Convergence\n- **Jax:** 15 May confrontation \u2192 22 May data expungement (7 days) \u2192 29 May domain theft (14 days)\n- **Dan:** 6 June fraud exposure \u2192 7 June card cancellation (1 day) \u2192 10 June audit dismissal (4 days)\n- **Synergy:** Both timelines show immediate retaliation after investigating/exposing fraud\n### Point 2: Bantjies's Multiple Roles\n- **Jax:** Discovers Bantjies is undisclosed trustee, learns of debt to trust\n- **Dan:** Reports fraud to Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator), receives audit dismissal\n- **Synergy:** Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery\n### Point 3: Rynette's Control Structure\n- **Jax:** Rynette made false statement about debt, facilitated \"Main Trustee\" document\n- **Dan:** Rynette controlled systems using Peter's email, claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions\n- **Synergy:** Rynette operated under Bantjies's instructions, not Peter's\n### Point 4: Adderory's Role\n- **Jax:** Domain regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory 14 days after confrontation\n- **Dan:** R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics, same type supplied by Adderory\n- **Synergy:** Rynette's son's company benefited from both domain theft and stock transfer pricing\n### Point 5: Manufactured Crisis\n- **Jax:** Substituted personal card to prevent business collapse after Peter's card cancellation\n- **Dan:** Card cancellation occurred day after cooperation, rendered documentation inaccessible\n- **Synergy:** Peter created the crisis he complains about (venire contra factum proprium)\n### Point 6: UK Operations Truth\n- **Jax:** Aware of UK company's role in funding operations\n- **Dan:** Provides Shopify invoices and UK bank transactions proving UK \u2192 SA payment flow\n- **Synergy:** Peter's claim that UK owes SA is demonstrably false (perjury)\n### Point 7: Kayla's Estate\n- **Jax:** R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate, \"profiting from proceeds of murder\"\n- **Dan:** Kayla co-built R34.9M operations, murdered 13 July 2023, email seized by court order\n- **Synergy:** Debt to murdered partner's estate unpaid while operations sabotaged\n### Point 8: Punishment Pattern\n- **Jax:** Included in interdict 2 days after signing document, 3 months after debt inquiry\n- **Dan:** Six-month sabotage campaign after fraud exposure\n- **Synergy:** Both punished by co-trustees for fulfilling duties\n---\n## AD Paragraph Response Strategy\n### Sections 1-3: Parties and Structure (AD 1-6.5)\n- **Jax:** Trust structure, trustee relationships, beneficiary status\n- **Dan:** Corporate structure, directorship roles, operational responsibilities\n- **Both:** Confirm accurate information, note omissions\n### Section 4: Urgency and Misconduct (AD 7-7.20)\n- **Jax:** Timeline of retaliation after debt inquiry, personal card substitution\n- **Dan:** Timeline of sabotage after fraud exposure, operational impact\n- **Both:** Refute urgency claims, establish manufactured crisis\n### Section 5: Financial Discrepancies (AD 8.4-9.3)\n- **Jax:** Bantjies's conflicts, two years unallocated expenses\n- **Dan:** IT expenses context (R34.9M revenue), UK funding evidence\n- **Both:** Refute \"unexplainable\" expenses claim\n### Section 6: Delinquency Application (AD 10.1-10.14)\n- **Jax:** Fulfillment of trustee duties, Peter's breach of fiduciary duty to beneficiaries\n- **Dan:** Unauthorized R900K transfers, systematic sabotage, counter-delinquency grounds\n- **Both:** Support counter-application for Peter's delinquency\n### Section 7: UK Operations (AD 11.2-12.4)\n- **Jax:** Awareness of UK company's legitimate role\n- **Dan:** Shopify invoices, UK bank transactions, perjury evidence\n- **Both:** Refute UK debt claims with documentary evidence\n### Section 8: Interdictory Relief (AD 13.2-13.8)\n- **Jax:** No clear right (manufactured crisis), balance favors respondents\n- **Dan:** No injury not self-inflicted, alternative remedies available\n- **Both:** Support setting aside ex parte order\n### Section 9: Forensic Audit (AD 14.1-14.5)\n- **Jax:** Support independent audit, would reveal Bantjies's conflicts\n- **Dan:** Support independent audit, would reveal systematic fraud\n- **Both:** Welcome impartial forensic investigation\n### Section 10: Discovery and Urgency (AD 16.1-16.12)\n- **Jax:** Discovery was retaliation trigger, not genuine shock\n- **Dan:** Discovery was consciousness of guilt after fraud exposure\n- **Both:** Two-month delay contradicts urgency\n### Section 11: Ex Parte Basis (AD 17.3-17.4)\n- **Jax:** Material non-disclosures (Bantjies's trustee status, timeline)\n- **Dan:** Material non-disclosures (UK payment flow, revenue context, timeline)\n- **Both:** Abuse of ex parte process\n### Section 12: Remaining Paragraphs (AD 18.3, 20, 22, 40.9.4, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, 88)\n- **Jax:** Comprehensive denial of allegations, require strict proof\n- **Dan:** Comprehensive denial of allegations, require strict proof\n- **Both:** Establish Peter's burden of proof\n---\n## Tone and Style Guidelines\n### Professional Elegance\n- Formal but accessible language\n- Well-structured paragraphs\n- Clear topic sentences\n- Logical flow between sections\n- Appropriate legal terminology\n### Neutral Tone\n- Objective statements of fact\n- Evidence-based assertions\n- No hyperbolic language\n- No subjective characterizations\n- No speculative claims\n### Material Evidence Support\n- Every claim supported by annexure reference\n- Specific dates, amounts, and documents cited\n- Timeline analysis with documentary support\n- Financial figures from official records\n- Email correspondence and bank statements\n---\n## Annexure Strategy\n### Jacqueline's Annexures\n- JF1: Trust deed and trustee documentation\n- JF2: Email correspondence re R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025)\n- JF3: Rynette's false

INTRODUCTION AND CAPACITY\n1.1 I am the Second Respondent in this matter, an adult male, and a South African citizen.\n1.2 I am a Beneficiary of the Faucitt Family Trust (IT 3651/2013) and a co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (2017/087935/07) and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (2011/005722/07), both of which are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust.\n1.3 The facts deposed to in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and belief, save where the context indicates otherwise, and are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\n1.4 Where I make legal submissions, I do so on the advice of my legal representatives.\n---\n### 2. PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT\n2.1 This affidavit is filed in response to the Applicant's founding affidavit and the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025.\n2.2 I oppose the relief sought by the Applicant and seek to have the ex parte order set aside on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n2.3 I address each of the Applicant's allegations in the order they appear in the founding affidavit, following the AD paragraph sequence.\n---\n### 3. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 1-3.13: PARTIES AND STRUCTURE\n#### AD 1 - Director Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n3.1 The Applicant invokes provisions relating to director liability for breach of fiduciary duty. I built and managed 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually (Annexure **DF1**). The e-commerce operations were highly profitable under my management. The alleged breaches occurred after I cooperated with the Applicant's request to provide comprehensive reports to the accountant on 6 June 2025 (Annexure **DF3**).\n#### AD 1.3 - Applicant's Personal Details and Declaration\n3.2 The Applicant's personal details are noted. This affidavit was commissioned by Danie Jacobus Bantjies, identified as \"our accountant.\" On 6 June 2025, I provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies regarding Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC, which is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. I unknowingly reported fraud to one of the perpetrators.\n#### AD 2 - Company Business Conduct Requirements\n3.3 The Applicant alleges reckless or grossly negligent business conduct. The financial performance demonstrates the contrary: RegimA SA operates 25 Shopify stores with R8.5 million turnover, while RegimA Zone operates 26 Shopify stores with R26.4 million turnover. My late partner, Kayla Pretorius, and I built these operations from inception. Kayla was murdered on 13 July 2023. After her death, I continued managing the operations profitably until they were systematically sabotaged.\n#### AD 2.4 - Parties to the Application - Introduction\n3.4 The Applicant introduces the parties. The corporate structure reveals that certain entities are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. The trust has three trustees, but the identity of the third trustee was unknown to me as a beneficiary until recently.\n#### AD 3 - Court Order for Probation of Directors/Members\n3.5 The Applicant seeks probation orders under Section 162 of the Companies Act. On 10 June 2025, four days after I provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies, I requested an independent audit. Mr. Bantjies dismissed my request, stating he was \"going on holiday.\" The Applicant cancelled 15 UK business cards on 7 June 2025, one day after I cooperated with his request.\n#### AD 3.2 - Respondents - Wife\n3.6 The First Respondent is correctly identified as the Applicant's wife and my mother. On 15 May 2025, she confronted Rynette Farrar regarding a debt of R1,035,000 owed by RegimA Skin Treatments CC to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd since February 2023. These funds were part of Kayla's estate.\n#### AD 3.4 - Respondents - Son\n3.7 I am correctly identified as the Applicant's son and Second Respondent. On 30 March 2025, Ms. Farrar and the Applicant dumped two years of unallocated expenses from all companies into RegimA Worldwide Distribution and demanded I sign off within 12 hours for SARS VAT and Annual Accounts (Annexure **DF14**). I used the deadline extension (until 6 June) to finalize reports and uncover fraud. On 6 June 2025, I provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies regarding Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC, which demonstrated an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group (Annexure **DF2**, **DF3**).\n#### AD 3.4.2 - Third Respondent - RegimA Skin Treatments\n3.8 RegimA Skin Treatments CC (B1992/005371/23) owes R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, part of Kayla's estate, since February 2023 (Annexure **SF6**). This debt was the subject of the First Respondent's inquiry on 15 May 2025. RegimA Skin Treatments receives stock from Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure **SF5**).\n#### AD 3.6 - Fourth Respondent - Regim A UK\n3.9 RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. Kayla and I established this UK company to own and operate the global e-commerce operations. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments totaling R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**, **DF8**). The UK company funded SA operations, not the reverse.\n#### AD 3.6.1 - Fifth Respondent - Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC\n3.10 Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC (1996/004451/23) is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. My analysis revealed an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group\u2014an excessive profit extraction mechanism (Annexure **DF2**). This was the fraud I reported to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025. Mr. Bantjies was \"running the companies\" at the time. On 10 June 2025, Mr. Bantjies dismissed my audit request.\n#### AD 3.6.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Villa Via Arcadia\n3.11 Property registration confirms trust ownership. The trust has three trustees. The third trustee's identity was not disclosed to me as a beneficiary until recently.\n#### AD 3.7 - Sixth Respondent - Strategic Logistics CC\n3.12 Strategic Logistics CC (2008/136496/23) experienced a R5.4 million stock adjustment in 2024 (Annexure **SF3**). This represents 46% of annual sales (R5.4M on R11.3M sales) and is 10 times the prior year's adjustment. The stock type matches inventory supplied by Adderory (Pty) Ltd to RegimA Skin Treatments (Annexure **SF5**). In a SARS audit email, Ms. Farrar claimed that Mr. Bantjies instructed her to make the substantial payments related to this transaction (Annexure **SF4**).\n#### AD 3.7.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Strategic Logistics\n3.13 Property registration documents are noted. The R5.4M stock that allegedly \"just disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics is the same type of stock supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments.\n#### AD 3.8 - Seventh Respondent - FirstRand Bank (FNB)\n3.14 FNB holds accounts for the companies. On 14 and 15 February 2025, unauthorized transfers of R450,000 each (R900,000 total) were made from RegimA SA's FNB account without my authority as co-director (Annexure **DF9**). The account opened with R997,597.94 and closed at R5,284.08 within one month (Feb-Mar 2025), despite 169 customer deposits totaling R566,598.57 proving active trade (Annexures **DF10**, **DF11**).\n#### AD 3.9 - Eighth and Ninth Respondents\n3.15 ABSA Bank and CIPC are cited. Revenue diversion for RegimA SA began on 1 March 2025. Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution began with an ABSA bank letter dated 14 April 2025 (Annexure **DF12**).\n#### AD 3.11 - Reference to Respondents as Wife and Son\n3.16 The Applicant refers to the First Respondent and me as \"my wife\" and \"my son.\" We are both beneficiaries of the Faucitt Family Trust. The First Respondent is also a co-trustee. As beneficiaries, we have a legitimate interest in ensuring the trust is managed in accordance with the Trust Property Control Act, 57 of 1988, which requires trustees to act with care, diligence, and skill in the interests of beneficiaries.\n#### AD 3.13 - Court Jurisdiction and Identity Confirmation\n3.17 Jurisdiction is confirmed. The affidavit was commissioned by Mr. Bantjies, who signed as \"Commissioner of Oaths.\" Mr. Bantjies's accounting firm is \"Bantjes and Company.\" Mr. Bantjies is also the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust\u2014a status that was unknown to me as a beneficiary. Mr. Bantjies is also a debtor to the trust, owing R18.685 million on an investment payout schedule (Annexure **SF1**).\n---\n### 4. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTANT DETAILS - BANTJIES CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n#### AD 4 - Accountant Details - Bantjes and Company\n4.1 The Applicant identifies \"our accountant\" as Mr. Bantjies, who attended the office in mid-June 2025. The Applicant omits the following material facts:\n4.1.1 Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust\u2014a status unknown to me as a beneficiary until recently.\n4.1.2 Mr. Bantjies is a debtor to the trust, owing R18.685 million on an investment payout schedule with payments due in May 2026, May 2027, and May 2029 (Annexure **SF1**).\n4.1.3 Mr. Bantjies was \"running the companies\" when I reported Villa Via fraud to him on 6 June 2025.\n4.1.4 Mr. Bantjies dismissed my audit request on 10 June 2025, stating he was \"going on holiday.\"\n4.1.5 Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed her to make multi-million rand payments, including the R5.4M stock adjustment payments (SARS audit email, Annexure **SF4**).\n4.2 This creates an impermissible conflict of interest: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant + Company Controller + Commissioner of Oaths for this affidavit. Mr. Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery of the fraud I reported.\n---\n### 5. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1-6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE\n#### AD 6.1 - Relationships Between Parties\n5.1 The Applicant describes family and corporate relationships. The actual control structure reveals: Ms. Farrar controlled all bank accounts, the Sage accounting system (using the Applicant's email pete@regima.com), and claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions rather than the Applicant's (Annexures **SF2**, **SF4**). The Applicant had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems.\n#### AD 6.3 - Directors and Members of Respondent Entities\n5.2 The Applicant describes directorships. The First Respondent and I are co-directors of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd. On 14 and 15 February 2025, R900,000 was transferred from RegimA SA without my authority as co-director (Annexure **DF9**). On 30 March 2025, two years of unallocated expenses were dumped into RegimA Worldwide Distribution with a 12-hour deadline for sign-off (Annexure **DF14**).\n#### AD 6.5 - Banking and Registration of Respondent Entities\n5.3 The Applicant describes banking arrangements. The systematic revenue diversion included: (1) RegimA SA: diversion started 1 March 2025; (2) RegimA Worldwide Distribution: ABSA bank letter 14 April 2025; (3) Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025 (100% audit data loss); (4) Card cancellation 7 June 2025 (rendering documentation inaccessible); (5) Account emptying 11 September 2025 (R1.73M transferred) (Annexure **DF12**).\n---\n### 6. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7-7.20: URGENCY AND ALLEGED MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 7 - Urgency and Delay Considerations\n6.1 The Applicant claims urgency. The timeline reveals: (1) Alleged discovery mid-June 2025; (2) Application filed August 2025; (3) Two-month delay contradicts urgency. The actual urgency relates to my fraud exposure on 6 June 2025 and the First Respondent's debt inquiry on 15 May 2025.\n#### AD 7.3 - Urgency Details\n6.2 The Applicant claims the accountant noted \"numerous discrepancies\" in mid-June 2025. Timeline analysis reveals: (1) 6 June 2025: I provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies; (2) 7 June 2025: Applicant cancelled 15 UK business cards without notice (Annexure **DF4**); (3) 10 June 2025: Mr. Bantjies dismissed my audit request. The card cancellation occurred one day after my cooperation, not \"following\" any discovery. This demonstrates that the Applicant created the problem he now complains about (*venire contra factum proprium*).\n#### AD 7.6 - Financial Impact of Misconduct\n6.3 The Applicant alleges financial impact. The actual financial sabotage included: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) Revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025; (3) Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025 (seven days after First Respondent's confrontation); (4) Domain theft 29 May 2025 (regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory, 14 days after First Respondent's confrontation, Annexure **JF4**); (5) Card cancellation 7 June 2025 (one day after my cooperation); (6) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 (Annexure **DF13**).\n#### AD 7.8 - Continuing Harm to Corporations\n6.4 The Applicant claims continuing harm. The harm was systematically inflicted over six months (Feb-Sep 2025): (1) Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (4) May: Data expunged, domain stolen; (5) Jun: Cards cancelled, audit dismissed; (6) Jul: Warehouse sabotaged; (7) Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action occurred after either the First Respondent's debt inquiry (15 May) or my fraud exposure (6 June).\n#### AD 7.10 - Card Cancellations and Service Interruptions\n6.5 The Applicant claims he cancelled cards in June 2025 \"following\" the accountant's discovery. Timeline evidence demonstrates: (1) 6 June: I provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies; (2) 7 June: Applicant cancelled UK cards (5191, 5225) paying for Shopify subscriptions (Annexure **DF4**); (3) Cards cancelled one day after my cooperation, not after any discovery. The cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible through card-based authentication, then the Applicant complained about missing documentation.\n#### AD 7.13 - Domain and Service Halts Due to Card Cancellations\n6.6 The Applicant claims subscriptions were halted due to card cancellations. To prevent business collapse, I substituted my personal card (1927) for RegimA SA and the First Respondent substituted her personal card (3212) for RegimA Zone (Annexure **JF7**). Meanwhile, the competing domain regimaskin.co.za (owned by Adderory, Ms. Farrar's son's company) was actively diverting customers (Annexure **JF4**).\n#### AD 7.16 - Son's Interference with Business Operations\n6.7 The Applicant alleges I interfered with operations. The evidence demonstrates I built and managed 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually (Annexure **DF1**). Kayla and I co-built these operations from inception. After Kayla's murder on 13 July 2023, a court order was obtained to seize her email account (kayp@rzo.io), which interfered with a law enforcement investigation that had instructed a freeze on the account (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.18 - Email and Account Access Interference\n6.8 The Applicant claims I restricted email access. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to his own email (pete@regima.com)\u2014controlled by Ms. Farrar; (2) Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 show Ms. Farrar using the Applicant's email (Annexure **SF2**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's (Annexure **SF4**); (4) Kayla's email was seized by court order after her murder, interfering with law enforcement investigation (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.20 - Continued Interference Not in Corporate Interests\n6.9 The Applicant claims interference is not in corporate interests. The corporate interests were served by my profitable operations (R34.9M annually). The interference came from: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Domain theft; (6) Warehouse sabotage; (7) Account emptying. Despite six months of systematic sabotage, I was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied on 11 September 2025.\n---\n### 7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 8.4-9.3: FINANCIAL DISCREPANCIES AND MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 8.4 - Discovery of Financial Discrepancies\n7.1 The Applicant claims the accountant discovered discrepancies. Mr. Bantjies is: (1) Undisclosed trustee; (2) Debtor owing R18.685M; (3) Controller of financial systems; (4) Recipient of my fraud report on 6 June 2025. Mr. Bantjies dismissed my audit request on 10 June 2025. The \"discovery\" occurred after I exposed fraud to the person facilitating it.\n#### AD 8.5 - Accountant's Attendance and Findings\n7.2 The Applicant states Mr. Bantjies attended for provisional tax and VAT submissions. The two years of unallocated expenses (dumped into RegimA Worldwide Distribution on 30 March 2025) occurred while: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled the accounting system using the Applicant's email; (2) Linda (Ms. Farrar's sister) was employed as bookkeeper (Annexure **SF8**); (3) Mr. Bantjies was the accountant and trustee. The question arises: why were expenses unallocated for two years if the accountant, trustee, and bookkeeper were performing their duties?\n#### AD 8.7 - IT Expenses and Tax Problems\n7.3 The Applicant cites IT expenses: 2024 tax year R6,738,007.47; 2025 tax year R2,116,159.47. The Applicant claims these are \"almost entirely unexplainable.\" The context omitted from the founding affidavit is that these expenses supported 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually (Annexure **DF1**). The IT expenses represent 19.3% of revenue (2024) and 6.1% of revenue (2025)\u2014reasonable for a global e-commerce operation with 51+ stores across multiple jurisdictions. The Applicant fails to disclose the revenue context, creating a false impression of unexplained expenses.\n#### AD 8.10 - International Expenses and Tax Implications\n7.4 The Applicant claims expenses are \"seemingly international\" and accounts have \"almost exceeded the yearly allowable quota for funds leaving South Africa.\" The Shopify platforms were funded by UK company RegimA Zone Ltd (company 10697009). UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). Shopify invoices demonstrate UK \u2192 SA payment flow of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The international expenses were legitimate costs of UK-owned e-commerce operations, and the payment direction was UK \u2192 SA, not SA \u2192 UK.\n#### AD 9.2 - Bank Message Regarding International Transfers\n7.5 The Applicant references bank messages about international transfers. The actual international payment flow is demonstrated by Shopify invoices: UK entities (RegimA Zone Ltd) funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). UK bank transactions corroborate the invoices (Annexure **DF8**). The payment direction is UK \u2192 SA, not SA \u2192 UK as the Applicant's affidavit implies. The Applicant's statement is demonstrably false.\n#### AD 9.3 - Financial Misconduct Summary\n7.6 The Applicant summarizes alleged misconduct. The documented financial misconduct includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) without my authority as co-director; (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments (Annexures **SF3**, **SF5**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments for this stock (SARS audit email, Annexure **SF4**); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023, unpaid despite Ms. Farrar's false claim to the First Respondent that it was paid (Annexures **JF2**, **SF6**).\n---\n### 8. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1-10.14: APPLICATION TO DECLARE RESPONDENTS DELINQUENT\n#### AD 10.1 - Relief Sought - Delinquency or Probation\n8.1 The Applicant seeks delinquency or probation orders under Section 162. The evidence establishes grounds for the Applicant's own delinquency: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers in breach of fiduciary duty as co-director; (2) Card cancellation sabotage one day after my cooperation; (3) False statements about UK payment flows (perjury); (4) Abuse of ex parte process through material non-disclosures; (5) Systematic sabotage of profitable businesses (R34.9M operations destroyed).\n#### AD 10.3 - Delinquent Conduct of Respondents\n8.2 The Applicant alleges delinquent conduct by the First Respondent and me. My actual conduct included: (1) Building and managing R34.9M profitable operations with Kayla; (2) Cooperating with the Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025; (3) Exposing Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (4) Requesting independent audit on 10 June 2025; (5) Substituting personal card to prevent business collapse after Applicant's card cancellation; (6) Continuing to pay creditors despite six months of systematic sabotage.\n#### AD 10.4 - Contravention of Companies Act\n8.3 The Applicant alleges Companies Act contraventions. Section 76(3)(b) requires directors to act in good faith and for a proper purpose. The Applicant's actions demonstrate bad faith: (1) Manufactured crisis (card cancellation day after my cooperation); (2) Material non-disclosures in ex parte application (Mr. Bantjies's trustee status, debtor status, timeline, UK payment flow); (3) False statements about UK operations (perjury); (4) Systematic sabotage of profitable businesses I built.\n#### AD 10.5.2 - Probation Relief Under Section 162\n8.4 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence reveals: Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant + Company Controller) commissioned this affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths. Mr. Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery of the fraud I reported on 6 June 2025.\n#### AD 10.6 - Close Corporations Act - Fiduciary Duties\n8.5 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act fiduciary duties. The Act requires members to manage in the corporation's interest. RegimA Skin Treatments (CC) owes R1,035,000 to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023. Strategic Logistics (CC) lost R5.4M in stock that \"disappeared\"\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory. Villa Via (CC) charged 86% profit margin rent to the group. These transactions were not in the corporations' interests.\n#### AD 10.6.1 - Member's Duty to Manage in Corporation's Interest\n8.6 The Applicant cites duty to manage in corporation's interest. The R5.4M stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics represents 46% of annual sales\u201410 times the historical adjustment (Annexure **SF3**). Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments (Annexure **SF4**). This transaction was not in Strategic Logistics' interest. The transaction appears to be transfer pricing manipulation: stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics and appeared in RegimA Skin Treatments, supplied by Adderory (Ms. Farrar's son's company).\n#### AD 10.6.2 - Member's Duty Not to Exceed Powers\n8.7 The Applicant cites duty not to exceed powers. The unauthorized R900,000 transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) were made without my authority as co-director (Annexure **DF9**). The Applicant exceeded his powers by acting unilaterally. RegimA SA account: opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 within one month, despite 169 customer deposits R566,598.57 proving active trade (Annexures **DF10**, **DF11**).\n#### AD 10.6.3 - Member's Duty to Avoid Conflicts of Interest\n8.8 The Applicant cites duty to avoid conflicts. The evidence reveals multiple conflicts: (1) Mr. Bantjies: Trustee + Debtor (R18.685M) + Accountant + Company Controller + Commissioner of Oaths; (2) Ms. Farrar's son (Adderory) supplying stock to RegimA Skin Treatments while same stock type \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) Villa Via (trust-owned) charging 86% profit margin rent to group; (4) Regimaskin.co.za (owned by Ms. Farrar's son) competing with operations I built; (5) Ms. Farrar controlling systems while claiming to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions.\n#### AD 10.7 - Member Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n8.9 The Applicant invokes breach of fiduciary duty liability. The breaches are established: (1) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to me (co-director) by unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to me (beneficiary) by attacking me with interdict after I exposed fraud; (3) Mr. Bantjies breached fiduciary duty to me (beneficiary) by dismissing my audit request and facilitating fraud; (4) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to corporations by systematic sabotage of profitable operations.\n#### AD 10.7.1.2 - Liability for Economic Benefit Derived\n8.10 The Applicant cites liability for economic benefit. The economic benefits derived include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics (transfer pricing to Adderory \u2192 RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (4) 86% profit margin on Villa Via rent (R34.9M operations forced to pay excessive rent); (5) Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za (Adderory).\n#### AD 10.7.1.4 - Liability for Loss Suffered by Corporation\n8.11 The Applicant cites liability for corporate loss. The losses suffered include: (1) RegimA SA: R900K unauthorized transfers, revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025, account depleted from R997,597.94 to R5,284.08; (2) RegimA Zone: Customer diversion to competing domain, card cancellation sabotage, R26.4M operations destroyed; (3) Strategic Logistics: R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (4) RegimA Worldwide: Forced to pay 2 years of unallocated expenses from all companies, R8.5M operations destroyed; (5) All companies: Shopify data expunged (100% audit data loss), warehouse sabotaged, accounts emptied R1.73M (11 Sep 2025).\n#### AD 10.8 - Disqualification for Misconduct Under Section 47\n8.12 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act Section 47 disqualification. This section applies when a member is guilty of gross negligence or fraud. The R5.4M stock adjustment (46% of sales, 10x historical) in Strategic Logistics, with Ms. Farrar claiming Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments, and the same stock type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments, suggests systematic fraud through transfer pricing manipulation.\n#### AD 10.8.1 - Declaration of Delinquency as Alternative Relief\n8.13 The Applicant seeks delinquency declaration. The evidence supports declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5): (1) Intentional harm to companies (systematic sabotage destroying R34.9M operations); (2) Grossly negligent conduct (card cancellation without notice rendering documentation inaccessible); (3) Breach of trust (trustee attacking beneficiaries); (4) Abuse of process (ex parte order based on material non-disclosures and false statements); (5) Perjury (false statements about UK payment flows).\n#### AD 10.9 - Mandatory Disqualification Under Section 162(5)\n8.14 The Applicant invokes Section 162(5) mandatory disqualification grounds. These grounds apply to the Applicant's conduct: (1) Intentional harm to companies (R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage, revenue diversions, data expungement, card cancellation, account emptying); (2) Grossly negligent harm (card cancellation rendering documentation inaccessible, then complaining about missing documentation); (3) Breach of trust (trustee attacking beneficiaries who exposed fraud).\n#### AD 10.9.2 - Intentional or Grossly Negligent Harm\n8.15 The Applicant alleges intentional or grossly negligent harm by respondents. The intentional harm was inflicted by the Applicant and his co-conspirators over six months: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping (12-hour deadline); (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 15 May: First Respondent's debt inquiry; (6) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days later); (7) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days later); (8) 6 Jun: My fraud exposure; (9) 7 Jun: Cards cancelled (1 day later); (10) 10 Jun: Audit dismissed; (11) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotaged; (12) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied.\n#### AD 10.9.3 - Manner of Acting - Gross Negligence or Misconduct\n8.16 The Applicant alleges gross negligence or misconduct. The gross negligence is demonstrated by: Cancelling 15 business cards without notice, rendering documentation inaccessible through card-based authentication, then complaining about missing documentation. This demonstrates consciousness of guilt and bad faith. The Applicant created the problem he now complains about (*venire contra factum proprium*).\n#### AD 10.9.3.1 - Gross Negligence or Wilful Misconduct\n8.17 The Applicant alleges wilful misconduct. The wilful misconduct includes: (1) Systematic revenue diversion (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (2) Data destruction (22 May, 100% audit data loss); (3) Domain theft (29 May, diverting customers to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son); (4) Card sabotage (7 Jun, day after my cooperation); (5) Audit dismissal (10 Jun, by Mr. Bantjies); (6) Warehouse sabotage (8 Jul, destroying R34.9M operations); (7) Account emptying (11 Sep, R1.73M transferred). This six-month campaign occurred after the First Respondent investigated fraud (15 May) and I exposed fraud (6 Jun).\n#### AD 10.9.3.2 - Acquiescence to Fraudulent Acts\n8.18 The Applicant alleges acquiescence to fraud. The acquiescence to fraud includes: (1) Two years of unallocated expenses while Ms. Farrar controlled systems using the Applicant's email, Linda was employed as bookkeeper, and Mr. Bantjies was accountant and trustee; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics with Mr. Bantjies allegedly instructing payments, same stock type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments; (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate unpaid since Feb 2023, Ms. Farrar falsely claimed paid; (4) Villa Via 86% profit margin rent extraction from operations I built.\n#### AD 10.9.3.3 - Party to Omission with Fraudulent Purpose\n8.19 The Applicant alleges omission with fraudulent purpose. The omissions with fraudulent purpose include: (1) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's trustee status from affidavit; (2) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt to trust; (3) Applicant omitted R34.9M revenue context for IT expenses; (4) Applicant omitted UK \u2192 SA payment flow (claimed opposite, perjury); (5) Applicant omitted timeline showing card cancellation day after my cooperation; (6) Applicant omitted First Respondent's debt inquiry and subsequent retaliation; (7) Applicant omitted my fraud exposure and subsequent sabotage campaign.\n#### AD 10.10 - Probation Under Section 162(7)\n8.20 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162(7). This section applies when conduct is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) I built R34.9M profitable operations with Kayla, then was systematically sabotaged after exposing fraud; (2) I cooperated with Applicant's request on 6 June, then suffered card cancellation on 7 June; (3) I requested audit on 10 June, then Mr. Bantjies dismissed it; (4) I substituted personal card to prevent business collapse, then was attacked with interdict; (5) I was excluded from profitable businesses I built with murdered partner.\n#### AD 10.10.2.3 - Oppressive or Prejudicial Exercise of Powers\n8.21 The Applicant alleges oppressive exercise of powers. The oppressive exercise of powers includes: (1) Applicant used trustee powers to attack beneficiaries who exposed fraud; (2) Mr. Bantjies used trustee powers to dismiss audit request and facilitate fraud; (3) Applicant used director powers to make unauthorized R900K transfers without my authority as co-director; (4) Applicant used court process to obtain ex parte order based on material non-disclosures and false statements (perjury).\n#### AD 10.10.2.4 - Conduct with Oppressive or Prejudicial Result\n8.22 The Applicant alleges conduct with prejudicial result. The prejudicial results include: (1) I was excluded from R34.9M operations I built with murdered partner Kayla; (2) Customers diverted to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Adderory); (3) R900K transferred without my authorization as co-director; (4) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics (transfer pricing to Adderory); (5) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate unpaid; (6) Audit data expunged (100% loss); (7) Documentation rendered inaccessible; (8) Warehouse sabotaged; (9) Accounts emptied.\n#### AD 10.10.22 - Business Conducted in Oppressive Manner\n8.23 The Applicant alleges oppressive business conduct. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled all systems using Applicant's email while claiming to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions; (2) Applicant had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems; (3) Two years of expenses unallocated despite employed bookkeeper (Linda, Ms. Farrar's sister) and accountant/trustee (Mr. Bantjies); (4) Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor R18.685M + Accountant) dismissed my fraud investigation and audit request.\n#### AD 10.10.41 - Conduct Inconsistent with Duties\n8.24 The Applicant alleges conduct inconsistent with duties. The conduct inconsistent with duties includes: (1) Trustee attacking beneficiaries who exposed fraud (Applicant, Mr. Bantjies); (2) Director making unauthorized transfers without co-director's authority (Applicant); (3) Trustee dismissing beneficiary's fraud investigation and audit request (Mr. Bantjies); (4) Accountant/Trustee facilitating fraud while being debtor R18.685M (Mr. Bantjies); (5) Administrator controlling systems while diverting revenue and facilitating son's competing domain (Ms. Farrar).\n#### AD 10.13 - Unaccounted Money - Significant Sums\n8.25 The Applicant alleges unaccounted money. The unaccounted money includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025) without my authority; (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics (same type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023; (4) R1.73 million transferred 11 Sep 2025; (5) Two years of unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide on 30 Mar 2025.\n#### AD 10.14 - Full Extent of Transgressions Not Yet Determined\n8.26 The Applicant claims full extent not yet determined. The full extent includes: (1) Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt to trust; (3) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email (pete@regima.com); (4) Ms. Farrar's son's competing domain (regimaskin.co.za); (5) Adderory's stock supply relationship and transfer pricing scheme; (6) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (7) Court order seizing Kayla's email during law enforcement investigation; (8) Six-month systematic sabotage campaign (Feb-Sep 2025).\n---\n### 9. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 11.2-12.4: UK OPERATIONS AND ALLEGED FRAUD\n#### AD 11.2 - UK Head Office - RegimA UK Ltd\n9.1 The Applicant describes UK operations. RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. Kayla and I established this UK company to own and operate the global e-commerce operations. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The UK company is the economic owner of the e-commerce operations generating R34.9M annually.\n#### AD 11.3 - Directors of UK Entity\n9.2 The Applicant describes UK directors. Kayla and I established the UK company to own and operate the global e-commerce platforms. After Kayla's murder on 13 July 2023, I continued managing the operations profitably until they were systematically sabotaged (Feb-Sep 2025).\n#### AD 11.4 - Applicant's Role in Operations\n9.3 The Applicant describes his role. The evidence demonstrates the Applicant had no operational role: (1) No access to email (pete@regima.com controlled by Ms. Farrar, Annexure **SF2**); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar using Applicant's email); (4) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's (Annexure **SF4**). The Applicant appears to be a figurehead while Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) had ultimate control.\n#### AD 11.6 - UK Branch Operations\n9.4 The Applicant describes UK branch operations. The UK company funded SA operations through Shopify subscription payments. Shopify invoices demonstrate UK \u2192 SA payment flow of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). UK bank transactions corroborate the invoices (Annexure **DF8**). The UK company invested in SA operations, not the reverse. The Applicant's claim that UK owes SA is demonstrably false (perjury).\n#### AD 11.8 - UK Financial Concerns\n9.5 The Applicant expresses UK financial concerns. The financial concerns were manufactured through systematic sabotage: (1) Card cancellation 7 June 2025 disrupted UK funding (Annexure **DF4**); (2) Domain theft 29 May 2025 diverted customers to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure **JF4**); (3) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 destroyed UK-funded operations (Annexure **DF13**); (4) Data expungement 22 May 2025 eliminated audit trail (100% loss).\n#### AD 12.1 - UK Branch Non-Payment and Fraud Concerns\n9.6 The Applicant alleges UK branch non-payment and fraud. The Shopify invoices prove the opposite: UK entities funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). UK bank transactions corroborate the invoices (Annexure **DF8**). The payment direction is UK \u2192 SA, not SA \u2192 UK. The Applicant's statement is demonstrably false (perjury). This material misrepresentation was included in the ex parte application to mislead the Court.\n#### AD 12.2 - Misappropriation Leading to Insolvency Risk\n9.7 The Applicant alleges misappropriation leading to insolvency. The actual insolvency risk was created by the Applicant's six-month sabotage campaign: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb); (2) Revenue diversions (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (3) Data expungement (22 May); (4) Domain theft (29 May); (5) Card cancellation (7 Jun); (6) Warehouse sabotage (8 Jul); (7) Account emptying (11 Sep, R1.73M). Despite six months of systematic sabotage, I was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied on 11 September 2025.\n#### AD 12.3 - Purpose of Court Application\n9.8 The Applicant states the purpose is to prevent further harm. The actual purpose appears to be: (1) Punish First Respondent for investigating R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate (15 May); (2) Punish me for exposing Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (6 June); (3) Seize control of R34.9M operations I built with murdered partner Kayla; (4) Prevent forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor R18.685M + Accountant) and the systematic fraud (R5.4M stock transfer pricing, R1,035,000 debt, two years unallocated expenses).\n#### AD 12.4 - Alternative Roles for Wife and Son\n9.9 The Applicant suggests alternative roles for the First Respondent and me. The evidence demonstrates: (1) First Respondent fulfilled trustee duties by investigating fraud (R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate); (2) I built and managed R34.9M profitable operations with murdered partner Kayla; (3) I cooperated with Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025; (4) I exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (5) Both of us were systematically sabotaged after investigating/exposing fraud; (6) Both of us were attacked with interdict by co-trustees.\n---\n### 10. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 13.2-13.8: REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERDICTORY RELIEF\n#### AD 13.2 - Clear Right Not to Be Prejudiced\n10.1 The Applicant claims clear right not to be prejudiced. The Applicant has no clear right: (1) He manufactured the crisis (card cancellation day after my cooperation, *venire contra factum proprium*); (2) He made unauthorized R900K transfers without my authority as co-director; (3) He had alternative remedies as trustee with \"additional powers\" as Founder; (4) He obtained order through material non-disclosures (Mr. Bantjies's trustee status, debtor status, timeline manipulation, UK payment flow misrepresentation/perjury, revenue context omission).\n#### AD 13.2.2 - Injury Sustained and Apprehension of Further Harm\n10.2 The Applicant claims injury and apprehension of harm. The Applicant suffered no injury he didn't inflict on himself: (1) Card cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible; (2) Unauthorized transfers depleted accounts; (3) Revenue diversions reduced cash flow; (4) Warehouse sabotage destroyed operations; (5) Data expungement eliminated audit trail. The apprehension of further harm was manufactured to justify ex parte relief. The actual harm was suffered by me: R34.9M operations I built with murdered partner Kayla were systematically destroyed.\n#### AD 13.3 - Reasonable Apprehension of Irreparable Harm\n10.3 The Applicant claims reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm. The irreparable harm was inflicted by the Applicant's six-month sabotage campaign: (1) R34.9M operations destroyed (93.3% revenue collapse from R34.9M to R2.3M); (2) Customer relationships diverted to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son; (3) Audit data expunged (100% loss); (4) Documentation rendered inaccessible through card-based authentication; (5) Accounts emptied (R1.73M transferred 11 Sep). The First Respondent and I suffered irreparable harm, not the Applicant.\n#### AD 13.4 - Interdicts Essential for Corporation Survival\n10.4 The Applicant claims interdicts essential for survival. The corporations were highly profitable under my management (R34.9M annually). The survival threat came from the Applicant's sabotage: (1) Unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data destruction; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Domain theft; (6) Warehouse sabotage; (7) Account emptying. Excluding the First Respondent and me threatened survival, not ensured it. I was still managing to pay creditors despite six months of sabotage until the accounts were emptied.\n#### AD 13.5 - Balance of Convenience Favours Granting Relief\n10.5 The Applicant claims balance of convenience favors relief. The balance overwhelmingly favors the First Respondent and me: (1) I built and managed R34.9M profitable operations with murdered partner Kayla; (2) I cooperated with Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports; (3) I exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies; (4) I requested independent audit; (5) I substituted personal card to prevent business collapse; (6) I continued paying creditors despite six months of sabotage; (7) I support independent forensic audit. The Applicant obtained relief through material non-disclosures and false statements (perjury).\n#### AD 13.8 - Other Relief Sought in Part A\n10.6 The Applicant seeks additional relief. The relief was obtained ex parte based on material non-disclosures and false statements: (1) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Omitting timeline showing card cancellation day after my cooperation; (4) Falsely claiming UK owes SA (opposite is true, perjury); (5) Omitting R34.9M revenue context for IT expenses; (6) Omitting First Respondent's debt inquiry and retaliation pattern; (7) Omitting my fraud exposure and sabotage campaign.\n---\n### 11. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1-14.5: FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND FORENSIC AUDIT\n#### AD 14.1 - Financial Constraints on Respondents\n11.1 The Applicant seeks financial constraints on the First Respondent and me. The financial constraints were already imposed through six months of systematic sabotage: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (3) Data expungement (22 May); (4) Domain theft (29 May); (5) Card cancellations (7 Jun); (6) Warehouse sabotage (8 Jul); (7) Account emptying (11 Sep, R1.73M). Despite this sabotage, I was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied.\n#### AD 14.3 - Constraint to Prevent Financial Prejudice\n11.2 The Applicant seeks constraints to prevent prejudice. The prejudice was inflicted by the Applicant: (1) RegimA SA account opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 within one month (Feb-Mar 2025); (2) 169 customer deposits R566,598.57 proving active trade; (3) R1.73M transferred 11 Sep 2025; (4) R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage (93.3% revenue collapse).\n#### AD 14.4 - Forensic Audit Necessity and Remuneration\n11.3 The Applicant seeks forensic audit. I support independent forensic audit by an impartial party (not Mr. Bantjies or anyone connected to him). Such audit would reveal: (1) Mr. Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor R18.685M + Accountant + Company Controller); (2) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme (Strategic Logistics \u2192 Adderory \u2192 RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate unpaid since Feb 2023; (4) Two years unallocated expenses while Ms. Farrar controlled systems, Linda was employed as bookkeeper, and Mr. Bantjies was accountant/trustee; (5) Unauthorized R900K transfers without my authority; (6) Revenue diversion scheme (1 Mar, 14 Apr, 11 Sep); (7) Ms. Farrar's control of systems using Applicant's email and Adderory's role.\n#### AD 14.5 - Request for Relief Under Part B\n11.4 The Applicant requests Part B relief. The relief should include: (1) Setting aside ex parte order obtained through material non-disclosures and false statements (perjury); (2) Independent forensic audit by impartial auditor (not Mr. Bantjies); (3) Investigation of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor R18.685M + Accountant); (4) Investigation of R5.4M stock \"disappearance\" and transfer pricing scheme; (5) Recovery of R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (6) Investigation of Ms. Farrar's control and Adderory's role; (7) Consideration of Applicant's delinquency under Section 162(5) for systematic sabotage, perjury, and abuse of process.\n---\n### 12. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1-16.12: DISCOVERY AND URGENCY\n#### AD 16.1 - Discovery of Respondents' Conduct\n12.1 The Applicant claims discovery of conduct in mid-June 2025. The actual discovery timeline: (1) 15 May: First Respondent discovered R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate, confronted Ms. Farrar; (2) 6 June: I exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies; (3) 7 June: Applicant cancelled cards (day after my cooperation); (4) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed my audit request. The Applicant's \"discovery\" was actually consciousness of guilt after I exposed fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator).\n#### AD 16.2 - R600,000 Transfer as Trigger for Action\n12.2 The Applicant cites R600,000 transfer (later corrected to R500,000) as trigger. The actual triggers were: (1) 15 May: First Respondent confronted Ms. Farrar about R1,035,000 debt and \"profiting from proceeds of murder\"; (2) 6 June: I exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator who owed R18.685M to trust); (3) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed my audit request. The R500,000 transfer is a pretext. The real trigger was my fraud exposure threatening Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt concealment.\n#### AD 16.5 - Unawareness of Urgent Application Process\n12.3 The Applicant claims unawareness of urgent process. The Applicant had access to legal advice and Mr. Bantjies as Commissioner of Oaths. The delay from mid-June to August (two months) contradicts urgency. The actual urgency appears to be preventing forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor R18.685M + Accountant) and systematic fraud (R5.4M stock transfer pricing, R1,035,000 debt, two years unallocated expenses).\n#### AD 16.6 - Delay Would Have Been Avoided\n12.4 The Applicant claims delay would have been avoided if he knew the process. The two-month delay (mid-June to August) contradicts urgency. The timing suggests: (1) Waiting to see if my audit request would proceed; (2) Coordinating with Mr. Bantjies (who dismissed audit request 10 June); (3) Preparing First Respondent's punishment (included in interdict 13 Aug, two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document 11 Aug); (4) Executing final sabotage (warehouse 8 Jul, accounts 11 Sep).\n#### AD 16.8 - State of Shock and Delayed Response\n12.5 The Applicant claims state of shock. The Applicant was not in shock\u2014he was executing a systematic six-month sabotage campaign: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping (12-hour deadline); (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days after First Respondent's inquiry); (6) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days after First Respondent's inquiry); (7) 7 Jun: Cards cancelled (1 day after my cooperation); (8) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotaged; (9) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. This is not shock\u2014this is systematic execution coordinated with Mr. Bantjies.\n#### AD 16.10 - Attorney Consultation Timeline\n12.6 The Applicant describes attorney consultation. The consultation occurred after: (1) First Respondent's debt inquiry (15 May); (2) Data expungement (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) My fraud exposure (6 June); (5) Card cancellation (7 June); (6) Mr. Bantjies's audit dismissal (10 June). The legal action was retaliation, not discovery. The Applicant and Mr. Bantjies coordinated to attack beneficiaries who exposed fraud.\n#### AD 16.12 - Need for Urgent Court Assistance\n12.7 The Applicant claims need for urgent assistance. The Applicant had alternative remedies: (1) Trustee with \"additional powers\" as Founder; (2) Could have conducted audit as trustee; (3) Could have consulted with co-trustee (First Respondent) instead of attacking her; (4) Could have consulted with co-trustee Mr. Bantjies (who was facilitating the fraud and owed R18.685M). The Applicant chose ex parte process to avoid disclosure of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts, systematic sabotage, and false statements about UK operations.\n---\n### 13. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 17.3-17.4: EX PARTE BASIS\n#### AD 17.3 - Ex Parte Basis for Application\n13.1 The Applicant justifies ex parte application. The ex parte process was abused through material non-disclosures and false statements: (1) Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt to trust; (3) Timeline manipulation (card cancellation day after my cooperation, not \"following\" discovery); (4) UK payment flow misrepresentation (claimed SA \u2192 UK, actually UK \u2192 SA, perjury); (5) R34.9M revenue context omission for IT expenses; (6) First Respondent's debt inquiry and retaliation pattern (data expunged 7 days, domain stolen 14 days); (7) My fraud exposure and sabotage campaign (card cancelled 1 day, audit dismissed 4 days); (8) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email (pete@regima.com); (9) Adderory's competing domain (regimaskin.co.za); (10) R5.4M stock \"disappearance\" and transfer pricing scheme.\n#### AD 17.4 - Urgency Justifies Ex Parte Relief\n13.2 The Applicant claims urgency justifies ex parte relief. The urgency was manufactured: (1) Two-month delay (mid-June to August) contradicts urgency; (2) Card cancellation day after my cooperation shows consciousness of guilt; (3) Systematic sabotage from Feb-Sep shows premeditation and coordination; (4) First Respondent included two days after signing document shows coordination; (5) Alternative remedies available as trustee with \"additional powers.\" The ex parte relief was obtained to prevent the First Respondent and me from exposing the material non-disclosures, false statements (perjury), and systematic fraud.\n---\n### 14. RESPONSE TO REMAINING AD PARAGRAPHS (18.3, 20, 22, 40.9.4, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, 88)\n#### AD 18.3 - Continual Unauthorized Fund Transfers\n14.1 The Applicant alleges continual unauthorized transfers. The unauthorized transfers were made by the Applicant: R450,000 on 14 Feb 2025 + R450,000 on 15 Feb 2025 = R900,000 total from RegimA SA without my authority as co-director (Annexure **DF9**). RegimA SA account: opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 within one month despite 169 customer deposits R566,598.57 proving active trade (Annexures **DF10**, **DF11**).\n#### AD 20 - First and Second Respondent Details\n14.2 The Applicant provides the First Respondent's and my details.

The gross abuse includes: (1) Applicant made R900K unauthorized transfers as director without my authority as co-director; (2) Applicant cancelled cards without notice as director, rendering documentation inaccessible; (3) Applicant used trustee position to attack beneficiaries who exposed fraud; (4) Mr. Bantjies used trustee position to dismiss audit and facilitate fraud while owing R18.685M; (5) Ms. Farrar used administrative position to control systems, divert revenue, facilitate son's competing domain, and claim to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions.\n#### AD 44 - Applicant Identity Details\n14.5 The Applicant confirms identity. The Applicant's actual position: (1) No access to email (pete@regima.com controlled by Ms. Farrar, Annexure **SF2**); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar using Applicant's email); (4) Debtor to Mr. Bantjies (R18.685M due May 2026, May 2027, May 2029); (5) Figurehead while Ms. Farrar claims to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions (Annexure **SF4**).\n#### AD 50 - Registered Address Details\n14.6 The Applicant provides address: 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview.

The visit occurred after: (1) I provided comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025 (Annexure **DF3**); (2) I exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator who owed R18.685M to trust); (3) Applicant cancelled cards on 7 June 2025 (day after my cooperation, Annexure **DF4**). Mr. Bantjies \"discovered\" irregularities after I reported fraud to him. Mr. Bantjies then dismissed my audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\" Mr. Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery.\n#### AD 83 - Irregular Payments Discovery\n14.9 The Applicant describes discovery of irregular payments. The irregular payments include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers by Applicant (14-15 Feb 2025) without my authority as co-director; (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics (same type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments, transfer pricing scheme); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments (SARS audit email, Annexure **SF4**); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023 (Ms. Farrar falsely claimed paid to First Respondent on 15 May 2025).\n#### AD 88 - Follow-up Actions\n14.10 The Applicant describes follow-up actions. The follow-up actions demonstrate systematic sabotage coordinated with Mr. Bantjies: (1) 7 Jun: Card cancellation (day after my cooperation); (2) 10 Jun: Mr. Bantjies dismisses my audit request; (3) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage (destroying R34.9M operations); (4) 11 Aug: First Respondent deceived into signing document; (5) 13 Aug: First Respondent included in interdict (2 days later); (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied (R1.73M transferred). Each action was retaliation against First Respondent (15 May debt inquiry) and me (6 Jun fraud exposure).\n---\n### 15. PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n15.1 I respectfully request that this Honourable Court:\n15.1.1 Set aside the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025 on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements (perjury), and abuse of process.\n15.1.2 Dismiss the Applicant's application for delinquency or probation orders against the First Respondent and me.\n15.1.3 Grant a counter-application declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008, on the grounds of:\n- Intentional harm to companies through systematic six-month sabotage campaign (Feb-Sep 2025);\n- Grossly negligent conduct in card cancellation without notice rendering documentation inaccessible;\n- Breach of fiduciary duty to me as co-director (unauthorized R900K transfers) and as beneficiary (attacking me after fraud exposure);\n- Abuse of court process through material non-disclosures and false statements (perjury regarding UK payment flows);\n- Systematic destruction of R34.9M profitable operations I built with murdered partner Kayla.\n15.1.4 Order an independent forensic audit by an impartial auditor (not Mr. Bantjies or anyone connected to him) to investigate:\n- Mr. Bantjies's conflicts of interest (Trustee + Debtor R18.685M + Accountant + Company Controller);\n- R5.4 million stock transfer pricing scheme (Strategic Logistics \u2192 Adderory \u2192 RegimA Skin Treatments);\n- R1,035,000 debt to Kayla Pretorius's estate unpaid since Feb 2023;\n- Two years of unallocated expenses while Ms. Farrar controlled systems, Linda was employed as bookkeeper, and Mr. Bantjies was accountant/trustee;\n- Unauthorized R900,000 transfers without my authority as co-director;\n- Revenue diversion scheme (1 Mar, 14 Apr, 11 Sep 2025);\n- Ms. Farrar's control of systems using Applicant's email and Adderory's role in competing domain and stock supply;\n- Court order seizing Kayla's email during law enforcement investigation.\n15.1.5 Order the Applicant to pay the costs of this application on the scale as between attorney and client.\n15.1.6 Grant such further and/or alternative relief as this Honourable Court deems fit.\n---\n### 16. CONCLUSION\n16.1 The evidence presented in this affidavit demonstrates that I built and managed 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually with my late partner, Kayla Pretorius. Kayla was murdered on 13 July 2023. After her death, I continued managing the operations profitably.\n16.2 On 30 March 2025, Ms. Farrar and the Applicant dumped two years of unallocated expenses into RegimA Worldwide Distribution and demanded I sign off within 12 hours. I used the deadline extension (until 6 June) to finalize reports and uncover fraud.\n16.3 On 6 June 2025, I cooperated with the Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies regarding Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC. My analysis revealed an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group. I unknowingly reported fraud to one of the perpetrators\u2014Mr. Bantjies, who owed R18.685 million to the trust.\n16.4 One day after my cooperation, on 7 June 2025, the Applicant cancelled 15 UK business cards without notice, rendering documentation inaccessible. Four days after my fraud exposure, on 10 June 2025, Mr. Bantjies dismissed my audit request, stating he was \"going on holiday.\"\n16.5 The systematic sabotage campaign included: unauthorized R900,000 transfers (14-15 Feb), revenue diversions (1 Mar, 14 Apr), Shopify data expungement (22 May, 100% audit data loss), domain theft by Ms. Farrar's son's company (29 May), card cancellation (7 Jun), warehouse sabotage (8 Jul), and account emptying (11 Sep, R1.73M transferred).\n16.6 The ex parte order was obtained through material non-disclosures and false statements, including Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status, his R18.685 million debt to the trust, the timeline showing card cancellation one day after my cooperation, false statements about UK payment flows (perjury\u2014UK funded SA, not the reverse), and the omission of the R34.9 million revenue context.\n16.7 I support an independent forensic audit by an impartial party (not Mr. Bantjies). Such an audit would reveal the systematic fraud, conflicts of interest, transfer pricing manipulation, and abuse of process that underlie this application.\n16.8 Despite six months of systematic sabotage, I was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied on 11 September 2025. I respectfully submit that the balance of convenience overwhelmingly favors setting aside the ex parte order and granting the relief sought in this affidavit.\n---\n**SIGNED at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025.**\n---\n**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT**  \nSecond Respondent\n---\n**THUS SIGNED AND SWORN TO before me at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025, the Deponent having acknowledged that he knows and understands the contents of this Affidavit, that he has no objection to taking the prescribed oath, and that he considers the oath to be binding on his conscience.**\n---\n**COMMISSIONER OF OATHS**\n---\n## LIST OF ANNEXURES\n**DF1:** Shopify operations overview (51+ stores, R34.9M revenue)  \n**DF2:** Villa Via fraud analysis (86% profit margin)  \n**DF3:** Email correspondence with Bantjies (6 June 2025)  \n**DF4:** Card cancellation records (7 June 2025)  \n**DF5-DF7:** Shopify invoices (UK \u2192 SA payment flow, R84,661+ annually)  \n**DF8:** UK bank transactions (corroborating Shopify payments)  \n**DF9:** Unauthorized transfer records (R450K + R450K = R900K, 14-15 Feb 2025)  \n**DF10:** RegimA SA account statements (opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08)  \n**DF11:** Customer deposit records (169 deposits, R566,598.57)  \n**DF12:** Revenue diversion documentation (1 Mar, 14 Apr, 11 Sep 2025)  \n**DF13:** Warehouse sabotage instruction (8 July 2025)  \n**DF14:** Expense dumping documentation (30 Mar 2025)\n**JF2:** Email correspondence re R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025)  \n**JF4:** Domain registration records (regimaskin.co.za, 29 May 2025)  \n**JF7:** Personal card statements (substitution to prevent collapse)\n**SF1:** Bantjies debt documentation (R18.685M, investment payout schedule)  \n**SF2:** Sage screenshots (Rynette using pete@regima.com, June & Aug 2025)  \n**SF3:** Strategic Logistics R5.4M stock adjustment documentation  \n**SF4:** SARS audit email (Rynette claiming Bantjies instructed payments)  \n**SF5:** Adderory company registration and stock supply documentation  \n**SF6:** Kayla Pretorius estate documentation (R1,035,000 debt)  \n**SF7:** Court order seizing Kayla's email account  \n**SF8:** Linda employment records (bookkeeper)\n---\n**END OF AFFIDAVIT**",

INTRODUCTION AND CAPACITY\n1.1 I am the First Respondent in this matter, an adult female, and a South African citizen residing at 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview.\n1.2 I am a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust (IT 3651/2013) and a Beneficiary of the same trust. I am also a co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (2017/087935/07) and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (2011/005722/07), both of which are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust.\n1.3 The facts deposed to in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and belief, save where the context indicates otherwise, and are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\n1.4 Where I make legal submissions, I do so on the advice of my legal representatives.\n---\n### 2. PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT\n2.1 This affidavit is filed in response to the Applicant's founding affidavit and the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025.\n2.2 I oppose the relief sought by the Applicant and seek to have the ex parte order set aside on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n2.3 I address each of the Applicant's allegations in the order they appear in the founding affidavit, following the AD paragraph sequence.\n---\n### 3. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 1-3.13: PARTIES AND STRUCTURE\n#### AD 1 - Director Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n3.1 The Applicant invokes provisions relating to director liability for breach of fiduciary duty. I note that the accounting system used to track the alleged breaches was controlled by Rynette Farrar using the Applicant's email address (pete@regima.com), as evidenced by Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 (Annexure **SF2**). The Applicant himself had no access to this system.\n#### AD 1.3 - Applicant's Personal Details and Declaration\n3.2 The Applicant's personal details are noted. I observe that this affidavit was commissioned by Danie Jacobus Bantjies, identified as \"our accountant.\" The full extent of Mr. Bantjies's roles will become apparent through the evidence presented herein.\n#### AD 2 - Company Business Conduct Requirements\n3.3 The Applicant alleges reckless or grossly negligent business conduct. The financial performance of the companies demonstrates the contrary. The Second Respondent and his late partner, Kayla Pretorius, built 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. RegimA SA operates 25 stores with R8.5 million turnover, while RegimA Zone operates 26 stores with R26.4 million turnover. The businesses were highly profitable under the Second Respondent's management.\n#### AD 2.4 - Parties to the Application - Introduction\n3.4 The Applicant introduces the parties. The corporate structure reveals that certain entities are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust, which has three trustees. Two are identified in the founding affidavit: the Applicant and myself. The third trustee's identity was not disclosed to the beneficiaries until recently.\n#### AD 3 - Court Order for Probation of Directors/Members\n3.5 The Applicant seeks probation orders under Section 162 of the Companies Act. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence will demonstrate that the accountant who allegedly \"discovered\" the irregularities has multiple undisclosed roles that create impermissible conflicts.\n#### AD 3.2 - Respondents - Wife\n3.6 I am correctly identified as the Applicant's wife and First Respondent. On 15 May 2025, I confronted Rynette Farrar regarding a debt of R1,035,000 owed by RegimA Skin Treatments CC to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd since February 2023 (Annexure **JF2**). These funds were part of Kayla Pretorius's estate. I informed Ms. Farrar that keeping these funds would constitute profiting from the proceeds of murder. This confrontation proved significant in the events that followed.\n#### AD 3.4 - Respondents - Son\n3.7 The Second Respondent is correctly identified as the Applicant's son. On 6 June 2025, the Second Respondent cooperated with the Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports to the accountant regarding Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC, which is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust (Annexure **DF3**). The Second Respondent unknowingly reported fraud to one of the perpetrators.\n#### AD 3.4.2 - Third Respondent - RegimA Skin Treatments\n3.8 RegimA Skin Treatments CC (B1992/005371/23) owes R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, part of Kayla Pretorius's estate, since February 2023. When I raised this debt on 15 May 2025, Ms. Farrar claimed it was paid\u2014a statement I have since determined to be false. RegimA Skin Treatments receives stock from Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure **SF5**).\n#### AD 3.6 - Fourth Respondent - Regim A UK\n3.9 RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). This contradicts claims made later in the founding affidavit regarding UK entities owing money to SA operations.\n#### AD 3.6.1 - Fifth Respondent - Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC\n3.10 Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC (1996/004451/23) is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. Financial analysis reveals an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group\u2014an excessive profit extraction (Annexure **DF2**). This was the fraud the Second Respondent reported to the accountant on 6 June 2025.\n#### AD 3.6.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Villa Via Arcadia\n3.11 Property registration confirms trust ownership. The trust has three trustees, but only two were known to the beneficiaries at the time of this application.\n#### AD 3.7 - Sixth Respondent - Strategic Logistics CC\n3.12 Strategic Logistics CC (2008/136496/23) experienced a R5.4 million stock adjustment in 2024\u2014stock that allegedly \"just disappeared\" (Annexure **SF3**). This represents 46% of annual sales (R5.4M on R11.3M sales) and is 10 times the prior year's adjustment. The stock type matches inventory supplied by Adderory (Pty) Ltd to RegimA Skin Treatments.\n#### AD 3.7.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Strategic Logistics\n3.13 Property registration documents are noted. In a SARS audit email concerning the R5.4M stock adjustment, Ms. Farrar claimed that Danie Bantjies instructed her to make the substantial payments related to this transaction (Annexure **SF4**).\n#### AD 3.8 - Seventh Respondent - FirstRand Bank (FNB)\n3.14 FNB holds accounts for the companies. On 14 and 15 February 2025, unauthorized transfers of R450,000 each (R900,000 total) were made from RegimA SA's FNB account without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director (Annexure **DF9**). The account opened with R997,597.94 and closed at R5,284.08 within one month, despite 169 customer deposits totaling R566,598.57 proving active trade (Annexure **DF10**, **DF11**).\n#### AD 3.9 - Eighth and Ninth Respondents\n3.15 ABSA Bank and CIPC are cited. Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution began with an ABSA bank letter dated 14 April 2025 (Annexure **DF12**).\n#### AD 3.11 - Reference to Respondents as Wife and Son\n3.16 The Applicant refers to the Second Respondent and me as \"my wife\" and \"my son.\" Both of us are beneficiaries of the Faucitt Family Trust. I am also a co-trustee. The Trust Property Control Act, 57 of 1988, Section 9(1) requires trustees to act with care, diligence, and skill in the interests of beneficiaries.\n#### AD 3.13 - Court Jurisdiction and Identity Confirmation\n3.17 Jurisdiction is confirmed. The affidavit was commissioned by Danie Bantjies, who signed as \"Commissioner of Oaths.\" Mr. Bantjies's accounting firm is \"Bantjes and Company.\" His full relationship to the trust and companies will be revealed through the evidence presented herein.\n---\n### 4. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTANT DETAILS - BANTJIES CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n#### AD 4 - Accountant Details - Bantjes and Company\n4.1 The Applicant identifies \"our accountant\" as Danie Jacobus Bantjies of \"Bantjes and Company,\" who attended the office in mid-June 2025. What the Applicant does not disclose are the following material facts:\n4.1.1 Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust\u2014a status that was unknown to the beneficiaries, the Second Respondent and myself, until recently.\n4.1.2 Mr. Bantjies is a debtor to the trust, owing R18.685 million on an investment payout schedule with payments due in May 2026, May 2027, and May 2029 (Annexure **SF1**).\n4.1.3 Mr. Bantjies controls the financial systems and gave instructions to Ms. Farrar for multi-million rand transactions, as evidenced by emails (Annexure **SF4**).\n4.1.4 Mr. Bantjies was \"running the companies\" when the Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud on 6 June 2025.\n4.1.5 Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\"\n4.2 This creates an impermissible conflict of interest: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant + Company Controller. Mr. Bantjies had a direct financial interest in preventing discovery of the fraud the Second Respondent reported.\n---\n### 5. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1-6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE\n#### AD 6.1 - Relationships Between Parties\n5.1 The Applicant describes family and corporate relationships. The evidence demonstrates a different control structure. Ms. Farrar controlled all bank accounts (the Applicant had no access), controlled the Sage accounting system using the Applicant's email (pete@regima.com), and claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions rather than the Applicant's (Annexure **SF2**). Ms. Farrar's sister, Linda, was employed as bookkeeper, yet two years of expenses remained unallocated until 30 March 2025 (Annexure **SF8**).\n#### AD 6.3 - Directors and Members of Respondent Entities\n5.2 The Applicant describes directorships. The Second Respondent and I are co-directors of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd. RegimA Worldwide Distribution is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. On 30 March 2025, Ms. Farrar and the Applicant dumped two years of unallocated expenses into RegimA Worldwide Distribution and demanded the Second Respondent sign off within 12 hours for SARS VAT and Annual Accounts (Annexure **DF14**). The Second Respondent used this deadline extension (until 6 June) to finalize reports and uncover the Villa Via fraud.\n#### AD 6.5 - Banking and Registration of Respondent Entities\n5.3 The Applicant describes banking arrangements. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to any bank accounts; (2) Ms. Farrar controlled all accounts; (3) Revenue diversion for RegimA SA started 1 March 2025; (4) Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution started 14 April 2025 (ABSA bank letter); (5) On 11 September 2025, R1.73 million was transferred from accounts (Annexure **DF12**).\n---\n### 6. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7-7.20: URGENCY AND ALLEGED MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 7 - Urgency and Delay Considerations\n6.1 The Applicant claims urgency. The timeline reveals: (1) Alleged discovery mid-June 2025; (2) Application filed August 2025; (3) Two-month delay contradicts urgency. The actual urgency relates to the Second Respondent's fraud exposure on 6 June and my debt inquiry on 15 May.\n#### AD 7.3 - Urgency Details\n6.2 The Applicant claims the accountant noted \"numerous discrepancies\" and \"irregular payments\" in mid-June 2025. Timeline analysis reveals: 6 June 2025 (Second Respondent provides comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies), 7 June 2025 (Applicant cancels 15 UK business cards without notice). The card cancellation occurred one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation, not \"following\" any discovery. This demonstrates that the Applicant created the problem he now complains about.\n#### AD 7.6 - Financial Impact of Misconduct\n6.3 The Applicant alleges financial impact. The actual financial sabotage included: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) Revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025; (3) Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025 (100% audit data loss, seven days after my confrontation with Ms. Farrar); (4) Card cancellation 7 June 2025; (5) Domain theft 29 May 2025 (regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory, 14 days after my confrontation, Annexure **JF4**); (6) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 (R34.9M operations destroyed).\n#### AD 7.8 - Continuing Harm to Corporations\n6.4 The Applicant claims continuing harm. The harm was systematically inflicted. An email from Gee dated 20 June 2025 states she was instructed to send a \"don't use regima.zone only use regimaskin.co.za\" email (Annexure **JF8**). The domain regimaskin.co.za is owned by Adderory (Pty) Ltd (Ms. Farrar's son's company), not by RegimA. This diverted customers from the Second Respondent's platforms to a competing domain controlled by Ms. Farrar's family.\n#### AD 7.10 - Card Cancellations and Service Interruptions\n6.5 The Applicant claims he cancelled cards in June 2025 \"following\" the accountant's discovery and requested invoices from the Second Respondent. Timeline evidence demonstrates: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent provides comprehensive reports; (2) 7 June: Applicant cancels UK cards (5191, 5225) paying for Shopify subscriptions (Annexure **DF4**); (3) Cards cancelled one day after cooperation, not after any discovery. The cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible (card-based authentication), then the Applicant complained about missing documentation.\n#### AD 7.13 - Domain and Service Halts Due to Card Cancellations\n6.6 The Applicant claims subscriptions were halted due to card cancellations. To prevent business collapse, the Second Respondent substituted his personal card (1927) for RegimA SA and I substituted my personal card (3212) for RegimA Zone (Annexure **JF7**). Meanwhile, the competing domain regimaskin.co.za was actively diverting customers.\n#### AD 7.16 - Son's Interference with Business Operations\n6.7 The Applicant alleges the Second Respondent interfered with operations. The evidence demonstrates the Second Respondent built and managed 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually (Annexure **DF1**). The Second Respondent's partner, Kayla Pretorius, co-built these operations before her murder on 13 July 2023. After Kayla's death, a court order was obtained to seize her email account (kayp@rzo.io), which interfered with a law enforcement investigation that had instructed a freeze on the account (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.18 - Email and Account Access Interference\n6.8 The Applicant claims the Second Respondent restricted email access. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to his own email (pete@regima.com)\u2014controlled by Ms. Farrar; (2) Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 show Ms. Farrar using the Applicant's email (Annexure **SF2**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's; (4) Kayla's email was seized by court order after her murder (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.20 - Continued Interference Not in Corporate Interests\n6.9 The Applicant claims interference is not in corporate interests. The corporate interests were served by the Second Respondent's profitable operations (R34.9M annually). The interference came from: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Domain theft; (6) Warehouse sabotage. Each action occurred after either my debt inquiry (15 May) or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June).\n---\n### 7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 8.4-9.3: FINANCIAL DISCREPANCIES AND MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 8.4 - Discovery of Financial Discrepancies\n7.1 The Applicant claims the accountant discovered discrepancies. The accountant, Mr. Bantjies, is also: (1) Undisclosed trustee; (2) Debtor owing R18.685M; (3) Controller of financial systems; (4) Recipient of the Second Respondent's fraud report on 6 June 2025. Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025. The \"discovery\" occurred after the Second Respondent exposed fraud to the person facilitating it.\n#### AD 8.5 - Accountant's Attendance and Findings\n7.2 The Applicant states Mr. Bantjies attended for provisional tax and VAT submissions. The two years of unallocated expenses (dumped into RegimA Worldwide Distribution on 30 March 2025) occurred while: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled the accounting system using the Applicant's email; (2) Linda (Ms. Farrar's sister) was employed as bookkeeper (Annexure **SF8**); (3) Mr. Bantjies was the accountant. The question arises: why were expenses unallocated for two years if the accountant and bookkeeper were performing their duties?\n#### AD 8.7 - IT Expenses and Tax Problems\n7.3 The Applicant cites IT expenses: 2024 tax year R6,738,007.47; 2025 tax year R2,116,159.47. The Applicant claims these are \"almost entirely unexplainable.\" The context omitted from the founding affidavit is that these expenses supported 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. The IT expenses represent 19.3% of revenue (2024) and 6.1% of revenue (2025)\u2014reasonable for a global e-commerce operation. The Applicant fails to disclose the revenue context.\n#### AD 8.10 - International Expenses and Tax Implications\n7.4 The Applicant claims expenses are \"seemingly international\" and accounts have \"almost exceeded the yearly allowable quota for funds leaving South Africa.\" The Shopify platforms were funded by UK company RegimA Zone Ltd (company 10697009). UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The international expenses were legitimate costs of UK-owned e-commerce operations.\n#### AD 9.2 - Bank Message Regarding International Transfers\n7.5 The Applicant references bank messages about international transfers. The actual international payment flow is demonstrated by Shopify invoices: UK entities (RegimA Zone Ltd) funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The payment direction is UK \u2192 SA, not SA \u2192 UK as the Applicant's affidavit implies.\n#### AD 9.3 - Financial Misconduct Summary\n7.6 The Applicant summarizes alleged misconduct. The documented financial misconduct includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) without the Second Respondent's authority; (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments (Annexure **SF3**, **SF5**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments for this stock (SARS audit email, Annexure **SF4**); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023, unpaid despite Ms. Farrar's false claim to me that it was paid (Annexure **JF2**, **SF6**).\n---\n### 8. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1-10.14: APPLICATION TO DECLARE RESPONDENTS DELINQUENT\n#### AD 10.1 - Relief Sought - Delinquency or Probation\n8.1 The Applicant seeks delinquency or probation orders under Section 162. The evidence establishes grounds for the Applicant's own delinquency: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers in breach of fiduciary duty as co-director; (2) Card cancellation sabotage one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation; (3) False statements about UK payment flows; (4) Abuse of ex parte process through material non-disclosures.\n#### AD 10.3 - Delinquent Conduct of Respondents\n8.2 The Applicant alleges delinquent conduct by the Second Respondent and me. My actual conduct included: (1) Fulfilling fiduciary duty as trustee by investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025); (2) Confronting Ms. Farrar about profiting from proceeds of murder; (3) Being deceived by co-trustees into signing \"Main Trustee\" document (11 Aug 2025, Annexure **JF5**); (4) Being punished with interdict two days later (13 Aug 2025, Annexure **JF6**).\n#### AD 10.4 - Contravention of Companies Act\n8.3 The Applicant alleges Companies Act contraventions. Section 76(3)(b) requires directors to act in good faith and for a proper purpose. The Applicant's actions demonstrate bad faith: (1) Manufactured crisis (card cancellation day after cooperation); (2) Material non-disclosures in ex parte application; (3) False statements about UK operations; (4) Systematic sabotage of profitable businesses.\n#### AD 10.5.2 - Probation Relief Under Section 162\n8.4 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence reveals: Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) commissioned this affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths. Mr. Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery of the fraud the Second Respondent reported.\n#### AD 10.6 - Close Corporations Act - Fiduciary Duties\n8.5 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act fiduciary duties. The Act requires members to manage in the corporation's interest. RegimA Skin Treatments (CC) owes R1,035,000 to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023. Strategic Logistics (CC) lost R5.4M in stock that \"disappeared\"\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory. These transactions were not in the corporations' interests.\n#### AD 10.6.1 - Member's Duty to Manage in Corporation's Interest\n8.6 The Applicant cites duty to manage in corporation's interest. The R5.4M stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics represents 46% of annual sales\u201410 times the historical adjustment. Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments. This transaction was not in Strategic Logistics' interest.\n#### AD 10.6.2 - Member's Duty Not to Exceed Powers\n8.7 The Applicant cites duty not to exceed powers. The unauthorized R900,000 transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) were made without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director. The Applicant exceeded his powers by acting unilaterally.\n#### AD 10.6.3 - Member's Duty to Avoid Conflicts of Interest\n8.8 The Applicant cites duty to avoid conflicts. The evidence reveals multiple conflicts: (1) Mr. Bantjies: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant; (2) Ms. Farrar's son (Adderory) supplying stock to RegimA Skin Treatments while same stock type \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) Villa Via (trust-owned) charging 86% profit margin rent to group; (4) Regimaskin.co.za (owned by Ms. Farrar's son) competing with RegimA operations.\n#### AD 10.7 - Member Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n8.9 The Applicant invokes breach of fiduciary duty liability. The breaches are established: (1) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to the Second Respondent (co-director) by unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries (as trustee) by attacking them with interdict; (3) Mr. Bantjies breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries by dismissing audit request and facilitating fraud.\n#### AD 10.7.1.2 - Liability for Economic Benefit Derived\n8.10 The Applicant cites liability for economic benefit. The economic benefits derived include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (4) 86% profit margin on Villa Via rent; (5) Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za (Adderory).\n#### AD 10.7.1.4 - Liability for Loss Suffered by Corporation\n8.11 The Applicant cites liability for corporate loss. The losses suffered include: (1) RegimA SA: R900K unauthorized transfers, revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025, Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025; (2) RegimA Zone: Customer diversion to competing domain, card cancellation sabotage; (3) Strategic Logistics: R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (4) RegimA Worldwide: Forced to pay 2 years of unallocated expenses from all companies.\n#### AD 10.8 - Disqualification for Misconduct Under Section 47\n8.12 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act Section 47 disqualification. This section applies when a member is guilty of gross negligence or fraud. The R5.4M stock adjustment (46% of sales, 10x historical) in Strategic Logistics, with Ms. Farrar claiming Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments, and the same stock type supplied by Adderory, suggests systematic fraud.\n#### AD 10.8.1 - Declaration of Delinquency as Alternative Relief\n8.13 The Applicant seeks delinquency declaration. The evidence supports declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5): (1) Intentional harm to companies (systematic sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent conduct (card cancellation without notice); (3) Breach of trust (attacking beneficiaries as trustee); (4) Abuse of process (ex parte order based on material non-disclosures and false statements).\n#### AD 10.9 - Mandatory Disqualification Under Section 162(5)\n8.14 The Applicant invokes Section 162(5) mandatory disqualification grounds. These grounds apply to the Applicant's conduct: (1) Intentional harm to companies (R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent harm (card cancellation rendering documentation inaccessible); (3) Breach of trust (trustee attacking beneficiaries).\n#### AD 10.9.2 - Intentional or Grossly Negligent Harm\n8.15 The Applicant alleges intentional or grossly negligent harm by respondents. The intentional harm was inflicted by the Applicant and his co-conspirators: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent cooperates; (2) 7 June: Cards cancelled; (3) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days after my inquiry); (4) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days after my inquiry); (5) 8 July: Warehouse sabotaged; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action followed either my debt inquiry or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure.\n#### AD 10.9.3 - Manner of Acting - Gross Negligence or Misconduct\n8.16 The Applicant alleges gross negligence or misconduct. The gross negligence is demonstrated by: Cancelling 15 business cards without notice, rendering documentation inaccessible, then complaining about missing documentation. This demonstrates consciousness of guilt and bad faith.\n#### AD 10.9.3.1 - Gross Negligence or Wilful Misconduct\n8.17 The Applicant alleges wilful misconduct. The wilful misconduct includes: (1) Systematic revenue diversion (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (2) Data destruction (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Card sabotage (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). This six-month campaign occurred after I investigated fraud and the Second Respondent exposed fraud.\n#### AD 10.9.3.2 - Acquiescence to Fraudulent Acts\n8.18 The Applicant alleges acquiescence to fraud. The acquiescence to fraud includes: (1) Two years of unallocated expenses while Ms. Farrar controlled systems using the Applicant's email and Linda was employed as bookkeeper; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" with Mr. Bantjies allegedly instructing payments; (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate unpaid since Feb 2023; (4) Villa Via 86% profit margin rent extraction.\n#### AD 10.9.3.3 - Party to Omission with Fraudulent Purpose\n8.19 The Applicant alleges omission with fraudulent purpose. The omissions with fraudulent purpose include: (1) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's trustee status from affidavit; (2) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Applicant omitted R34.9M revenue context for IT expenses; (4) Applicant omitted UK \u2192 SA payment flow (claimed opposite); (5) Applicant omitted timeline showing card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation; (6) Applicant omitted my debt inquiry and subsequent retaliation.\n#### AD 10.10 - Probation Under Section 162(7)\n8.20 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162(7). This section applies when conduct is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) I fulfilled fiduciary duty by investigating debt, then was punished with interdict; (2) Second Respondent exposed fraud to accountant, then suffered six-month sabotage campaign; (3) Both excluded from profitable businesses we built.\n#### AD 10.10.2.3 - Oppressive or Prejudicial Exercise of Powers\n8.21 The Applicant alleges oppressive exercise of powers. The oppressive exercise of powers includes: (1) Applicant used trustee powers to attack beneficiaries; (2) Mr. Bantjies used trustee powers to dismiss audit request and facilitate fraud; (3) Applicant used director powers to make unauthorized R900K transfers; (4) Applicant used court process to obtain ex parte order based on material non-disclosures.\n#### AD 10.10.2.4 - Conduct with Oppressive or Prejudicial Result\n8.22 The Applicant alleges conduct with prejudicial result. The prejudicial results include: (1) I was excluded from companies after investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent excluded from R34.9M operations he built; (3) Customers diverted to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son; (4) R900K transferred without authorization; (5) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (6) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate unpaid.\n#### AD 10.10.22 - Business Conducted in Oppressive Manner\n8.23 The Applicant alleges oppressive business conduct. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled all systems using Applicant's email while claiming to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions; (2) Applicant had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems; (3) Two years of expenses unallocated despite employed bookkeeper; (4) Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) dismissed fraud investigation.\n#### AD 10.10.41 - Conduct Inconsistent with Duties\n8.24 The Applicant alleges conduct inconsistent with duties. The conduct inconsistent with duties includes: (1) Trustee attacking beneficiaries (Applicant, Mr. Bantjies); (2) Director making unauthorized transfers (Applicant); (3) Trustee dismissing fraud investigation (Mr. Bantjies); (4) Accountant facilitating fraud while being debtor (Mr. Bantjies); (5) Administrator controlling systems while diverting revenue (Ms. Farrar).\n#### AD 10.13 - Unaccounted Money - Significant Sums\n8.25 The Applicant alleges unaccounted money. The unaccounted money includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023; (4) R1.73 million transferred 11 Sep 2025; (5) Two years of unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide on 30 Mar 2025.\n#### AD 10.14 - Full Extent of Transgressions Not Yet Determined\n8.26 The Applicant claims full extent not yet determined. The full extent includes: (1) Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email; (4) Ms. Farrar's son's competing domain; (5) Adderory's stock supply relationship; (6) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme; (7) Court order seizing Kayla's email during law enforcement investigation.\n---\n### 9. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 11.2-12.4: UK OPERATIONS AND ALLEGED FRAUD\n#### AD 11.2 - UK Head Office - RegimA UK Ltd\n9.1 The Applicant describes UK operations. RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The UK company is the economic owner of the e-commerce operations.\n#### AD 11.3 - Directors of UK Entity\n9.2 The Applicant describes UK directors. The UK company was established by the Second Respondent and Kayla to own and operate the global e-commerce platforms. After Kayla's murder (13 July 2023), the Second Respondent continued managing the operations.\n#### AD 11.4 - Applicant's Role in Operations\n9.3 The Applicant describes his role. The evidence demonstrates the Applicant had no operational role: (1) No access to email (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (4) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's. The Applicant appears to be a figurehead.\n#### AD 11.6 - UK Branch Operations\n9.4 The Applicant describes UK branch operations. The UK company funded SA operations through Shopify subscription payments. Shopify invoices demonstrate UK \u2192 SA payment flow of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The UK company invested in SA operations, not the reverse.\n#### AD 11.8 - UK Financial Concerns\n9.5 The Applicant expresses UK financial concerns. The financial concerns were manufactured: (1) Card cancellation 7 June 2025 disrupted UK funding; (2) Domain theft 29 May 2025 diverted customers; (3) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 destroyed UK-funded operations; (4) Data expungement 22 May 2025 eliminated audit trail.\n#### AD 12.1 - UK Branch Non-Payment and Fraud Concerns\n9.6 The Applicant alleges UK branch non-payment and fraud. The Shopify invoices prove the opposite: UK entities funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). UK bank transactions corroborate the invoices (Annexure **DF8**). The Applicant's statement is demonstrably false.\n#### AD 12.2 - Misappropriation Leading to Insolvency Risk\n9.7 The Applicant alleges misappropriation leading to insolvency. The actual insolvency risk was created by: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (3) Data expungement (22 May); (4) Card cancellation (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). Despite six months of sabotage, the Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied.\n#### AD 12.3 - Purpose of Court Application\n9.8 The Applicant states the purpose is to prevent further harm. The actual purpose appears to be: (1) Punish me for investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May); (2) Punish Second Respondent for exposing Villa Via fraud (6 June); (3) Seize control of R34.9M operations Second Respondent built; (4) Prevent forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and the systematic fraud.\n#### AD 12.4 - Alternative Roles for Wife and Son\n9.9 The Applicant suggests alternative roles for the Second Respondent and me. The evidence demonstrates: (1) I fulfilled trustee duties by investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent built and managed R34.9M profitable operations; (3) Both were systematically sabotaged after investigating/exposing fraud; (4) Both were attacked with interdict by co-trustees; (5) I was included in interdict two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document.\n---\n### 10. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 13.2-13.8: REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERDICTORY RELIEF\n#### AD 13.2 - Clear Right Not to Be Prejudiced\n10.1 The Applicant claims clear right not to be prejudiced. The Applicant has no clear right: (1) He manufactured the crisis (card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (2) He made unauthorized R900K transfers; (3) He had alternative remedies as trustee with \"additional powers\"; (4) He obtained order through material non-disclosures (Mr. Bantjies's trustee status, debtor status, timeline manipulation, UK payment flow misrepresentation).\n#### AD 13.2.2 - Injury Sustained and Apprehension of Further Harm\n10.2 The Applicant claims injury and apprehension of harm. The Applicant suffered no injury he didn't inflict on himself: (1) Card cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible; (2) Unauthorized transfers depleted accounts; (3) Revenue diversions reduced cash flow; (4) Warehouse sabotage destroyed operations. The apprehension of further harm was manufactured to justify ex parte relief.\n#### AD 13.3 - Reasonable Apprehension of Irreparable Harm\n10.3 The Applicant claims reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm. The irreparable harm was inflicted by the Applicant's six-month sabotage campaign: (1) R34.9M operations destroyed (93.3% revenue collapse); (2) Customer relationships diverted to competing domain; (3) Audit data expunged (100% loss); (4) Documentation rendered inaccessible; (5) Accounts emptied. The Second Respondent and I suffered irreparable harm, not the Applicant.\n#### AD 13.4 - Interdicts Essential for Corporation Survival\n10.4 The Applicant claims interdicts essential for survival. The corporations were profitable under the Second Respondent's management (R34.9M annually). The survival threat came from the Applicant's sabotage: (1) Unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data destruction; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Excluding the Second Respondent and me threatened survival, not ensured it.\n#### AD 13.5 - Balance of Convenience Favours Granting Relief\n10.5 The Applicant claims balance of convenience favors relief. The balance overwhelmingly favors the Second Respondent and me: (1) We built and managed profitable operations; (2) We investigated and exposed fraud; (3) We were systematically sabotaged for doing so; (4) We substituted personal cards to prevent business collapse; (5) We support independent forensic audit. The Applicant obtained relief through material non-disclosures and false statements.\n#### AD 13.8 - Other Relief Sought in Part A\n10.6 The Applicant seeks additional relief. The relief was obtained ex parte based on: (1) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Omitting timeline showing card cancellation day after cooperation; (4) Falsely claiming UK owes SA (opposite is true); (5) Omitting R34.9M revenue context; (6) Omitting my debt inquiry and retaliation pattern.\n---\n### 11. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1-14.5: FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND FORENSIC AUDIT\n#### AD 14.1 - Financial Constraints on Respondents\n11.1 The Applicant seeks financial constraints on the Second Respondent and me. The financial constraints were already imposed through sabotage: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Despite six months of sabotage, the Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors.\n#### AD 14.3 - Constraint to Prevent Financial Prejudice\n11.2 The Applicant seeks constraints to prevent prejudice. The prejudice was inflicted by the Applicant: (1) RegimA SA account opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 (Feb-Mar 2025); (2) 169 customer deposits R566,598.57 proving active trade; (3) R1.73M transferred 11 Sep 2025; (4) R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage.\n#### AD 14.4 - Forensic Audit Necessity and Remuneration\n11.3 The Applicant seeks forensic audit. The Second Respondent and I support independent forensic audit by an impartial party. Such audit would reveal: (1) Mr. Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant); (2) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme (Strategic Logistics \u2192 Adderory \u2192 RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (4) Two years unallocated expenses; (5) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (6) Revenue diversion scheme; (7) Ms. Farrar's control of systems using Applicant's email.\n#### AD 14.5 - Request for Relief Under Part B\n11.4 The Applicant requests Part B relief. The relief should include: (1) Setting aside ex parte order obtained through material non-disclosures; (2) Independent forensic audit; (3) Investigation of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts; (4) Investigation of R5.4M stock \"disappearance\"; (5) Recovery of R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (6) Investigation of Ms. Farrar's control and Adderory's role; (7) Consideration of Applicant's delinquency under Section 162(5).\n---\n### 12. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1-16.12: DISCOVERY AND URGENCY\n#### AD 16.1 - Discovery of Respondents' Conduct\n12.1 The Applicant claims discovery of conduct in mid-June 2025. The actual discovery timeline: (1) 15 May: I discovered R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (2) 6 June: Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies; (3) 7 June: Applicant cancelled cards (day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (4) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed audit request. The Applicant's \"discovery\" was actually consciousness of guilt after the Second Respondent exposed fraud to Mr. Bantjies.\n#### AD 16.2 - R600,000 Transfer as Trigger for Action\n12.2 The Applicant cites R600,000 transfer (later corrected to R500,000) as trigger. The actual triggers were: (1) 15 May: I confronted Ms. Farrar about R1,035,000 debt and \"profiting from proceeds of murder\"; (2) 6 June: Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed audit request. The R500,000 transfer is a pretext.\n#### AD 16.5 - Unawareness of Urgent Application Process\n12.3 The Applicant claims unawareness of urgent process. The Applicant had access to legal advice and Mr. Bantjies as Commissioner of Oaths. The delay from mid-June to August contradicts urgency. The actual urgency appears to be preventing forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and systematic fraud.\n#### AD 16.6 - Delay Would Have Been Avoided\n12.4 The Applicant claims delay would have been avoided if he knew the process. The two-month delay (mid-June to August) contradicts urgency. The timing suggests: (1) Waiting to see if Second Respondent's audit request would proceed; (2) Coordinating with Mr. Bantjies (who dismissed audit request 10 June); (3) Preparing my punishment (included in interdict 13 Aug, two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document 11 Aug).\n#### AD 16.8 - State of Shock and Delayed Response\n12.5 The Applicant claims state of shock. The Applicant was not in shock\u2014he was executing a systematic sabotage campaign: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping; (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 7 Jun: Card cancellation; (6) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (7) 11 Sep: Account emptying. This is not shock\u2014this is systematic execution.\n#### AD 16.10 - Attorney Consultation Timeline\n12.6 The Applicant describes attorney consultation. The consultation occurred after: (1) My debt inquiry (15 May); (2) Data expungement (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June); (5) Card cancellation (7 June); (6) Mr. Bantjies's audit dismissal (10 June). The legal action was retaliation, not discovery.\n#### AD 16.12 - Need for Urgent Court Assistance\n12.7 The Applicant claims need for urgent assistance. The Applicant had alternative remedies: (1) Trustee with \"additional powers\" as Founder; (2) Could have conducted audit as trustee; (3) Could have consulted with co-trustee (me) instead of attacking me; (4) Could have consulted with co-trustee Mr. Bantjies (who was facilitating the fraud). The Applicant chose ex parte process to avoid disclosure of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and systematic sabotage.\n---\n### 13. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 17.3-17.4: EX PARTE BASIS\n#### AD 17.3 - Ex Parte Basis for Application\n13.1 The Applicant justifies ex parte application. The ex parte process was abused through material non-disclosures: (1) Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Timeline manipulation (card cancellation day after cooperation); (4) UK payment flow misrepresentation (claimed SA \u2192 UK, actually UK \u2192 SA); (5) R34.9M revenue context omission; (6) My debt inquiry and retaliation pattern; (7) Second Respondent's fraud exposure and retaliation pattern; (8) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email; (9) Adderory's competing domain; (10) R5.4M stock \"disappearance.\"\n#### AD 17.4 - Urgency Justifies Ex Parte Relief\n13.2 The Applicant claims urgency justifies ex parte relief. The urgency was manufactured: (1) Two-month delay contradicts urgency; (2) Card cancellation day after cooperation shows consciousness of guilt; (3) Systematic sabotage from Feb-Sep shows premeditation; (4) I was included two days after signing document, showing coordination; (5) Alternative remedies available as trustee. The ex parte relief was obtained to prevent the Second Respondent and me from exposing the material non-disclosures and systematic fraud.\n---\n### 14. RESPONSE TO REMAINING AD PARAGRAPHS (18.3, 20, 22, 40.9.4, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, 88)\n#### AD 18.3 - Continual Unauthorized Fund Transfers\n14.1 The Applicant alleges continual unauthorized transfers. The unauthorized transfers were made by the Applicant: R450,000 on 14 Feb 2025 + R450,000 on 15 Feb 2025 = R900,000 total from RegimA SA without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director. RegimA SA account: opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 within one month despite 169 customer deposits R566,598.57.\n#### AD 20 - First and Second Respondent Details\n14.2 The Applicant provides the Second Respondent's and my details. The details omitted include: (1) I confronted Ms. Farrar about R1,035,000 debt on 15 May 2025; (2) I was deceived into signing \"Main Trustee\" document on 11 Aug 2025; (3) I was included in interdict on 13 Aug 2025 (two days later); (4) Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud on 6 June 2025; (5) Second Respondent suffered six-month sabotage campaign; (6) Second Respondent built R34.9M profitable operations with murdered partner Kayla.\n#### AD 22 - Additional Party Information\n14.3 The Applicant provides additional information. The information omitted includes: (1) Faucitt Family Trust has three trustees: Applicant, me, Mr. Bantjies; (2) Mr. Bantjies's trustee status was unknown to beneficiaries; (3) Mr. Bantjies is debtor owing R18.685M; (4) Mr. Bantjies is accountant controlling financial systems; (5) Mr. Bantjies dismissed Second Respondent's audit request; (6) Mr. Bantjies commissioned this affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths.\n#### AD 40.9.4 - Gross Abuse of Director/Member Position\n14.4 The Applicant alleges gross abuse of position. The gross abuse includes: (1) Applicant made R900K unauthorized transfers as director; (2) Applicant cancelled cards without notice as director; (3) Applicant used trustee position to attack beneficiaries; (4) Mr. Bantjies used trustee position to dismiss audit and facilitate fraud; (5) Ms. Farrar used administrative position to control systems, divert revenue, and facilitate son's competing domain.\n#### AD 44 - Applicant Identity Details\n14.5 The Applicant confirms identity. The Applicant's actual position: (1) No access to email (pete@regima.com controlled by Ms. Farrar); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (4) Debtor to Mr. Bantjies (R18.685M due May 2026); (5) Figurehead while Ms. Farrar claims to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions.\n#### AD 50 - Registered Address Details\n14.6 The Applicant provides address: 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview. This is also my address. The Applicant attacked me (co-trustee, beneficiary) with interdict two days after I signed \"Main Trustee\" document, punishing me for investigating R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate and supporting the Second Respondent.\n#### AD 74 - Timeline Context\n14.7 The Applicant provides timeline context. The actual timeline: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping (12-hour deadline); (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 15 May: My debt inquiry; (6) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days later); (7) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days later); (8) 6 Jun: Second Respondent's fraud exposure; (9) 7 Jun: Cards cancelled (1 day later); (10) 10 Jun: Audit dismissed; (11) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotaged; (12) 11 Aug: I sign document; (13) 13 Aug: I included in interdict (2 days later); (14) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied.\n#### AD 78 - Accountant's Office Visit and Discovery\n14.8 The Applicant describes Mr. Bantjies's office visit. The visit occurred after: (1) Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025; (2) Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) Applicant cancelled cards on 7 June 2025 (day after Second Respondent's cooperation). Mr. Bantjies \"discovered\" irregularities after the Second Respondent reported fraud to him. Mr. Bantjies then dismissed audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\"\n#### AD 83 - Irregular Payments Discovery\n14.9 The Applicant describes discovery of irregular payments. The irregular payments include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers by Applicant (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics (same type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments (SARS audit email); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023 (Ms. Farrar falsely claimed paid to me on 15 May 2025).\n#### AD 88 - Follow-up Actions\n14.10 The Applicant describes follow-up actions. The follow-up actions include: (1) 7 Jun: Card cancellation (day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (2) 10 Jun: Mr. Bantjies dismisses audit; (3) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (4) 11 Aug: I was deceived into signing document; (5) 13 Aug: I was included in interdict; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action was retaliation against me (15 May debt inquiry) and the Second Respondent (6 Jun fraud exposure).\n---\n### 15. PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n15.1 I respectfully request that this Honourable Court:\n15.1.1 Set aside the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025 on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n15.1.2 Dismiss the Applicant's application for delinquency or probation orders against the Second Respondent and me.\n15.1.3 Grant a counter-application declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008, on the grounds of:\n- Intentional harm to companies through systematic sabotage;\n- Grossly negligent conduct in card cancellation without notice;\n- Breach of fiduciary duty to beneficiaries as trustee;\n- Abuse of court process through material non-disclosures and false statements.\n15.1.4 Order an independent forensic audit by an impartial auditor to investigate:\n- Mr. Bantjies's conflicts of interest (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant);\n- R5.4 million stock transfer pricing scheme;\n- R1,035,000 debt to Kayla Pretorius's estate;\n- Two years of unallocated expenses;\n- Unauthorized R900,000 transfers;\n- Revenue diversion scheme;\n- Ms. Farrar's control of systems and Adderory's role.\n15.1.5 Order the Applicant to pay the costs of this application on the scale as between attorney and client.\n15.1.6 Grant such further and/or alternative relief as this Honourable Court deems fit.\n---\n### 16. CONCLUSION\n16.1 The evidence presented in this affidavit demonstrates that I fulfilled my fiduciary duties as a trustee by investigating a substantial debt owed to a deceased beneficiary's estate. I confronted Ms. Farrar about this debt on 15 May 2025, stating that keeping the funds would constitute profiting from the proceeds of murder.\n16.2 Within seven days of my inquiry, Shopify data was expunged, eliminating the audit trail. Within 14 days, a competing domain was registered by Ms. Farrar's son's company, diverting customers from the Second Respondent's operations.\n16.3 On 11 August 2025, I was deceived by my co-trustees into signing a \"Main Trustee\" document that backdated the Applicant's designation to 1 July 2025. Two days later, on 13 August 2025, the Applicant and Mr. Bantjies included me in this interdict.\n16.4 The ex parte order was obtained through material non-disclosures, including Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status, his R18.685 million debt to the trust, the timeline showing card cancellation one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation, false statements about UK payment flows, and the omission of the R34.9 million revenue context.\n16.5 The Second Respondent and I support an independent forensic audit by an impartial party. Such an audit would reveal the systematic fraud, conflicts of interest, and abuse of process that underlie this application.\n16.6 I respectfully submit that the balance of convenience overwhelmingly favors setting aside the ex parte order and granting the relief sought in this affidavit.\n---\n**SIGNED at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025.**\n---\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**  \nFirst Respondent\n---\n**THUS SIGNED AND SWORN TO before me at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025, the Deponent having acknowledged that she knows and understands the contents of this Affidavit, that she has no objection to taking the prescribed oath, and that she considers the oath to be binding on her conscience.**\n---\n**COMMISSIONER OF OATHS**\n---\n## LIST OF ANNEXURES\n**JF1:** Trust deed and trustee documentation  \n**JF2:** Email correspondence re R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025)  \n**JF3:** Rynette's false statement documentation  \n**JF4:** Domain registration records (regimaskin.co.za, 29 May 2025)  \n**JF5:** \"Main Trustee\" document (signed 11 Aug 2025, backdated to 1 July 2025)  \n**JF6:** Interdict order (13 Aug 2025)  \n**JF7:** Personal card statements (substitution to prevent collapse)  \n**JF8:** Email from Gee re domain diversion (20 June 2025)\n**DF1:** Shopify operations overview (51+ stores, R34.9M revenue)  \n**DF2:** Villa Via fraud analysis (86% profit margin)  \n**DF3:** Email correspondence with Bantjies (6 June 2025)  \n**DF4:** Card cancellation records (7 June 2025)  \n**DF5-DF7:** Shopify invoices (UK \u2192 SA payment flow, R84,661+ annually)  \n**DF8:** UK bank transactions (corroborating Shopify payments)  \n**DF9:** Unauthorized transfer records (R450K + R450K = R900K, 14-15 Feb 2025)  \n**DF10:** RegimA SA account statements (opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08)  \n**DF11:** Customer deposit records (169 deposits, R566,598.57)  \n**DF12:** Revenue diversion documentation (1 Mar, 14 Apr, 11 Sep 2025)  \n**DF13:** Warehouse sabotage instruction (8 July 2025)  \n**DF14:** Expense dumping documentation (30 Mar 2025)\n**SF1:** Bantjies debt documentation (R18.685M, investment payout schedule)  \n**SF2:** Sage screenshots (Rynette using pete@regima.com, June & Aug 2025)  \n**SF3:** Strategic Logistics R5.4M stock adjustment documentation  \n**SF4:** SARS audit email (Rynette claiming Bantjies instructed payments)  \n**SF5:** Adderory company registration and stock supply documentation  \n**SF6:** Kayla Pretorius estate documentation (R1,035,000 debt)  \n**SF7:** Court order seizing Kayla's email account  \n**SF8:** Linda employment records (bookkeeper)\n---\n**END OF AFFIDAVIT**",

The affidavit will reveal that the accounting system used to track these alleged breaches was controlled by Rynette Farrar using Peter's email address (pete@regima.com), as evidenced by Sage screenshots from June and August 2025. Peter himself had no access to this system. |\n| **AD 1.3** - Applicant's Personal Details and Declaration | Peter provides his ID (520430 5708 18 5) and address. The affidavit is commissioned by Danie Bantjies, identified as \"our accountant.\" Bantjies's full role will progressively emerge through the document. |\n| **AD 2** - Company Business Conduct Requirements | Peter alleges reckless or grossly negligent business conduct. The actual financial performance shows Dan and Kayla built 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. RegimA SA: 25 stores, R8.5M turnover. RegimA Zone: 26 stores, R26.4M turnover. The businesses were highly profitable under Dan's management. |\n| **AD 2.4** - Parties to the Application - Introduction | Peter introduces the parties. The corporate structure will reveal that certain entities are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust (IT 3651/2013), which has three trustees. Two are identified in this affidavit: Peter and Jax. The third trustee's identity was not disclosed to the beneficiaries. |\n| **AD 3** - Court Order for Probation of Directors/Members | Peter seeks probation orders. The Companies Act Section 162 requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence will show that the accountant who \"discovered\" the alleged irregularities has multiple undisclosed roles. |\n| **AD 3.2** - Respondents - Wife | Jax is identified as Peter's wife and First Respondent. On 15 May 2025, Jax confronted Rynette Farrar about a R1,035,000 debt owed by RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance since February 2023. These funds were part of Kayla Pretorius's estate. Jax stated that keeping them would be \"profiting from the proceeds of murder.\" This confrontation will prove significant. |\n| **AD 3.4** - Respondents - Son | Dan is identified as Peter's son and Second Respondent. On 6 June 2025, Dan cooperated with Peter's request by providing comprehensive reports to the accountant regarding Villa Via Arcadia, which is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. Dan unknowingly reported fraud to one of the perpetrators. |\n| **AD 3.4.2** - Third Respondent - RegimA Skin Treatments | RegimA Skin Treatments CC (B1992/005371/23) owes R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Kayla's estate) since February 2023. When Jax raised this debt on 15 May 2025, Rynette claimed it was paid\u2014a false statement. RegimA Skin Treatments receives stock from Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Rynette's son. |\n| **AD 3.6** - Fourth Respondent - Regim A UK | RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions show continuous Shopify payments. This contradicts claims that will appear later in the affidavit about UK entities owing money to SA operations. |\n| **AD 3.6.1** - Fifth Respondent - Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC | Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC (1996/004451/23) is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. Financial analysis shows an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group\u2014an excessive profit extraction. This was the fraud Dan reported to the accountant on 6 June 2025. |\n| **AD 3.6.2** - Windeed Printout Evidence for Villa Via Arcadia | Property registration confirms trust ownership. The trust has three trustees, but only two were known to the beneficiaries at the time of this application. |\n| **AD 3.7** - Sixth Respondent - Strategic Logistics CC | Strategic Logistics CC (2008/136496/23) experienced a R5.4 million stock adjustment in 2024\u2014stock that \"just disappeared.\" This represents 46% of annual sales (R5.4M on R11.3M sales) and is 10 times the prior year's adjustment. The stock type matches inventory supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments. |\n| **AD 3.7.2** - Windeed Printout Evidence for Strategic Logistics | Property registration documents. In a SARS audit email concerning the R5.4M stock adjustment, Rynette claimed that Danie Bantjies instructed her to make the huge payments related to this transaction. |\n| **AD 3.8** - Seventh Respondent - FirstRand Bank (FNB) | FNB holds accounts for the companies. On 14 and 15 February 2025, unauthorized transfers of R450,000 each (R900,000 total) were made from RegimA SA's FNB account without Dan's authority as co-director. The account opened with R997,597.94 and closed at R5,284.08 within one month, despite 169 customer deposits totaling R566,598.57 proving active trade. |\n| **AD 3.9** - Eighth and Ninth Respondents | ABSA Bank and CIPC are cited. Rynette may have opened 8 ABSA accounts using Dan's information without authorization. Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide began with an ABSA bank letter dated 14 April 2025. |\n| **AD 3.11** - Reference to Respondents as Wife and Son | Peter refers to Jax and Dan as \"my wife\" and \"my son.\" Both are beneficiaries of the Faucitt Family Trust. Jax is also a co-trustee. The Trust Property Control Act Section 9(1) requires trustees to act with care, diligence, and skill in the interests of beneficiaries. |\n| **AD 3.13** - Court Jurisdiction and Identity Confirmation | Jurisdiction confirmed. The affidavit is commissioned by Danie Bantjies, who signs as \"Commissioner of Oaths.\" Bantjies's accounting firm is \"Bantjes and Company.\" His full relationship to the trust and companies will emerge through the evidence. |\n---\n## Section 2: Accountant Details - Bantjies Conflict of Interest (AD 4)\n| AD Paragraph | Commentary |\n|:-------------|:-----------|\n| **AD 4** - Accountant Details - Bantjes and Company | Peter identifies \"our accountant\" as Danie Jacobus Bantjies of \"Bantjes and Company,\" who attended the office in mid-June 2025. What Peter does not disclose: (1) Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust\u2014a status unknown to beneficiaries Dan and Jax; (2) Bantjies is a debtor to the trust, owing R18.685 million on an investment payout schedule (May 2026, 2027, 2029); (3) Bantjies controls the financial systems and gave instructions to Rynette for multi-million rand transactions; (4) Bantjies was \"running the companies\" when Dan exposed Villa Via fraud on 6 June 2025; (5) Bantjies dismissed Dan's audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\" This creates an impermissible conflict: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant + Company Controller. Bantjies had a direct financial interest in preventing discovery of the fraud Dan reported. |\n---\n## Section 3: Corporate Structure (AD 6.1-6.5)\n| AD Paragraph | Commentary |\n|:-------------|:-----------|\n| **AD 6.1** - Relationships Between Parties | Peter describes family and corporate relationships. The evidence shows a different control structure: Rynette controlled all bank accounts (Peter had no access), controlled the Sage accounting system using Peter's email (pete@regima.com), and claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions rather than Peter's. Rynette's sister Linda was employed as bookkeeper, yet two years of expenses remained unallocated until 30 March 2025. |\n| **AD 6.3** - Directors and Members of Respondent Entities | Peter describes directorships. Key facts: Jax and Dan are co-directors of RegimA SA and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (RWD). RWD is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. On 30 March 2025, Rynette and Peter dumped two years of unallocated expenses into RWD and demanded Dan sign off within 12 hours for SARS VAT and Annual Accounts. Dan used this deadline extension (until 6 June) to finalize reports and uncover the Villa Via fraud. |\n| **AD 6.5** - Banking and Registration of Respondent Entities | Peter describes banking arrangements. The evidence shows: (1) Peter had no access to any bank accounts; (2) Rynette controlled all accounts; (3) Revenue diversion for RegimA SA started 1 March 2025; (4) Revenue diversion for RWD started 14 April 2025 (ABSA bank letter); (5) On 11 September 2025, R1.73 million was transferred from accounts\u2014six months after sabotage began, Dan was still managing to pay creditors. |\n---\n## Section 4: Urgency and Alleged Misconduct (AD 7-7.20)\n| AD Paragraph | Commentary |\n|:-------------|:-----------|\n| **AD 7** - Urgency and Delay Considerations | Peter claims urgency. The timeline reveals: (1) Alleged discovery mid-June 2025; (2) Application filed August 2025; (3) Two-month delay contradicts urgency. The actual urgency relates to Dan's fraud exposure on 6 June and Jax's debt inquiry on 15 May. |\n| **AD 7.3** - Urgency Details | Peter claims the accountant noted \"numerous discrepancies\" and \"irregular payments\" in mid-June 2025. Timeline analysis: 6 June 2025 (Dan provides comprehensive reports to Bantjies), 7 June 2025 (Peter cancels 15 UK business cards without notice). The card cancellation occurred one day after Dan's cooperation, not \"following\" any discovery. This is venire contra factum proprium\u2014Peter created the problem he now complains about. |\n| **AD 7.6** - Financial Impact of Misconduct | Peter alleges financial impact. The actual financial sabotage: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) Revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025; (3) Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025 (100% audit data loss, seven days after Jax's confrontation); (4) Card cancellation 7 June 2025; (5) Domain theft 29 May 2025 (regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory, 14 days after Jax's confrontation); (6) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 (R34.9M operations destroyed). |\n| **AD 7.8** - Continuing Harm to Corporations | Peter claims continuing harm. The harm was systematically inflicted: Email from Gee on 20 June 2025 states she was instructed to send \"don't use regima.zone only use regimaskin.co.za\" email. Regimaskin.co.za is owned by Adderory (Rynette's son's company), not by RegimA. This diverted customers from Dan's platforms to a competing domain controlled by Rynette's family. |\n| **AD 7.10** - Card Cancellations and Service Interruptions | Peter claims he cancelled cards in June 2025 \"following\" the accountant's discovery and requested invoices from Dan. Timeline evidence: (1) 6 June: Dan provides comprehensive reports; (2) 7 June: Peter cancels UK cards (5191, 5225) paying for Shopify subscriptions; (3) Cards cancelled one day after cooperation, not after any discovery. The cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible (card-based authentication), then Peter complained about missing documentation. |\n| **AD 7.13** - Domain and Service Halts Due to Card Cancellations | Peter claims subscriptions were halted due to card cancellations. To prevent business collapse, Dan substituted his personal card (1927) for RegimA SA and Jax her personal card (3212) for RegimA Zone. Meanwhile, the competing domain regimaskin.co.za was actively diverting customers. |\n| **AD 7.16** - Son's Interference with Business Operations | Peter alleges Dan interfered with operations. The evidence shows Dan built and managed 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. Dan's partner Kayla Pretorius co-built these operations before her murder on 13 July 2023. After Kayla's death, a court order was obtained to seize her email account (kayp@rzo.io), which interfered with a law enforcement investigation that had instructed a freeze on the account. |\n| **AD 7.18** - Email and Account Access Interference | Peter claims Dan restricted email access. The evidence shows: (1) Peter had no access to his own email (pete@regima.com)\u2014controlled by Rynette; (2) Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 show Rynette using Peter's email; (3) Rynette claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions, not Peter's; (4) Kayla's email was seized by court order after her murder. |\n| **AD 7.20** - Continued Interference Not in Corporate Interests | Peter claims interference is not in corporate interests. The corporate interests were served by Dan's profitable operations (R34.9M annually). The interference came from: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Domain theft; (6) Warehouse sabotage. Each action occurred after either Jax's debt inquiry (15 May) or Dan's fraud exposure (6 June). |\n---\n## Section 5: Financial Discrepancies and Misconduct (AD 8.4-9.3)\n| AD Paragraph | Commentary |\n|:-------------|:-----------|\n| **AD 8.4** - Discovery of Financial Discrepancies | Peter claims the accountant discovered discrepancies. The accountant is Danie Bantjies, who is also: (1) Undisclosed trustee; (2) Debtor owing R18.685M; (3) Controller of financial systems; (4) Recipient of Dan's fraud report on 6 June 2025. Bantjies dismissed Dan's audit request on 10 June 2025. The \"discovery\" occurred after Dan exposed fraud to the person running the fraud. |\n| **AD 8.5** - Accountant's Attendance and Findings | Peter states Bantjies attended for provisional tax and VAT submissions. The two years of unallocated expenses (dumped into RWD on 30 March 2025) occurred while: (1) Rynette controlled the accounting system using Peter's email; (2) Linda (Rynette's sister) was employed as bookkeeper; (3) Bantjies was the accountant. The question arises: why were expenses unallocated for two years if the accountant and bookkeeper were performing their duties? |\n| **AD 8.7** - IT Expenses and Tax Problems | Peter cites IT expenses: 2024 tax year R6,738,007.47; 2025 tax year R2,116,159.47. Peter claims these are \"almost entirely unexplainable.\" Context omitted from the affidavit: These expenses supported 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. The IT expenses represent 19.3% of revenue (2024) and 6.1% of revenue (2025)\u2014reasonable for a global e-commerce operation. Peter fails to disclose the revenue context. |\n| **AD 8.10** - International Expenses and Tax Implications | Peter claims expenses are \"seemingly international\" and accounts have \"almost exceeded the yearly allowable quota for funds leaving South Africa.\" The Shopify platforms were funded by UK company RegimA Zone Ltd (company 10697009). UK bank transactions show continuous Shopify payments. The international expenses were legitimate costs of UK-owned e-commerce operations. |\n| **AD 9.2** - Bank Message Regarding International Transfers | Peter references bank messages about international transfers. The actual international payment flow: UK entities (RegimA Zone Ltd) funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually, as evidenced by Shopify invoices. The payment direction is UK \u2192 SA, not SA \u2192 UK as Peter's affidavit implies. |\n| **AD 9.3** - Financial Misconduct Summary | Peter summarizes alleged misconduct. The documented financial misconduct: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) without Dan's authority; (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments; (3) Rynette claimed Bantjies instructed the huge payments for this stock (SARS audit email); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023, unpaid despite Rynette's false claim to Jax that it was paid. |\n---\n## Section 6: Application to Declare Respondents Delinquent (AD 10.1-10.14)\n| AD Paragraph | Commentary |\n|:-------------|:-----------|\n| **AD 10.1** - Relief Sought - Delinquency or Probation | Peter seeks delinquency or probation orders under Section 162. The evidence establishes grounds for Peter's own delinquency: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers in breach of fiduciary duty as co-director; (2) Card cancellation sabotage one day after Dan's cooperation; (3) False statements about UK payment flows (perjury); (4) Abuse of ex parte process through material non-disclosures. |\n| **AD 10.3** - Delinquent Conduct of Respondents | Peter alleges delinquent conduct by Jax and Dan. Jax's actual conduct: (1) Fulfilled fiduciary duty as trustee by investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025); (2) Confronted Rynette about profiting from proceeds of murder; (3) Deceived by co-trustees into signing \"Main Trustee\" document (11 Aug 2025); (4) Punished with interdict two days later (13 Aug 2025). Dan's actual conduct: (1) Built R34.9M profitable operations; (2) Reported Villa Via fraud to accountant (6 June 2025); (3) Cooperated by providing comprehensive reports; (4) Substituted personal card to prevent business collapse after Peter's sabotage. |\n| **AD 10.4** - Contravention of Companies Act | Peter alleges Companies Act contraventions. Section 76(3)(b) requires directors to act in good faith and for a proper purpose. Peter's actions demonstrate bad faith: (1) Manufactured crisis (card cancellation day after cooperation); (2) Material non-disclosures in ex parte application; (3) False statements about UK operations; (4) Systematic sabotage of profitable businesses. |\n| **AD 10.5.2** - Probation Relief Under Section 162 | Peter seeks probation under Section 162. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence reveals: Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) commissioned this affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths. Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery of the fraud Dan reported. |\n| **AD 10.6** - Close Corporations Act - Fiduciary Duties | Peter invokes Close Corporations Act fiduciary duties. The Act requires members to manage in the corporation's interest. RegimA Skin Treatments (CC) owes R1,035,000 to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023. Strategic Logistics (CC) lost R5.4M in stock that \"disappeared\"\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory. These transactions were not in the corporations' interests. |\n| **AD 10.6.1** - Member's Duty to Manage in Corporation's Interest | Peter cites duty to manage in corporation's interest. The R5.4M stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics represents 46% of annual sales\u201410 times the historical adjustment. Rynette claimed Bantjies instructed the payments. This transaction was not in Strategic Logistics' interest. |\n| **AD 10.6.2** - Member's Duty Not to Exceed Powers | Peter cites duty not to exceed powers. The unauthorized R900,000 transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) were made without Dan's authority as co-director. Peter exceeded his powers by acting unilaterally. |\n| **AD 10.6.3** - Member's Duty to Avoid Conflicts of Interest | Peter cites duty to avoid conflicts. The evidence reveals multiple conflicts: (1) Bantjies: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant; (2) Rynette's son (Adderory) supplying stock to RegimA Skin Treatments while same stock type \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) Villa Via (trust-owned) charging 86% profit margin rent to group; (4) Regimaskin.co.za (owned by Rynette's son) competing with RegimA operations. |\n| **AD 10.7** - Member Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty | Peter invokes breach of fiduciary duty liability. The breaches are established: (1) Peter breached fiduciary duty to Dan (co-director) by unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) Peter breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries (as trustee) by attacking them with interdict; (3) Bantjies breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries by dismissing audit request and facilitating fraud. |\n| **AD 10.7.1.2** - Liability for Economic Benefit Derived | Peter cites liability for economic benefit. The economic benefits derived: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (4) 86% profit margin on Villa Via rent; (5) Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za (Adderory). |\n| **AD 10.7.1.4** - Liability for Loss Suffered by Corporation | Peter cites liability for corporate loss. The losses suffered: (1) RegimA SA: R900K unauthorized transfers, revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025, Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025; (2) RegimA Zone: Customer diversion to competing domain, card cancellation sabotage; (3) Strategic Logistics: R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (4) RegimA Worldwide: Forced to pay 2 years of unallocated expenses from all companies. |\n| **AD 10.8** - Disqualification for Misconduct Under Section 47 | Peter invokes Close Corporations Act Section 47 disqualification. This section applies when a member is guilty of gross negligence or fraud. The R5.4M stock adjustment (46% of sales, 10x historical) in Strategic Logistics, with Rynette claiming Bantjies instructed the payments, and the same stock type supplied by Adderory, suggests systematic fraud. |\n| **AD 10.8.1** - Declaration of Delinquency as Alternative Relief | Peter seeks delinquency declaration. The evidence supports declaring Peter delinquent under Section 162(5): (1) Intentional harm to companies (systematic sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent conduct (card cancellation without notice); (3) Breach of trust (attacking beneficiaries as trustee); (4) Abuse of process (ex parte order based on material non-disclosures and false statements). |\n| **AD 10.9** - Mandatory Disqualification Under Section 162(5) | Peter invokes Section 162(5) mandatory disqualification grounds. These grounds apply to Peter's conduct: (1) Intentional harm to companies (R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent harm (card cancellation rendering documentation inaccessible); (3) Breach of trust (trustee attacking beneficiaries). |\n| **AD 10.9.2** - Intentional or Grossly Negligent Harm | Peter alleges intentional or grossly negligent harm by respondents. The intentional harm was inflicted by Peter and his co-conspirators: (1) 6 June: Dan cooperates; (2) 7 June: Cards cancelled; (3) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days after Jax's inquiry); (4) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days after Jax's inquiry); (5) 8 July: Warehouse sabotaged; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action followed either Jax's debt inquiry or Dan's fraud exposure. |\n| **AD 10.9.3** - Manner of Acting - Gross Negligence or Misconduct | Peter alleges gross negligence or misconduct. The gross negligence: Cancelling 15 business cards without notice, rendering documentation inaccessible, then complaining about missing documentation. This demonstrates consciousness of guilt and bad faith. |\n| **AD 10.9.3.1** - Gross Negligence or Wilful Misconduct | Peter alleges wilful misconduct. The wilful misconduct: (1) Systematic revenue diversion (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (2) Data destruction (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Card sabotage (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). This six-month campaign occurred after Jax investigated fraud and Dan exposed fraud. |\n| **AD 10.9.3.2** - Acquiescence to Fraudulent Acts | Peter alleges acquiescence to fraud. The acquiescence to fraud: (1) Two years of unallocated expenses while Rynette controlled systems using Peter's email and Linda was employed as bookkeeper; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" with Bantjies allegedly instructing payments; (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate unpaid since Feb 2023; (4) Villa Via 86% profit margin rent extraction. |\n| **AD 10.9.3.3** - Party to Omission with Fraudulent Purpose | Peter alleges omission with fraudulent purpose. The omissions with fraudulent purpose: (1) Peter omitted Bantjies's trustee status from affidavit; (2) Peter omitted Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Peter omitted R34.9M revenue context for IT expenses; (4) Peter omitted UK \u2192 SA payment flow (claimed opposite); (5) Peter omitted timeline showing card cancellation day after Dan's cooperation; (6) Peter omitted Jax's debt inquiry and subsequent retaliation. |\n| **AD 10.10** - Probation Under Section 162(7) | Peter seeks probation under Section 162(7). This section applies when conduct is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial. The oppressive conduct: (1) Jax fulfilled fiduciary duty by investigating debt, then was punished with interdict; (2) Dan exposed fraud to accountant, then suffered six-month sabotage campaign; (3) Both excluded from profitable businesses they built. |\n| **AD 10.10.2.3** - Oppressive or Prejudicial Exercise of Powers | Peter alleges oppressive exercise of powers. The oppressive exercise of powers: (1) Peter used trustee powers to attack beneficiaries; (2) Bantjies used trustee powers to dismiss audit request and facilitate fraud; (3) Peter used director powers to make unauthorized R900K transfers; (4) Peter used court process to obtain ex parte order based on material non-disclosures. |\n| **AD 10.10.2.4** - Conduct with Oppressive or Prejudicial Result | Peter alleges conduct with prejudicial result. The prejudicial results: (1) Jax excluded from companies after investigating fraud; (2) Dan excluded from R34.9M operations he built; (3) Customers diverted to competing domain owned by Rynette's son; (4) R900K transferred without authorization; (5) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (6) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate unpaid. |\n| **AD 10.10.22** - Business Conducted in Oppressive Manner | Peter alleges oppressive business conduct. The oppressive conduct: (1) Rynette controlled all systems using Peter's email while claiming to act under Bantjies's instructions; (2) Peter had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems; (3) Two years of expenses unallocated despite employed bookkeeper; (4) Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) dismissed fraud investigation. |\n| **AD 10.10.41** - Conduct Inconsistent with Duties | Peter alleges conduct inconsistent with duties. The conduct inconsistent with duties: (1) Trustee attacking beneficiaries (Peter, Bantjies); (2) Director making unauthorized transfers (Peter); (3) Trustee dismissing fraud investigation (Bantjies); (4) Accountant facilitating fraud while being debtor (Bantjies); (5) Administrator controlling systems while diverting revenue (Rynette). |\n| **AD 10.13** - Unaccounted Money - Significant Sums | Peter alleges unaccounted money. The unaccounted money: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023; (4) R1.73 million transferred 11 Sep 2025; (5) Two years of unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide on 30 Mar 2025. |\n| **AD 10.14** - Full Extent of Transgressions Not Yet Determined | Peter claims full extent not yet determined. The full extent includes: (1) Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status; (2) Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Rynette's control of Peter's email; (4) Rynette's son's competing domain; (5) Adderory's stock supply relationship; (6) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme; (7) Court order seizing Kayla's email during law enforcement investigation; (8) Possible 8 ABSA accounts opened using Dan's information. |\n---\n## Section 7: UK Operations and Alleged Fraud (AD 11.2-12.4)\n| AD Paragraph | Commentary |\n|:-------------|:-----------|\n| **AD 11.2** - UK Head Office - RegimA UK Ltd | Peter describes UK operations. RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions show continuous Shopify payments. The UK company is the economic owner of the e-commerce operations. |\n| **AD 11.3** - Directors of UK Entity | Peter describes UK directors. The UK company was established by Dan and Kayla to own and operate the global e-commerce platforms. After Kayla's murder (13 July 2023), Dan continued managing the operations. |\n| **AD 11.4** - Applicant's Role in Operations | Peter describes his role. The evidence shows Peter had no operational role: (1) No access to email (controlled by Rynette); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Rynette); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Rynette); (4) Rynette claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions, not Peter's. Peter appears to be a figurehead. |\n| **AD 11.6** - UK Branch Operations | Peter describes UK branch operations. The UK company funded SA operations through Shopify subscription payments. Shopify invoices show UK \u2192 SA payment flow of R84,661+ annually. The UK company invested in SA operations, not the reverse. |\n| **AD 11.8** - UK Financial Concerns | Peter expresses UK financial concerns. The financial concerns were manufactured: (1) Card cancellation 7 June 2025 disrupted UK funding; (2) Domain theft 29 May 2025 diverted customers; (3) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 destroyed UK-funded operations; (4) Data expungement 22 May 2025 eliminated audit trail. |\n| **AD 12.1** - UK Branch Non-Payment and Fraud Concerns | Peter alleges UK branch non-payment and fraud. The Shopify invoices (DF5-DF7) prove the opposite: UK entities funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually. UK bank transactions corroborate the invoices. Peter's statement is demonstrably false\u2014perjury. |\n| **AD 12.2** - Misappropriation Leading to Insolvency Risk | Peter alleges misappropriation leading to insolvency. The actual insolvency risk was created by: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (3) Data expungement (22 May); (4) Card cancellation (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). Despite six months of sabotage, Dan was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied. |\n| **AD 12.3** - Purpose of Court Application | Peter states the purpose is to prevent further harm. The actual purpose: (1) Punish Jax for investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May); (2) Punish Dan for exposing Villa Via fraud (6 June); (3) Seize control of R34.9M operations Dan built; (4) Prevent forensic audit that would expose Bantjies's conflicts and the systematic fraud. |\n| **AD 12.4** - Alternative Roles for Wife and Son | Peter suggests alternative roles for Jax and Dan. The evidence shows: (1) Jax fulfilled trustee duties by investigating fraud; (2) Dan built and managed R34.9M profitable operations; (3) Both were systematically sabotaged after investigating/exposing fraud; (4) Both were attacked with interdict by co-trustees Peter and Bantjies; (5) Jax was included in interdict two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document. |\n---\n## Section 8: Requirements for Interdictory Relief (AD 13.2-13.8)\n| AD Paragraph | Commentary |\n|:-------------|:-----------|\n| **AD 13.2** - Clear Right Not to Be Prejudiced | Peter claims clear right not to be prejudiced. Peter has no clear right: (1) He manufactured the crisis (card cancellation day after Dan's cooperation); (2) He made unauthorized R900K transfers; (3) He had alternative remedies as trustee with \"additional powers\"; (4) He obtained order through material non-disclosures (Bantjies's trustee status, debtor status, timeline manipulation, UK payment flow perjury). |\n| **AD 13.2.2** - Injury Sustained and Apprehension of Further Harm | Peter claims injury and apprehension of harm. Peter suffered no injury he didn't inflict on himself: (1) Card cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible; (2) Unauthorized transfers depleted accounts; (3) Revenue diversions reduced cash flow; (4) Warehouse sabotage destroyed operations. The apprehension of further harm was manufactured to justify ex parte relief. |\n| **AD 13.3** - Reasonable Apprehension of Irreparable Harm | Peter claims reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm. The irreparable harm was inflicted by Peter's six-month sabotage campaign: (1) R34.9M operations destroyed (93.3% revenue collapse); (2) Customer relationships diverted to competing domain; (3) Audit data expunged (100% loss); (4) Documentation rendered inaccessible; (5) Accounts emptied. Dan and Jax suffered irreparable harm, not Peter. |\n| **AD 13.4** - Interdicts Essential for Corporation Survival | Peter claims interdicts essential for survival. The corporations were profitable under Dan's management (R34.9M annually). The survival threat came from Peter's sabotage: (1) Unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data destruction; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Excluding Dan and Jax threatened survival, not ensured it. |\n| **AD 13.5** - Balance of Convenience Favours Granting Relief | Peter claims balance of convenience favors relief. The balance overwhelmingly favors Dan and Jax: (1) They built and managed profitable operations; (2) They investigated and exposed fraud; (3) They were systematically sabotaged for doing so; (4) They substituted personal cards to prevent business collapse; (5) They support independent forensic audit. Peter obtained relief through material non-disclosures and false statements. |\n| **AD 13.8** - Other Relief Sought in Part A | Peter seeks additional relief. The relief was obtained ex parte based on: (1) Omitting Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Omitting Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Omitting timeline showing card cancellation day after cooperation; (4) Falsely claiming UK owes SA (opposite is true); (5) Omitting R34.9M revenue context; (6) Omitting Jax's debt inquiry and retaliation pattern. |\n---\n## Section 9: Financial Constraints and Forensic Audit (AD 14.1-14.5)\n| AD Paragraph | Commentary |\n|:-------------|:-----------|\n| **AD 14.1** - Financial Constraints on Respondents | Peter seeks financial constraints on Jax and Dan. The financial constraints were already imposed through sabotage: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Despite six months of sabotage, Dan was still managing to pay creditors. |\n| **AD 14.3** - Constraint to Prevent Financial Prejudice | Peter seeks constraints to prevent prejudice. The prejudice was inflicted by Peter: (1) RegimA SA account opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 (Feb-Mar 2025); (2) 169 customer deposits R566,598.57 proving active trade; (3) R1.73M transferred 11 Sep 2025; (4) R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage. |\n| **AD 14.4** - Forensic Audit Necessity and Remuneration | Peter seeks forensic audit. Dan and Jax support independent forensic audit by impartial party. Such audit would reveal: (1) Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant); (2) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme (SLG \u2192 Adderory \u2192 RST); (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (4) Two years unallocated expenses; (5) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (6) Revenue diversion scheme; (7) Rynette's control of systems using Peter's email. |\n| **AD 14.5** - Request for Relief Under Part B | Peter requests Part B relief. The relief should include: (1) Setting aside ex parte order obtained through material non-disclosures; (2) Independent forensic audit; (3) Investigation of Bantjies's conflicts; (4) Investigation of R5.4M stock \"disappearance\"; (5) Recovery of R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (6) Investigation of Rynette's control and Adderory's role; (7) Consideration of Peter's delinquency under Section 162(5). |\n---\n## Section 10: Discovery and Urgency (AD 16.1-16.12)\n| AD Paragraph | Commentary |\n|:-------------|:-----------|\n| **AD 16.1** - Discovery of Respondents' Conduct | Peter claims discovery of conduct in mid-June 2025. The actual discovery: (1) 15 May: Jax discovered R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (2) 6 June: Dan exposed Villa Via fraud to Bantjies; (3) 7 June: Peter cancelled cards (day after Dan's cooperation); (4) 10 June: Bantjies dismissed audit request. Peter's \"discovery\" was actually consciousness of guilt after Dan exposed fraud to Bantjies. |\n| **AD 16.2** - R600,000 Transfer as Trigger for Action | Peter cites R600,000 transfer (later corrected to R500,000) as trigger. The actual triggers: (1) 15 May: Jax confronted Rynette about R1,035,000 debt and \"profiting from proceeds of murder\"; (2) 6 June: Dan exposed Villa Via fraud to Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) 10 June: Bantjies dismissed audit request. The R500,000 transfer is a pretext. |\n| **AD 16.5** - Unawareness of Urgent Application Process | Peter claims unawareness of urgent process. Peter had access to legal advice and Bantjies as Commissioner of Oaths. The delay from mid-June to August contradicts urgency. The actual urgency: preventing forensic audit that would expose Bantjies's conflicts and systematic fraud. |\n| **AD 16.6** - Delay Would Have Been Avoided | Peter claims delay would have been avoided if he knew the process. The two-month delay (mid-June to August) contradicts urgency. The timing suggests: (1) Waiting to see if Dan's audit request would proceed; (2) Coordinating with Bantjies (who dismissed audit request 10 June); (3) Preparing Jax's punishment (included in interdict 13 Aug, two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document 11 Aug). |\n| **AD 16.8** - State of Shock and Delayed Response | Peter claims state of shock. Peter was not in shock\u2014he was executing a systematic sabotage campaign: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping; (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 7 Jun: Card cancellation; (6) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (7) 11 Sep: Account emptying. This is not shock\u2014this is systematic execution. |\n| **AD 16.10** - Attorney Consultation Timeline | Peter describes attorney consultation. The consultation occurred after: (1) Jax's debt inquiry (15 May); (2) Data expungement (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Dan's fraud exposure (6 June); (5) Card cancellation (7 June); (6) Bantjies's audit dismissal (10 June). The legal action was retaliation, not discovery. |\n| **AD 16.12** - Need for Urgent Court Assistance | Peter claims need for urgent assistance. Peter had alternative remedies: (1) Trustee with \"additional powers\" as Founder; (2) Could have conducted audit as trustee; (3) Could have consulted with co-trustee Jax (instead, he attacked her); (4) Could have consulted with co-trustee Bantjies (who was facilitating the fraud). Peter chose ex parte process to avoid disclosure of Bantjies's conflicts and systematic sabotage. |\n---\n## Section 11: Ex Parte Basis (AD 17.3-17.4)\n| AD Paragraph | Commentary |\n|:-------------|:-----------|\n| **AD 17.3** - Ex Parte Basis for Application | Peter justifies ex parte application. The ex parte process was abused through material non-disclosures: (1) Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Timeline manipulation (card cancellation day after cooperation); (4) UK payment flow perjury (claimed SA \u2192 UK, actually UK \u2192 SA); (5) R34.9M revenue context omission; (6) Jax's debt inquiry and retaliation pattern; (7) Dan's fraud exposure and retaliation pattern; (8) Rynette's control of Peter's email; (9) Adderory's competing domain; (10) R5.4M stock \"disappearance.\" |\n| **AD 17.4** - Urgency Justifies Ex Parte Relief | Peter claims urgency justifies ex parte relief. The urgency was manufactured: (1) Two-month delay contradicts urgency; (2) Card cancellation day after cooperation shows consciousness of guilt; (3) Systematic sabotage from Feb-Sep shows premeditation; (4) Jax included two days after signing document shows coordination; (5) Alternative remedies available as trustee. The ex parte relief was obtained to prevent Dan and Jax from exposing the material non-disclosures and systematic fraud. |\n---\n## Section 12: Remaining Paragraphs (AD 18.3, 20, 22, 40.9.4, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, 88)\n| AD Paragraph | Commentary |\n|:-------------|:-----------|\n| **AD 18.3** - Continual Unauthorized Fund Transfers | Peter alleges continual unauthorized transfers. The unauthorized transfers were made by Peter: R450,000 on 14 Feb 2025 + R450,000 on 15 Feb 2025 = R900,000 total from RegimA SA without Dan's authority as co-director. RegimA SA account: opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 within one month despite 169 customer deposits R566,598.57. |\n| **AD 20** - First and Second Respondent Details | Peter provides Jax and Dan's details. The details omitted: (1) Jax confronted Rynette about R1,035,000 debt on 15 May 2025; (2) Jax was deceived into signing \"Main Trustee\" document on 11 Aug 2025; (3) Jax was included in interdict on 13 Aug 2025 (two days later); (4) Dan exposed Villa Via fraud on 6 June 2025; (5) Dan suffered six-month sabotage campaign; (6) Dan built R34.9M profitable operations with murdered partner Kayla. |\n| **AD 22** - Additional Party Information | Peter provides additional information. The information omitted: (1) Faucitt Family Trust has three trustees: Peter, Jax, Bantjies; (2) Bantjies's trustee status was unknown to beneficiaries; (3) Bantjies is debtor owing R18.685M; (4) Bantjies is accountant controlling financial systems; (5) Bantjies dismissed Dan's audit request; (6) Bantjies commissioned this affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths. |\n| **AD 40.9.4** - Gross Abuse of Director/Member Position | Peter alleges gross abuse of position. The gross abuse: (1) Peter made R900K unauthorized transfers as director; (2) Peter cancelled cards without notice as director; (3) Peter used trustee position to attack beneficiaries; (4) Bantjies used trustee position to dismiss audit and facilitate fraud; (5) Rynette used administrative position to control systems, divert revenue, and facilitate son's competing domain. |\n| **AD 44** - Applicant Identity Details | Peter confirms identity. Peter's actual position: (1) No access to email (pete@regima.com controlled by Rynette); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Rynette); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Rynette); (4) Debtor to Bantjies (R18.685M due May 2026); (5) Figurehead while Rynette claims to act under Bantjies's instructions. |\n| **AD 50** - Registered Address Details | Peter provides address: 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview. This is also Jax's address. Peter attacked his wife (co-trustee, beneficiary) with interdict two days after she signed \"Main Trustee\" document, punishing her for investigating R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate and supporting Dan. |\n| **AD 74** - Timeline Context | Peter provides timeline context. The actual timeline: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping (12-hour deadline); (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 15 May: Jax's debt inquiry; (6) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days later); (7) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days later); (8) 6 Jun: Dan's fraud exposure; (9) 7 Jun: Cards cancelled (1 day later); (10) 10 Jun: Audit dismissed; (11) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotaged; (12) 11 Aug: Jax signs document; (13) 13 Aug: Jax included in interdict (2 days later); (14) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. |\n| **AD 78** - Accountant's Office Visit and Discovery | Peter describes Bantjies's office visit. The visit occurred after: (1) Dan provided comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025; (2) Dan exposed Villa Via fraud to Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) Peter cancelled cards on 7 June 2025 (day after Dan's cooperation). Bantjies \"discovered\" irregularities after Dan reported fraud to him. Bantjies then dismissed audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\" |\n| **AD 83** - Irregular Payments Discovery | Peter describes discovery of irregular payments. The irregular payments: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers by Peter (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics (same type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) Rynette claimed Bantjies instructed the huge payments (SARS audit email); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023 (Rynette falsely claimed paid to Jax on 15 May 2025). |\n| **AD 88** - Follow-up Actions | Peter describes follow-up actions. The follow-up actions: (1) 7 Jun: Card cancellation (day after Dan's cooperation); (2) 10 Jun: Bantjies dismisses audit; (3) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (4) 11 Aug: Jax deceived into signing document; (5) 13 Aug: Jax included in interdict; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action was retaliation against Jax (15 May debt inquiry) and Dan (6 Jun fraud exposure). |\n---\n## Narrative Summary\nThe AD paragraphs, when examined with the evidence, reveal a progressive pattern:\n**Initial Layer:** Peter presents himself as a concerned director discovering financial irregularities through his accountant, Danie Bantjies.\n**Second Layer:** The evidence shows Peter had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems\u2014all controlled by Rynette Farrar, who claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions, not Peter's.\n**Third Layer:** Bantjies is revealed to be an undisclosed trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, unknown to beneficiaries Dan and Jax. Bantjies is also a debtor owing R18.685 million to the trust.\n**Fourth Layer:** The timeline shows Dan exposed Villa Via fraud to Bantjies on 6 June 2025, and Peter cancelled business cards on 7 June 2025\u2014one day later. Jax confronted Rynette about R1,035,000 debt on 15 May 2025, and data was expunged 7 days later, with a competing domain registered 14 days later.\n**Fifth Layer:** The competing domain (regimaskin.co.za) is owned by Adderory, a company owned by Rynette's son. Adderory supplies stock to RegimA Skin Treatments\u2014the same stock type that \"disappeared\" (R5.4M) from Strategic Logistics. Rynette claimed Bantjies instructed the payments.\n**Sixth Layer:** The R1,035,000 debt is owed to Rezonance, part of Kayla Pretorius's estate. Kayla was Dan's partner and co-builder of the R34.9M Shopify operations. Kayla was murdered on 13 July 2023. A court order was obtained to seize her email account, interfering with a law enforcement investigation.\n**Seventh Layer:** Jax was deceived into signing a \"Main Trustee\" document on 11 August 2025, backdating Peter's designation to 1 July 2025. Two days later, on 13 August 2025, Peter and Bantjies (co-trustees) included Jax in the interdict\u2014punishment for investigating the debt and supporting Dan.\n**Final Layer:** The systematic sabotage campaign (Feb-Sep 2025) destroyed R34.9M operations that Dan built. Despite six months of sabotage, Dan was still managing to pay creditors until accounts were emptied on 11 September 2025. The ex parte order was obtained through material non-disclosures to prevent forensic audit that would expose Bantjies's conflicts and the systematic fraud.\n**The Web Revealed:** Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant + Commissioner of Oaths) had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery. Rynette (Administrator controlling all systems) claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions. Rynette's son (Adderory) benefited from stock transfer pricing and domain theft. Peter (Figurehead with no access) attacked beneficiaries after they investigated fraud. The court process was abused to prevent exposure of this tangled web of conflicts, self-dealing, and systematic fraud.\n---\n**Commentary Completed:** November 1, 2025  \n**Repository:** cogpy/canima  \n**Purpose:** Progressive evidence revelation through AD paragraph sequence",

manufactured crisis\n- Section 76(3)(b) of Companies Act - bad faith and improper purpose\n- Section 162(5) of Companies Act - grounds for Peter's delinquency\n- Section 9(1) of Trust Property Control Act - trustee duties\n- Requirements for interdictory relief (clear right, harm, balance of convenience)\n### Strategic Recommendations\n- Emphasize manufactured crisis argument\n- Highlight retaliation pattern\n- Leverage Shopify invoice evidence for perjury\n- Support independent forensic audit\n- Pursue counter-application for Peter's delinquency\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nSent: Saturday, 01 November 2025 14:30\nTo: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.com>; Daniel Faucitt <d@rzo.io>; regizone <regizone@proton.me>\nSubject: AD NOTES - JACQUELINE FAUCITT\n## ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT: JACQUELINE FAUCITT\n**IN THE HIGH COURT OF SOUTH AFRICA**  \n**GAUTENG DIVISION, PRETORIA**\n**Case No:** 2025-137857\n**In the matter between:**\n**PETER ANDREW FAUCITT** \u2014 Applicant\nand\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT** \u2014 First Respondent  \n**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT** \u2014 Second Respondent  \n*(and others)*\n---\n## I, THE UNDERSIGNED\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**\ndo hereby make oath and state that:\n---\n### 1. INTRODUCTION AND CAPACITY\n1.1 I am the First Respondent in this matter, an adult female, and a South African citizen residing at 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview.\n1.2 I am a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust (IT 3651/2013) and a Beneficiary of the same trust. I am also a co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (2017/087935/07) and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (2011/005722/07), both of which are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust.\n1.3 The facts deposed to in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and belief, save where the context indicates otherwise, and are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\n1.4 Where I make legal submissions, I do so on the advice of my legal representatives.\n---\n### 2. PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT\n2.1 This affidavit is filed in response to the Applicant's founding affidavit and the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025.\n2.2 I oppose the relief sought by the Applicant and seek to have the ex parte order set aside on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n2.3 I address each of the Applicant's allegations in the order they appear in the founding affidavit, following the AD paragraph sequence.\n---\n### 3. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 1-3.13: PARTIES AND STRUCTURE\n#### AD 1 - Director Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n3.1 The Applicant invokes provisions relating to director liability for breach of fiduciary duty. I note that the accounting system used to track the alleged breaches was controlled by Rynette Farrar using the Applicant's email address (pete@regima.com), as evidenced by Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 (Annexure **SF2**). The Applicant himself had no access to this system.\n#### AD 1.3 - Applicant's Personal Details and Declaration\n3.2 The Applicant's personal details are noted. I observe that this affidavit was commissioned by Danie Jacobus Bantjies, identified as \"our accountant.\" The full extent of Mr. Bantjies's roles will become apparent through the evidence presented herein.\n#### AD 2 - Company Business Conduct Requirements\n3.3 The Applicant alleges reckless or grossly negligent business conduct. The financial performance of the companies demonstrates the contrary. The Second Respondent and his late partner, Kayla Pretorius, built 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. RegimA SA operates 25 stores with R8.5 million turnover, while RegimA Zone operates 26 stores with R26.4 million turnover. The businesses were highly profitable under the Second Respondent's management.\n#### AD 2.4 - Parties to the Application - Introduction\n3.4 The Applicant introduces the parties. The corporate structure reveals that certain entities are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust, which has three trustees. Two are identified in the founding affidavit: the Applicant and myself. The third trustee's identity was not disclosed to the beneficiaries until recently.\n#### AD 3 - Court Order for Probation of Directors/Members\n3.5 The Applicant seeks probation orders under Section 162 of the Companies Act. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence will demonstrate that the accountant who allegedly \"discovered\" the irregularities has multiple undisclosed roles that create impermissible conflicts.\n#### AD 3.2 - Respondents - Wife\n3.6 I am correctly identified as the Applicant's wife and First Respondent. On 15 May 2025, I confronted Rynette Farrar regarding a debt of R1,035,000 owed by RegimA Skin Treatments CC to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd since February 2023 (Annexure **JF2**). These funds were part of Kayla Pretorius's estate. I informed Ms. Farrar that keeping these funds would constitute profiting from the proceeds of murder. This confrontation proved significant in the events that followed.\n#### AD 3.4 - Respondents - Son\n3.7 The Second Respondent is correctly identified as the Applicant's son. On 6 June 2025, the Second Respondent cooperated with the Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports to the accountant regarding Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC, which is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust (Annexure **DF3**). The Second Respondent unknowingly reported fraud to one of the perpetrators.\n#### AD 3.4.2 - Third Respondent - RegimA Skin Treatments\n3.8 RegimA Skin Treatments CC (B1992/005371/23) owes R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, part of Kayla Pretorius's estate, since February 2023. When I raised this debt on 15 May 2025, Ms. Farrar claimed it was paid\u2014a statement I have since determined to be false. RegimA Skin Treatments receives stock from Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure **SF5**).\n#### AD 3.6 - Fourth Respondent - Regim A UK\n3.9 RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). This contradicts claims made later in the founding affidavit regarding UK entities owing money to SA operations.\n#### AD 3.6.1 - Fifth Respondent - Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC\n3.10 Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC (1996/004451/23) is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. Financial analysis reveals an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group\u2014an excessive profit extraction (Annexure **DF2**). This was the fraud the Second Respondent reported to the accountant on 6 June 2025.\n#### AD 3.6.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Villa Via Arcadia\n3.11 Property registration confirms trust ownership. The trust has three trustees, but only two were known to the beneficiaries at the time of this application.\n#### AD 3.7 - Sixth Respondent - Strategic Logistics CC\n3.12 Strategic Logistics CC (2008/136496/23) experienced a R5.4 million stock adjustment in 2024\u2014stock that allegedly \"just disappeared\" (Annexure **SF3**). This represents 46% of annual sales (R5.4M on R11.3M sales) and is 10 times the prior year's adjustment. The stock type matches inventory supplied by Adderory (Pty) Ltd to RegimA Skin Treatments.\n#### AD 3.7.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Strategic Logistics\n3.13 Property registration documents are noted. In a SARS audit email concerning the R5.4M stock adjustment, Ms. Farrar claimed that Danie Bantjies instructed her to make the substantial payments related to this transaction (Annexure **SF4**).\n#### AD 3.8 - Seventh Respondent - FirstRand Bank (FNB)\n3.14 FNB holds accounts for the companies. On 14 and 15 February 2025, unauthorized transfers of R450,000 each (R900,000 total) were made from RegimA SA's FNB account without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director (Annexure **DF9**). The account opened with R997,597.94 and closed at R5,284.08 within one month, despite 169 customer deposits totaling R566,598.57 proving active trade (Annexure **DF10**, **DF11**).\n#### AD 3.9 - Eighth and Ninth Respondents\n3.15 ABSA Bank and CIPC are cited. Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution began with an ABSA bank letter dated 14 April 2025 (Annexure **DF12**).\n#### AD 3.11 - Reference to Respondents as Wife and Son\n3.16 The Applicant refers to the Second Respondent and me as \"my wife\" and \"my son.\" Both of us are beneficiaries of the Faucitt Family Trust. I am also a co-trustee. The Trust Property Control Act, 57 of 1988, Section 9(1) requires trustees to act with care, diligence, and skill in the interests of beneficiaries.\n#### AD 3.13 - Court Jurisdiction and Identity Confirmation\n3.17 Jurisdiction is confirmed. The affidavit was commissioned by Danie Bantjies, who signed as \"Commissioner of Oaths.\" Mr. Bantjies's accounting firm is \"Bantjes and Company.\" His full relationship to the trust and companies will be revealed through the evidence presented herein.\n---\n### 4. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTANT DETAILS - BANTJIES CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n#### AD 4 - Accountant Details - Bantjes and Company\n4.1 The Applicant identifies \"our accountant\" as Danie Jacobus Bantjies of \"Bantjes and Company,\" who attended the office in mid-June 2025. What the Applicant does not disclose are the following material facts:\n4.1.1 Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust\u2014a status that was unknown to the beneficiaries, the Second Respondent and myself, until recently.\n4.1.2 Mr. Bantjies is a debtor to the trust, owing R18.685 million on an investment payout schedule with payments due in May 2026, May 2027, and May 2029 (Annexure **SF1**).\n4.1.3 Mr. Bantjies controls the financial systems and gave instructions to Ms. Farrar for multi-million rand transactions, as evidenced by emails (Annexure **SF4**).\n4.1.4 Mr. Bantjies was \"running the companies\" when the Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud on 6 June 2025.\n4.1.5 Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\"\n4.2 This creates an impermissible conflict of interest: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant + Company Controller. Mr. Bantjies had a direct financial interest in preventing discovery of the fraud the Second Respondent reported.\n---\n### 5. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1-6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE\n#### AD 6.1 - Relationships Between Parties\n5.1 The Applicant describes family and corporate relationships. The evidence demonstrates a different control structure. Ms. Farrar controlled all bank accounts (the Applicant had no access), controlled the Sage accounting system using the Applicant's email (pete@regima.com), and claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions rather than the Applicant's (Annexure **SF2**). Ms. Farrar's sister, Linda, was employed as bookkeeper, yet two years of expenses remained unallocated until 30 March 2025 (Annexure **SF8**).\n#### AD 6.3 - Directors and Members of Respondent Entities\n5.2 The Applicant describes directorships. The Second Respondent and I are co-directors of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd. RegimA Worldwide Distribution is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. On 30 March 2025, Ms. Farrar and the Applicant dumped two years of unallocated expenses into RegimA Worldwide Distribution and demanded the Second Respondent sign off within 12 hours for SARS VAT and Annual Accounts (Annexure **DF14**). The Second Respondent used this deadline extension (until 6 June) to finalize reports and uncover the Villa Via fraud.\n#### AD 6.5 - Banking and Registration of Respondent Entities\n5.3 The Applicant describes banking arrangements. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to any bank accounts; (2) Ms. Farrar controlled all accounts; (3) Revenue diversion for RegimA SA started 1 March 2025; (4) Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution started 14 April 2025 (ABSA bank letter); (5) On 11 September 2025, R1.73 million was transferred from accounts (Annexure **DF12**).\n---\n### 6. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7-7.20: URGENCY AND ALLEGED MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 7 - Urgency and Delay Considerations\n6.1 The Applicant claims urgency. The timeline reveals: (1) Alleged discovery mid-June 2025; (2) Application filed August 2025; (3) Two-month delay contradicts urgency. The actual urgency relates to the Second Respondent's fraud exposure on 6 June and my debt inquiry on 15 May.\n#### AD 7.3 - Urgency Details\n6.2 The Applicant claims the accountant noted \"numerous discrepancies\" and \"irregular payments\" in mid-June 2025. Timeline analysis reveals: 6 June 2025 (Second Respondent provides comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies), 7 June 2025 (Applicant cancels 15 UK business cards without notice). The card cancellation occurred one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation, not \"following\" any discovery. This demonstrates that the Applicant created the problem he now complains about.\n#### AD 7.6 - Financial Impact of Misconduct\n6.3 The Applicant alleges financial impact. The actual financial sabotage included: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) Revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025; (3) Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025 (100% audit data loss, seven days after my confrontation with Ms. Farrar); (4) Card cancellation 7 June 2025; (5) Domain theft 29 May 2025 (regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory, 14 days after my confrontation, Annexure **JF4**); (6) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 (R34.9M operations destroyed).\n#### AD 7.8 - Continuing Harm to Corporations\n6.4 The Applicant claims continuing harm. The harm was systematically inflicted. An email from Gee dated 20 June 2025 states she was instructed to send a \"don't use regima.zone only use regimaskin.co.za\" email (Annexure **JF8**). The domain regimaskin.co.za is owned by Adderory (Pty) Ltd (Ms. Farrar's son's company), not by RegimA. This diverted customers from the Second Respondent's platforms to a competing domain controlled by Ms. Farrar's family.\n#### AD 7.10 - Card Cancellations and Service Interruptions\n6.5 The Applicant claims he cancelled cards in June 2025 \"following\" the accountant's discovery and requested invoices from the Second Respondent. Timeline evidence demonstrates: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent provides comprehensive reports; (2) 7 June: Applicant cancels UK cards (5191, 5225) paying for Shopify subscriptions (Annexure **DF4**); (3) Cards cancelled one day after cooperation, not after any discovery. The cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible (card-based authentication), then the Applicant complained about missing documentation.\n#### AD 7.13 - Domain and Service Halts Due to Card Cancellations\n6.6 The Applicant claims subscriptions were halted due to card cancellations. To prevent business collapse, the Second Respondent substituted his personal card (1927) for RegimA SA and I substituted my personal card (3212) for RegimA Zone (Annexure **JF7**). Meanwhile, the competing domain regimaskin.co.za was actively diverting customers.\n#### AD 7.16 - Son's Interference with Business Operations\n6.7 The Applicant alleges the Second Respondent interfered with operations. The evidence demonstrates the Second Respondent built and managed 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually (Annexure **DF1**). The Second Respondent's partner, Kayla Pretorius, co-built these operations before her murder on 13 July 2023. After Kayla's death, a court order was obtained to seize her email account (kayp@rzo.io), which interfered with a law enforcement investigation that had instructed a freeze on the account (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.18 - Email and Account Access Interference\n6.8 The Applicant claims the Second Respondent restricted email access. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to his own email (pete@regima.com)\u2014controlled by Ms. Farrar; (2) Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 show Ms. Farrar using the Applicant's email (Annexure **SF2**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's; (4) Kayla's email was seized by court order after her murder (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.20 - Continued Interference Not in Corporate Interests\n6.9 The Applicant claims interference is not in corporate interests. The corporate interests were served by the Second Respondent's profitable operations (R34.9M annually). The interference came from: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Domain theft; (6) Warehouse sabotage. Each action occurred after either my debt inquiry (15 May) or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June).\n---\n### 7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 8.4-9.3: FINANCIAL DISCREPANCIES AND MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 8.4 - Discovery of Financial Discrepancies\n7.1 The Applicant claims the accountant discovered discrepancies. The accountant, Mr. Bantjies, is also: (1) Undisclosed trustee; (2) Debtor owing R18.685M; (3) Controller of financial systems; (4) Recipient of the Second Respondent's fraud report on 6 June 2025. Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025. The \"discovery\" occurred after the Second Respondent exposed fraud to the person facilitating it.\n#### AD 8.5 - Accountant's Attendance and Findings\n7.2 The Applicant states Mr. Bantjies attended for provisional tax and VAT submissions. The two years of unallocated expenses (dumped into RegimA Worldwide Distribution on 30 March 2025) occurred while: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled the accounting system using the Applicant's email; (2) Linda (Ms. Farrar's sister) was employed as bookkeeper (Annexure **SF8**); (3) Mr. Bantjies was the accountant. The question arises: why were expenses unallocated for two years if the accountant and bookkeeper were performing their duties?\n#### AD 8.7 - IT Expenses and Tax Problems\n7.3 The Applicant cites IT expenses: 2024 tax year R6,738,007.47; 2025 tax year R2,116,159.47. The Applicant claims these are \"almost entirely unexplainable.\" The context omitted from the founding affidavit is that these expenses supported 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. The IT expenses represent 19.3% of revenue (2024) and 6.1% of revenue (2025)\u2014reasonable for a global e-commerce operation. The Applicant fails to disclose the revenue context.\n#### AD 8.10 - International Expenses and Tax Implications\n7.4 The Applicant claims expenses are \"seemingly international\" and accounts have \"almost exceeded the yearly allowable quota for funds leaving South Africa.\" The Shopify platforms were funded by UK company RegimA Zone Ltd (company 10697009). UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The international expenses were legitimate costs of UK-owned e-commerce operations.\n#### AD 9.2 - Bank Message Regarding International Transfers\n7.5 The Applicant references bank messages about international transfers. The actual international payment flow is demonstrated by Shopify invoices: UK entities (RegimA Zone Ltd) funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The payment direction is UK \u2192 SA, not SA \u2192 UK as the Applicant's affidavit implies.\n#### AD 9.3 - Financial Misconduct Summary\n7.6 The Applicant summarizes alleged misconduct. The documented financial misconduct includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) without the Second Respondent's authority; (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments (Annexure **SF3**, **SF5**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments for this stock (SARS audit email, Annexure **SF4**); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023, unpaid despite Ms. Farrar's false claim to me that it was paid (Annexure **JF2**, **SF6**).\n---\n### 8. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1-10.14: APPLICATION TO DECLARE RESPONDENTS DELINQUENT\n#### AD 10.1 - Relief Sought - Delinquency or Probation\n8.1 The Applicant seeks delinquency or probation orders under Section 162. The evidence establishes grounds for the Applicant's own delinquency: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers in breach of fiduciary duty as co-director; (2) Card cancellation sabotage one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation; (3) False statements about UK payment flows; (4) Abuse of ex parte process through material non-disclosures.\n#### AD 10.3 - Delinquent Conduct of Respondents\n8.2 The Applicant alleges delinquent conduct by the Second Respondent and me. My actual conduct included: (1) Fulfilling fiduciary duty as trustee by investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025); (2) Confronting Ms. Farrar about profiting from proceeds of murder; (3) Being deceived by co-trustees into signing \"Main Trustee\" document (11 Aug 2025, Annexure **JF5**); (4) Being punished with interdict two days later (13 Aug 2025, Annexure **JF6**).\n#### AD 10.4 - Contravention of Companies Act\n8.3 The Applicant alleges Companies Act contraventions. Section 76(3)(b) requires directors to act in good faith and for a proper purpose. The Applicant's actions demonstrate bad faith: (1) Manufactured crisis (card cancellation day after cooperation); (2) Material non-disclosures in ex parte application; (3) False statements about UK operations; (4) Systematic sabotage of profitable businesses.\n#### AD 10.5.2 - Probation Relief Under Section 162\n8.4 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence reveals: Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) commissioned this affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths. Mr. Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery of the fraud the Second Respondent reported.\n#### AD 10.6 - Close Corporations Act - Fiduciary Duties\n8.5 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act fiduciary duties. The Act requires members to manage in the corporation's interest. RegimA Skin Treatments (CC) owes R1,035,000 to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023. Strategic Logistics (CC) lost R5.4M in stock that \"disappeared\"\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory. These transactions were not in the corporations' interests.\n#### AD 10.6.1 - Member's Duty to Manage in Corporation's Interest\n8.6 The Applicant cites duty to manage in corporation's interest. The R5.4M stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics represents 46% of annual sales\u201410 times the historical adjustment. Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments. This transaction was not in Strategic Logistics' interest.\n#### AD 10.6.2 - Member's Duty Not to Exceed Powers\n8.7 The Applicant cites duty not to exceed powers. The unauthorized R900,000 transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) were made without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director. The Applicant exceeded his powers by acting unilaterally.\n#### AD 10.6.3 - Member's Duty to Avoid Conflicts of Interest\n8.8 The Applicant cites duty to avoid conflicts. The evidence reveals multiple conflicts: (1) Mr. Bantjies: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant; (2) Ms. Farrar's son (Adderory) supplying stock to RegimA Skin Treatments while same stock type \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) Villa Via (trust-owned) charging 86% profit margin rent to group; (4) Regimaskin.co.za (owned by Ms. Farrar's son) competing with RegimA operations.\n#### AD 10.7 - Member Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n8.9 The Applicant invokes breach of fiduciary duty liability. The breaches are established: (1) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to the Second Respondent (co-director) by unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries (as trustee) by attacking them with interdict; (3) Mr. Bantjies breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries by dismissing audit request and facilitating fraud.\n#### AD 10.7.1.2 - Liability for Economic Benefit Derived\n8.10 The Applicant cites liability for economic benefit. The economic benefits derived include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (4) 86% profit margin on Villa Via rent; (5) Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za (Adderory).\n#### AD 10.7.1.4 - Liability for Loss Suffered by Corporation\n8.11 The Applicant cites liability for corporate loss. The losses suffered include: (1) RegimA SA: R900K unauthorized transfers, revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025, Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025; (2) RegimA Zone: Customer diversion to competing domain, card cancellation sabotage; (3) Strategic Logistics: R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (4) RegimA Worldwide: Forced to pay 2 years of unallocated expenses from all companies.\n#### AD 10.8 - Disqualification for Misconduct Under Section 47\n8.12 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act Section 47 disqualification. This section applies when a member is guilty of gross negligence or fraud. The R5.4M stock adjustment (46% of sales, 10x historical) in Strategic Logistics, with Ms. Farrar claiming Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments, and the same stock type supplied by Adderory, suggests systematic fraud.\n#### AD 10.8.1 - Declaration of Delinquency as Alternative Relief\n8.13 The Applicant seeks delinquency declaration. The evidence supports declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5): (1) Intentional harm to companies (systematic sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent conduct (card cancellation without notice); (3) Breach of trust (attacking beneficiaries as trustee); (4) Abuse of process (ex parte order based on material non-disclosures and false statements).\n#### AD 10.9 - Mandatory Disqualification Under Section 162(5)\n8.14 The Applicant invokes Section 162(5) mandatory disqualification grounds. These grounds apply to the Applicant's conduct: (1) Intentional harm to companies (R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent harm (card cancellation rendering documentation inaccessible); (3) Breach of trust (trustee attacking beneficiaries).\n#### AD 10.9.2 - Intentional or Grossly Negligent Harm\n8.15 The Applicant alleges intentional or grossly negligent harm by respondents. The intentional harm was inflicted by the Applicant and his co-conspirators: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent cooperates; (2) 7 June: Cards cancelled; (3) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days after my inquiry); (4) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days after my inquiry); (5) 8 July: Warehouse sabotaged; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action followed either my debt inquiry or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure.\n#### AD 10.9.3 - Manner of Acting - Gross Negligence or Misconduct\n8.16 The Applicant alleges gross negligence or misconduct. The gross negligence is demonstrated by: Cancelling 15 business cards without notice, rendering documentation inaccessible, then complaining about missing documentation. This demonstrates consciousness of guilt and bad faith.\n#### AD 10.9.3.1 - Gross Negligence or Wilful Misconduct\n8.17 The Applicant alleges wilful misconduct. The wilful misconduct includes: (1) Systematic revenue diversion (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (2) Data destruction (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Card sabotage (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). This six-month campaign occurred after I investigated fraud and the Second Respondent exposed fraud.\n#### AD 10.9.3.2 - Acquiescence to Fraudulent Acts\n8.18 The Applicant alleges acquiescence to fraud. The acquiescence to fraud includes: (1) Two years of unallocated expenses while Ms. Farrar controlled systems using the Applicant's email and Linda was employed as bookkeeper; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" with Mr. Bantjies allegedly instructing payments; (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate unpaid since Feb 2023; (4) Villa Via 86% profit margin rent extraction.\n#### AD 10.9.3.3 - Party to Omission with Fraudulent Purpose\n8.19 The Applicant alleges omission with fraudulent purpose. The omissions with fraudulent purpose include: (1) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's trustee status from affidavit; (2) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Applicant omitted R34.9M revenue context for IT expenses; (4) Applicant omitted UK \u2192 SA payment flow (claimed opposite); (5) Applicant omitted timeline showing card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation; (6) Applicant omitted my debt inquiry and subsequent retaliation.\n#### AD 10.10 - Probation Under Section 162(7)\n8.20 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162(7). This section applies when conduct is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) I fulfilled fiduciary duty by investigating debt, then was punished with interdict; (2) Second Respondent exposed fraud to accountant, then suffered six-month sabotage campaign; (3) Both excluded from profitable businesses we built.\n#### AD 10.10.2.3 - Oppressive or Prejudicial Exercise of Powers\n8.21 The Applicant alleges oppressive exercise of powers. The oppressive exercise of powers includes: (1) Applicant used trustee powers to attack beneficiaries; (2) Mr. Bantjies used trustee powers to dismiss audit request and facilitate fraud; (3) Applicant used director powers to make unauthorized R900K transfers; (4) Applicant used court process to obtain ex parte order based on material non-disclosures.\n#### AD 10.10.2.4 - Conduct with Oppressive or Prejudicial Result\n8.22 The Applicant alleges conduct with prejudicial result. The prejudicial results include: (1) I was excluded from companies after investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent excluded from R34.9M operations he built; (3) Customers diverted to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son; (4) R900K transferred without authorization; (5) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (6) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate unpaid.\n#### AD 10.10.22 - Business Conducted in Oppressive Manner\n8.23 The Applicant alleges oppressive business conduct. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled all systems using Applicant's email while claiming to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions; (2) Applicant had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems; (3) Two years of expenses unallocated despite employed bookkeeper; (4) Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) dismissed fraud investigation.\n#### AD 10.10.41 - Conduct Inconsistent with Duties\n8.24 The Applicant alleges conduct inconsistent with duties. The conduct inconsistent with duties includes: (1) Trustee attacking beneficiaries (Applicant, Mr. Bantjies); (2) Director making unauthorized transfers (Applicant); (3) Trustee dismissing fraud investigation (Mr. Bantjies); (4) Accountant facilitating fraud while being debtor (Mr. Bantjies); (5) Administrator controlling systems while diverting revenue (Ms. Farrar).\n#### AD 10.13 - Unaccounted Money - Significant Sums\n8.25 The Applicant alleges unaccounted money. The unaccounted money includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023; (4) R1.73 million transferred 11 Sep 2025; (5) Two years of unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide on 30 Mar 2025.\n#### AD 10.14 - Full Extent of Transgressions Not Yet Determined\n8.26 The Applicant claims full extent not yet determined. The full extent includes: (1) Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email; (4) Ms. Farrar's son's competing domain; (5) Adderory's stock supply relationship; (6) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme; (7) Court order seizing Kayla's email during law enforcement investigation.\n---\n### 9. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 11.2-12.4: UK OPERATIONS AND ALLEGED FRAUD\n#### AD 11.2 - UK Head Office - RegimA UK Ltd\n9.1 The Applicant describes UK operations. RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The UK company is the economic owner of the e-commerce operations.\n#### AD 11.3 - Directors of UK Entity\n9.2 The Applicant describes UK directors. The UK company was established by the Second Respondent and Kayla to own and operate the global e-commerce platforms. After Kayla's murder (13 July 2023), the Second Respondent continued managing the operations.\n#### AD 11.4 - Applicant's Role in Operations\n9.3 The Applicant describes his role. The evidence demonstrates the Applicant had no operational role: (1) No access to email (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (4) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's. The Applicant appears to be a figurehead.\n#### AD 11.6 - UK Branch Operations\n9.4 The Applicant describes UK branch operations. The UK company funded SA operations through Shopify subscription payments. Shopify invoices demonstrate UK \u2192 SA payment flow of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The UK company invested in SA operations, not the reverse.\n#### AD 11.8 - UK Financial Concerns\n9.5 The Applicant expresses UK financial concerns. The financial concerns were manufactured: (1) Card cancellation 7 June 2025 disrupted UK funding; (2) Domain theft 29 May 2025 diverted customers; (3) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 destroyed UK-funded operations; (4) Data expungement 22 May 2025 eliminated audit trail.\n#### AD 12.1 - UK Branch Non-Payment and Fraud Concerns\n9.6 The Applicant alleges UK branch non-payment and fraud. The Shopify invoices prove the opposite: UK entities funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). UK bank transactions corroborate the invoices (Annexure **DF8**). The Applicant's statement is demonstrably false.\n#### AD 12.2 - Misappropriation Leading to Insolvency Risk\n9.7 The Applicant alleges misappropriation leading to insolvency. The actual insolvency risk was created by: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (3) Data expungement (22 May); (4) Card cancellation (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). Despite six months of sabotage, the Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied.\n#### AD 12.3 - Purpose of Court Application\n9.8 The Applicant states the purpose is to prevent further harm. The actual purpose appears to be: (1) Punish me for investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May); (2) Punish Second Respondent for exposing Villa Via fraud (6 June); (3) Seize control of R34.9M operations Second Respondent built; (4) Prevent forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and the systematic fraud.\n#### AD 12.4 - Alternative Roles for Wife and Son\n9.9 The Applicant suggests alternative roles for the Second Respondent and me. The evidence demonstrates: (1) I fulfilled trustee duties by investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent built and managed R34.9M profitable operations; (3) Both were systematically sabotaged after investigating/exposing fraud; (4) Both were attacked with interdict by co-trustees; (5) I was included in interdict two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document.\n---\n### 10. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 13.2-13.8: REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERDICTORY RELIEF\n#### AD 13.2 - Clear Right Not to Be Prejudiced\n10.1 The Applicant claims clear right not to be prejudiced. The Applicant has no clear right: (1) He manufactured the crisis (card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (2) He made unauthorized R900K transfers; (3) He had alternative remedies as trustee with \"additional powers\"; (4) He obtained order through material non-disclosures (Mr. Bantjies's trustee status, debtor status, timeline manipulation, UK payment flow misrepresentation).\n#### AD 13.2.2 - Injury Sustained and Apprehension of Further Harm\n10.2 The Applicant claims injury and apprehension of harm. The Applicant suffered no injury he didn't inflict on himself: (1) Card cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible; (2) Unauthorized transfers depleted accounts; (3) Revenue diversions reduced cash flow; (4) Warehouse sabotage destroyed operations. The apprehension of further harm was manufactured to justify ex parte relief.\n#### AD 13.3 - Reasonable Apprehension of Irreparable Harm\n10.3 The Applicant claims reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm. The irreparable harm was inflicted by the Applicant's six-month sabotage campaign: (1) R34.9M operations destroyed (93.3% revenue collapse); (2) Customer relationships diverted to competing domain; (3) Audit data expunged (100% loss); (4) Documentation rendered inaccessible; (5) Accounts emptied. The Second Respondent and I suffered irreparable harm, not the Applicant.\n#### AD 13.4 - Interdicts Essential for Corporation Survival\n10.4 The Applicant claims interdicts essential for survival. The corporations were profitable under the Second Respondent's management (R34.9M annually). The survival threat came from the Applicant's sabotage: (1) Unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data destruction; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Excluding the Second Respondent and me threatened survival, not ensured it.\n#### AD 13.5 - Balance of Convenience Favours Granting Relief\n10.5 The Applicant claims balance of convenience favors relief. The balance overwhelmingly favors the Second Respondent and me: (1) We built and managed profitable operations; (2) We investigated and exposed fraud; (3) We were systematically sabotaged for doing so; (4) We substituted personal cards to prevent business collapse; (5) We support independent forensic audit. The Applicant obtained relief through material non-disclosures and false statements.\n#### AD 13.8 - Other Relief Sought in Part A\n10.6 The Applicant seeks additional relief. The relief was obtained ex parte based on: (1) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Omitting timeline showing card cancellation day after cooperation; (4) Falsely claiming UK owes SA (opposite is true); (5) Omitting R34.9M revenue context; (6) Omitting my debt inquiry and retaliation pattern.\n---\n### 11. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1-14.5: FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND FORENSIC AUDIT\n#### AD 14.1 - Financial Constraints on Respondents\n11.1 The Applicant seeks financial constraints on the Second Respondent and me. The financial constraints were already imposed through sabotage: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Despite six months of sabotage, the Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors.\n#### AD 14.3 - Constraint to Prevent Financial Prejudice\n11.2 The Applicant seeks constraints to prevent prejudice. The prejudice was inflicted by the Applicant: (1) RegimA SA account opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 (Feb-Mar 2025); (2) 169 customer deposits R566,598.57 proving active trade; (3) R1.73M transferred 11 Sep 2025; (4) R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage.\n#### AD 14.4 - Forensic Audit Necessity and Remuneration\n11.3 The Applicant seeks forensic audit. The Second Respondent and I support independent forensic audit by an impartial party. Such audit would reveal: (1) Mr. Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant); (2) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme (Strategic Logistics \u2192 Adderory \u2192 RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (4) Two years unallocated expenses; (5) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (6) Revenue diversion scheme; (7) Ms. Farrar's control of systems using Applicant's email.\n#### AD 14.5 - Request for Relief Under Part B\n11.4 The Applicant requests Part B relief. The relief should include: (1) Setting aside ex parte order obtained through material non-disclosures; (2) Independent forensic audit; (3) Investigation of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts; (4) Investigation of R5.4M stock \"disappearance\"; (5) Recovery of R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (6) Investigation of Ms. Farrar's control and Adderory's role; (7) Consideration of Applicant's delinquency under Section 162(5).\n---\n### 12. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1-16.12: DISCOVERY AND URGENCY\n#### AD 16.1 - Discovery of Respondents' Conduct\n12.1 The Applicant claims discovery of conduct in mid-June 2025. The actual discovery timeline: (1) 15 May: I discovered R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (2) 6 June: Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies; (3) 7 June: Applicant cancelled cards (day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (4) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed audit request. The Applicant's \"discovery\" was actually consciousness of guilt after the Second Respondent exposed fraud to Mr. Bantjies.\n#### AD 16.2 - R600,000 Transfer as Trigger for Action\n12.2 The Applicant cites R600,000 transfer (later corrected to R500,000) as trigger. The actual triggers were: (1) 15 May: I confronted Ms. Farrar about R1,035,000 debt and \"profiting from proceeds of murder\"; (2) 6 June: Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed audit request. The R500,000 transfer is a pretext.\n#### AD 16.5 - Unawareness of Urgent Application Process\n12.3 The Applicant claims unawareness of urgent process. The Applicant had access to legal advice and Mr. Bantjies as Commissioner of Oaths. The delay from mid-June to August contradicts urgency. The actual urgency appears to be preventing forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and systematic fraud.\n#### AD 16.6 - Delay Would Have Been Avoided\n12.4 The Applicant claims delay would have been avoided if he knew the process. The two-month delay (mid-June to August) contradicts urgency. The timing suggests: (1) Waiting to see if Second Respondent's audit request would proceed; (2) Coordinating with Mr. Bantjies (who dismissed audit request 10 June); (3) Preparing my punishment (included in interdict 13 Aug, two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document 11 Aug).\n#### AD 16.8 - State of Shock and Delayed Response\n12.5 The Applicant claims state of shock. The Applicant was not in shock\u2014he was executing a systematic sabotage campaign: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping; (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 7 Jun: Card cancellation; (6) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (7) 11 Sep: Account emptying. This is not shock\u2014this is systematic execution.\n#### AD 16.10 - Attorney Consultation Timeline\n12.6 The Applicant describes attorney consultation. The consultation occurred after: (1) My debt inquiry (15 May); (2) Data expungement (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June); (5) Card cancellation (7 June); (6) Mr. Bantjies's audit dismissal (10 June). The legal action was retaliation, not discovery.\n#### AD 16.12 - Need for Urgent Court Assistance\n12.7 The Applicant claims need for urgent assistance. The Applicant had alternative remedies: (1) Trustee with \"additional powers\" as Founder; (2) Could have conducted audit as trustee; (3) Could have consulted with co-trustee (me) instead of attacking me; (4) Could have consulted with co-trustee Mr. Bantjies (who was facilitating the fraud). The Applicant chose ex parte process to avoid disclosure of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and systematic sabotage.\n---\n### 13. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 17.3-17.4: EX PARTE BASIS\n#### AD 17.3 - Ex Parte Basis for Application\n13.1 The Applicant justifies ex parte application. The ex parte process was abused through material non-disclosures: (1) Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Timeline manipulation (card cancellation day after cooperation); (4) UK payment flow misrepresentation (claimed SA \u2192 UK, actually UK \u2192 SA); (5) R34.9M revenue context omission; (6) My debt inquiry and retaliation pattern; (7) Second Respondent's fraud exposure and retaliation pattern; (8) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email; (9) Adderory's competing domain; (10) R5.4M stock \"disappearance.\"\n#### AD 17.4 - Urgency Justifies Ex Parte Relief\n13.2 The Applicant claims urgency justifies ex parte relief. The urgency was manufactured: (1) Two-month delay contradicts urgency; (2) Card cancellation day after cooperation shows consciousness of guilt; (3) Systematic sabotage from Feb-Sep shows premeditation; (4) I was included two days after signing document, showing coordination; (5) Alternative remedies available as trustee. The ex parte relief was obtained to prevent the Second Respondent and me from exposing the material non-disclosures and systematic fraud.\n---\n### 14. RESPONSE TO REMAINING AD PARAGRAPHS (18.3, 20, 22, 40.9.4, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, 88)\n#### AD 18.3 - Continual Unauthorized Fund Transfers\n14.1 The Applicant alleges continual unauthorized transfers. The unauthorized transfers were made by the Applicant: R450,000 on 14 Feb 2025 + R450,000 on 15 Feb 2025 = R900,000 total from RegimA SA without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director. RegimA SA account: opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 within one month despite 169 customer deposits R566,598.57.\n#### AD 20 - First and Second Respondent Details\n14.2 The Applicant provides the Second Respondent's and my details.

The gross abuse includes: (1) Applicant made R900K unauthorized transfers as director; (2) Applicant cancelled cards without notice as director; (3) Applicant used trustee position to attack beneficiaries; (4) Mr. Bantjies used trustee position to dismiss audit and facilitate fraud; (5) Ms. Farrar used administrative position to control systems, divert revenue, and facilitate son's competing domain.\n#### AD 44 - Applicant Identity Details\n14.5 The Applicant confirms identity. The Applicant's actual position: (1) No access to email (pete@regima.com controlled by Ms. Farrar); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (4) Debtor to Mr. Bantjies (R18.685M due May 2026); (5) Figurehead while Ms. Farrar claims to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions.\n#### AD 50 - Registered Address Details\n14.6 The Applicant provides address: 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview. This is also my address. The Applicant attacked me (co-trustee, beneficiary) with interdict two days after I signed \"Main Trustee\" document, punishing me for investigating R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate and supporting the Second Respondent.\n#### AD 74 - Timeline Context\n14.7 The Applicant provides timeline context. The actual timeline: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping (12-hour deadline); (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 15 May: My debt inquiry; (6) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days later); (7) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days later); (8) 6 Jun: Second Respondent's fraud exposure; (9) 7 Jun: Cards cancelled (1 day later); (10) 10 Jun: Audit dismissed; (11) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotaged; (12) 11 Aug: I sign document; (13) 13 Aug: I included in interdict (2 days later); (14) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied.\n#### AD 78 - Accountant's Office Visit and Discovery\n14.8 The Applicant describes Mr. Bantjies's office visit. The visit occurred after: (1) Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025; (2) Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) Applicant cancelled cards on 7 June 2025 (day after Second Respondent's cooperation). Mr. Bantjies \"discovered\" irregularities after the Second Respondent reported fraud to him. Mr. Bantjies then dismissed audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\"\n#### AD 83 - Irregular Payments Discovery\n14.9 The Applicant describes discovery of irregular payments. The irregular payments include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers by Applicant (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics (same type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments (SARS audit email); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023 (Ms. Farrar falsely claimed paid to me on 15 May 2025).\n#### AD 88 - Follow-up Actions\n14.10 The Applicant describes follow-up actions. The follow-up actions include: (1) 7 Jun: Card cancellation (day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (2) 10 Jun: Mr. Bantjies dismisses audit; (3) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (4) 11 Aug: I was deceived into signing document; (5) 13 Aug: I was included in interdict; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action was retaliation against me (15 May debt inquiry) and the Second Respondent (6 Jun fraud exposure).\n---\n### 15. PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n15.1 I respectfully request that this Honourable Court:\n15.1.1 Set aside the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025 on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n15.1.2 Dismiss the Applicant's application for delinquency or probation orders against the Second Respondent and me.\n15.1.3 Grant a counter-application declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008, on the grounds of:\n- Intentional harm to companies through systematic sabotage;\n- Grossly negligent conduct in card cancellation without notice;\n- Breach of fiduciary duty to beneficiaries as trustee;\n- Abuse of court process through material non-disclosures and false statements.\n15.1.4 Order an independent forensic audit by an impartial auditor to investigate:\n- Mr. Bantjies's conflicts of interest (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant);\n- R5.4 million stock transfer pricing scheme;\n- R1,035,000 debt to Kayla Pretorius's estate;\n- Two years of unallocated expenses;\n- Unauthorized R900,000 transfers;\n- Revenue diversion scheme;\n- Ms. Farrar's control of systems and Adderory's role.\n15.1.5 Order the Applicant to pay the costs of this application on the scale as between attorney and client.\n15.1.6 Grant such further and/or alternative relief as this Honourable Court deems fit.\n---\n### 16. CONCLUSION\n16.1 The evidence presented in this affidavit demonstrates that I fulfilled my fiduciary duties as a trustee by investigating a substantial debt owed to a deceased beneficiary's estate. I confronted Ms. Farrar about this debt on 15 May 2025, stating that keeping the funds would constitute profiting from the proceeds of murder.\n16.2 Within seven days of my inquiry, Shopify data was expunged, eliminating the audit trail. Within 14 days, a competing domain was registered by Ms. Farrar's son's company, diverting customers from the Second Respondent's operations.\n16.3 On 11 August 2025, I was deceived by my co-trustees into signing a \"Main Trustee\" document that backdated the Applicant's designation to 1 July 2025. Two days later, on 13 August 2025, the Applicant and Mr. Bantjies included me in this interdict.\n16.4 The ex parte order was obtained through material non-disclosures, including Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status, his R18.685 million debt to the trust, the timeline showing card cancellation one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation, false statements about UK payment flows, and the omission of the R34.9 million revenue context.\n16.5 The Second Respondent and I support an independent forensic audit by an impartial party. Such an audit would reveal the systematic fraud, conflicts of interest, and abuse of process that underlie this application.\n16.6 I respectfully submit that the balance of convenience overwhelmingly favors setting aside the ex parte order and granting the relief sought in this affidavit.\n---\n**SIGNED at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025.**\n---\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**  \nFirst Respondent\n---\n**THUS SIGNED AND SWORN TO before me at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025, the Deponent having acknowledged that she knows and understands the contents of this Affidavit, that she has no objection to taking the prescribed oath, and that she considers the oath to be binding on her conscience.**\n---\n**COMMISSIONER OF OATHS**\n---\n## LIST OF ANNEXURES\n**JF1:** Trust deed and trustee documentation  \n**JF2:** Email correspondence re R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025)  \n**JF3:** Rynette's false statement documentation  \n**JF4:** Domain registration records (regimaskin.co.za, 29 May 2025)  \n**JF5:** \"Main Trustee\" document (signed 11 Aug 2025, backdated to 1 July 2025)  \n**JF6:** Interdict order (13 Aug 2025)  \n**JF7:** Personal card statements (substitution to prevent collapse)  \n**JF8:** Email from Gee re domain diversion (20 June 2025)\n**DF1:** Shopify operations overview (51+ stores, R34.9M revenue)  \n**DF2:** Villa Via fraud analysis (86% profit margin)  \n**DF3:** Email correspondence with Bantjies (6 June 2025)  \n**DF4:** Card cancellation records (7 June 2025)  \n**DF5-DF7:** Shopify invoices (UK \u2192 SA payment flow, R84,661+ annually)  \n**DF8:** UK bank transactions (corroborating Shopify payments)  \n**DF9:** Unauthorized transfer records (R450K + R450K = R900K, 14-15 Feb 2025)  \n**DF10:** RegimA SA account statements (opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08)  \n**DF11:** Customer deposit records (169 deposits, R566,598.57)  \n**DF12:** Revenue diversion documentation (1 Mar, 14 Apr, 11 Sep 2025)  \n**DF13:** Warehouse sabotage instruction (8 July 2025)  \n**DF14:** Expense dumping documentation (30 Mar 2025)\n**SF1:** Bantjies debt documentation (R18.685M, investment payout schedule)  \n**SF2:** Sage screenshots (Rynette using pete@regima.com, June & Aug 2025)  \n**SF3:** Strategic Logistics R5.4M stock adjustment documentation  \n**SF4:** SARS audit email (Rynette claiming Bantjies instructed payments)  \n**SF5:** Adderory company registration and stock supply documentation  \n**SF6:** Kayla Pretorius estate documentation (R1,035,000 debt)  \n**SF7:** Court order seizing Kayla's email account  \n**SF8:** Linda employment records (bookkeeper)\n---\n**END OF AFFIDAVIT**",

No Urgency for Applicant\n\u2022 Peter claimed urgency only in July when Jacqui and Daniel were trying to resolve\nSARS audit\n\u2022 Complete mischaracterization to claim urgency and manipulate timeline proximity\n\u2022 67-day delay between Daniel's reports (June 6) and interdict (August 13) contradicts\nurgency\n2. Actual Urgency for Respondents\n\u2022 Financial impact due to Peter's actions\n\u2022 Rynette (bookkeeper) doing all banking transactions daily\n\u2022 Jacqui and Daniel unable to see any accounts\n\u2022 Massive impact on RegimA Skin Treatments from incompetent bookkeeper\n3. Jacqui's Essential Role\n\u2022 CEO who launched RegimA Skin Treatments 33 years ago\n\u2022 Built company into one of SA's most successful skin treatment companies\n\u2022 Won all major industry awards\n\u2022 Every word ever written about RegimA written by Jacqui\n\u2022 Treated thousands of patients referred from leading plastic surgeons\n\u2022 Only person at RegimA office who can treat patients\n\u2022 Essential for UK and European business as Responsible Person\n4. Price Increase Sabotage\n\u2022 Annual price increase usually done by Daniel (mathematician)\n\u2022 Bookkeeper did it instead and caused \"dreadful harm\" to the structure\n\u2022 Demonstrates incompetence and operational damage\n5. Card Cancellations\n\u2022 All card cancellations carried out by Peter alone in secret\n\u2022 Nobody informed Jacqui or Daniel\n\u2022 Peter cancelled all worldwide FNB cards, specifically Jacqui and Dan's cards\n\u2022 Payments defaulted because of secret cancellations\n6. Rynette's Interference\n\u2022 Took RegimA logo and IP information and put it in her son's name\n\u2022 Sent emails instructing RegimA database not to use regima.zone email addresses\n\u2022 Used new addresses she put in place (regimaskin.co.za)\n\u2022 Did this without informing Jacqui or Daniel\n\u2022 Cancelled regima.zone email addresses\n\u2022 Impersonated Peter using pete@regima.com\n7. System Cancellations\n\u2022 Peter instructed Rynette to cancel all Shopify and other systems\n\u2022 These systems had been set up to automate sales\n\u2022 Were working very well (same system UK successfully uses)\n\u2022 Deliberate sabotage of profitable operations\nSection 5: Financial Discrepancies (AD 8.4-9.3)\nJax's Core Arguments:\n1.

manufactured crisis\n- Section 76(3)(b) of Companies Act - bad faith and improper purpose\n- Section 162(5) of Companies Act - grounds for Peter's delinquency\n- Section 9(1) of Trust Property Control Act - trustee duties\n- Requirements for interdictory relief (clear right, harm, balance of convenience)\n### Strategic Recommendations\n- Emphasize manufactured crisis argument\n- Highlight retaliation pattern\n- Leverage Shopify invoice evidence for perjury\n- Support independent forensic audit\n- Pursue counter-application for Peter's delinquency\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nSent: Saturday, 01 November 2025 14:30\nTo: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.com>; Daniel Faucitt <d@rzo.io>; regizone <regizone@proton.me>\nSubject: AD NOTES - JACQUELINE FAUCITT \n## ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT: JACQUELINE FAUCITT\n**IN THE HIGH COURT OF SOUTH AFRICA**  \n**GAUTENG DIVISION, PRETORIA**\n**Case No:** 2025-137857\n**In the matter between:**\n**PETER ANDREW FAUCITT** \u2014 Applicant\nand\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT** \u2014 First Respondent  \n**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT** \u2014 Second Respondent  \n*(and others)*\n---\n## I, THE UNDERSIGNED\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**\ndo hereby make oath and state that:\n---\n### 1. INTRODUCTION AND CAPACITY\n1.1 I am the First Respondent in this matter, an adult female, and a South African citizen residing at 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview.\n1.2 I am a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust (IT 3651/2013) and a Beneficiary of the same trust. I am also a co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (2017/087935/07) and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (2011/005722/07), both of which are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust.\n1.3 The facts deposed to in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and belief, save where the context indicates otherwise, and are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\n1.4 Where I make legal submissions, I do so on the advice of my legal representatives.\n---\n### 2. PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT\n2.1 This affidavit is filed in response to the Applicant's founding affidavit and the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025.\n2.2 I oppose the relief sought by the Applicant and seek to have the ex parte order set aside on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n2.3 I address each of the Applicant's allegations in the order they appear in the founding affidavit, following the AD paragraph sequence.\n---\n### 3. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 1-3.13: PARTIES AND STRUCTURE\n#### AD 1 - Director Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n3.1 The Applicant invokes provisions relating to director liability for breach of fiduciary duty. I note that the accounting system used to track the alleged breaches was controlled by Rynette Farrar using the Applicant's email address (pete@regima.com), as evidenced by Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 (Annexure **SF2**). The Applicant himself had no access to this system.\n#### AD 1.3 - Applicant's Personal Details and Declaration\n3.2 The Applicant's personal details are noted. I observe that this affidavit was commissioned by Danie Jacobus Bantjies, identified as \"our accountant.\" The full extent of Mr. Bantjies's roles will become apparent through the evidence presented herein.\n#### AD 2 - Company Business Conduct Requirements\n3.3 The Applicant alleges reckless or grossly negligent business conduct. The financial performance of the companies demonstrates the contrary. The Second Respondent and his late partner, Kayla Pretorius, built 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. RegimA SA operates 25 stores with R8.5 million turnover, while RegimA Zone operates 26 stores with R26.4 million turnover. The businesses were highly profitable under the Second Respondent's management.\n#### AD 2.4 - Parties to the Application - Introduction\n3.4 The Applicant introduces the parties. The corporate structure reveals that certain entities are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust, which has three trustees. Two are identified in the founding affidavit: the Applicant and myself. The third trustee's identity was not disclosed to the beneficiaries until recently.\n#### AD 3 - Court Order for Probation of Directors/Members\n3.5 The Applicant seeks probation orders under Section 162 of the Companies Act. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence will demonstrate that the accountant who allegedly \"discovered\" the irregularities has multiple undisclosed roles that create impermissible conflicts.\n#### AD 3.2 - Respondents - Wife\n3.6 I am correctly identified as the Applicant's wife and First Respondent. On 15 May 2025, I confronted Rynette Farrar regarding a debt of R1,035,000 owed by RegimA Skin Treatments CC to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd since February 2023 (Annexure **JF2**). These funds were part of Kayla Pretorius's estate. I informed Ms. Farrar that keeping these funds would constitute profiting from the proceeds of murder. This confrontation proved significant in the events that followed.\n#### AD 3.4 - Respondents - Son\n3.7 The Second Respondent is correctly identified as the Applicant's son. On 6 June 2025, the Second Respondent cooperated with the Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports to the accountant regarding Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC, which is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust (Annexure **DF3**). The Second Respondent unknowingly reported fraud to one of the perpetrators.\n#### AD 3.4.2 - Third Respondent - RegimA Skin Treatments\n3.8 RegimA Skin Treatments CC (B1992/005371/23) owes R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, part of Kayla Pretorius's estate, since February 2023. When I raised this debt on 15 May 2025, Ms. Farrar claimed it was paid\u2014a statement I have since determined to be false. RegimA Skin Treatments receives stock from Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure **SF5**).\n#### AD 3.6 - Fourth Respondent - Regim A UK\n3.9 RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). This contradicts claims made later in the founding affidavit regarding UK entities owing money to SA operations.\n#### AD 3.6.1 - Fifth Respondent - Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC\n3.10 Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC (1996/004451/23) is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. Financial analysis reveals an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group\u2014an excessive profit extraction (Annexure **DF2**). This was the fraud the Second Respondent reported to the accountant on 6 June 2025.\n#### AD 3.6.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Villa Via Arcadia\n3.11 Property registration confirms trust ownership. The trust has three trustees, but only two were known to the beneficiaries at the time of this application.\n#### AD 3.7 - Sixth Respondent - Strategic Logistics CC\n3.12 Strategic Logistics CC (2008/136496/23) experienced a R5.4 million stock adjustment in 2024\u2014stock that allegedly \"just disappeared\" (Annexure **SF3**). This represents 46% of annual sales (R5.4M on R11.3M sales) and is 10 times the prior year's adjustment. The stock type matches inventory supplied by Adderory (Pty) Ltd to RegimA Skin Treatments.\n#### AD 3.7.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Strategic Logistics\n3.13 Property registration documents are noted. In a SARS audit email concerning the R5.4M stock adjustment, Ms. Farrar claimed that Danie Bantjies instructed her to make the substantial payments related to this transaction (Annexure **SF4**).\n#### AD 3.8 - Seventh Respondent - FirstRand Bank (FNB)\n3.14 FNB holds accounts for the companies. On 14 and 15 February 2025, unauthorized transfers of R450,000 each (R900,000 total) were made from RegimA SA's FNB account without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director (Annexure **DF9**). The account opened with R997,597.94 and closed at R5,284.08 within one month, despite 169 customer deposits totaling R566,598.57 proving active trade (Annexure **DF10**, **DF11**).\n#### AD 3.9 - Eighth and Ninth Respondents\n3.15 ABSA Bank and CIPC are cited. Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution began with an ABSA bank letter dated 14 April 2025 (Annexure **DF12**).\n#### AD 3.11 - Reference to Respondents as Wife and Son\n3.16 The Applicant refers to the Second Respondent and me as \"my wife\" and \"my son.\" Both of us are beneficiaries of the Faucitt Family Trust. I am also a co-trustee. The Trust Property Control Act, 57 of 1988, Section 9(1) requires trustees to act with care, diligence, and skill in the interests of beneficiaries.\n#### AD 3.13 - Court Jurisdiction and Identity Confirmation\n3.17 Jurisdiction is confirmed. The affidavit was commissioned by Danie Bantjies, who signed as \"Commissioner of Oaths.\" Mr. Bantjies's accounting firm is \"Bantjes and Company.\" His full relationship to the trust and companies will be revealed through the evidence presented herein.\n---\n### 4. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTANT DETAILS - BANTJIES CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n#### AD 4 - Accountant Details - Bantjes and Company\n4.1 The Applicant identifies \"our accountant\" as Danie Jacobus Bantjies of \"Bantjes and Company,\" who attended the office in mid-June 2025. What the Applicant does not disclose are the following material facts:\n4.1.1 Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust\u2014a status that was unknown to the beneficiaries, the Second Respondent and myself, until recently.\n4.1.2 Mr. Bantjies is a debtor to the trust, owing R18.685 million on an investment payout schedule with payments due in May 2026, May 2027, and May 2029 (Annexure **SF1**).\n4.1.3 Mr. Bantjies controls the financial systems and gave instructions to Ms. Farrar for multi-million rand transactions, as evidenced by emails (Annexure **SF4**).\n4.1.4 Mr. Bantjies was \"running the companies\" when the Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud on 6 June 2025.\n4.1.5 Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\"\n4.2 This creates an impermissible conflict of interest: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant + Company Controller. Mr. Bantjies had a direct financial interest in preventing discovery of the fraud the Second Respondent reported.\n---\n### 5. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1-6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE\n#### AD 6.1 - Relationships Between Parties\n5.1 The Applicant describes family and corporate relationships. The evidence demonstrates a different control structure. Ms. Farrar controlled all bank accounts (the Applicant had no access), controlled the Sage accounting system using the Applicant's email (pete@regima.com), and claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions rather than the Applicant's (Annexure **SF2**). Ms. Farrar's sister, Linda, was employed as bookkeeper, yet two years of expenses remained unallocated until 30 March 2025 (Annexure **SF8**).\n#### AD 6.3 - Directors and Members of Respondent Entities\n5.2 The Applicant describes directorships. The Second Respondent and I are co-directors of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd. RegimA Worldwide Distribution is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. On 30 March 2025, Ms. Farrar and the Applicant dumped two years of unallocated expenses into RegimA Worldwide Distribution and demanded the Second Respondent sign off within 12 hours for SARS VAT and Annual Accounts (Annexure **DF14**). The Second Respondent used this deadline extension (until 6 June) to finalize reports and uncover the Villa Via fraud.\n#### AD 6.5 - Banking and Registration of Respondent Entities\n5.3 The Applicant describes banking arrangements. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to any bank accounts; (2) Ms. Farrar controlled all accounts; (3) Revenue diversion for RegimA SA started 1 March 2025; (4) Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution started 14 April 2025 (ABSA bank letter); (5) On 11 September 2025, R1.73 million was transferred from accounts (Annexure **DF12**).\n---\n### 6. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7-7.20: URGENCY AND ALLEGED MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 7 - Urgency and Delay Considerations\n6.1 The Applicant claims urgency. The timeline reveals: (1) Alleged discovery mid-June 2025; (2) Application filed August 2025; (3) Two-month delay contradicts urgency. The actual urgency relates to the Second Respondent's fraud exposure on 6 June and my debt inquiry on 15 May.\n#### AD 7.3 - Urgency Details\n6.2 The Applicant claims the accountant noted \"numerous discrepancies\" and \"irregular payments\" in mid-June 2025. Timeline analysis reveals: 6 June 2025 (Second Respondent provides comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies), 7 June 2025 (Applicant cancels 15 UK business cards without notice). The card cancellation occurred one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation, not \"following\" any discovery. This demonstrates that the Applicant created the problem he now complains about.\n#### AD 7.6 - Financial Impact of Misconduct\n6.3 The Applicant alleges financial impact. The actual financial sabotage included: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) Revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025; (3) Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025 (100% audit data loss, seven days after my confrontation with Ms. Farrar); (4) Card cancellation 7 June 2025; (5) Domain theft 29 May 2025 (regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory, 14 days after my confrontation, Annexure **JF4**); (6) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 (R34.9M operations destroyed).\n#### AD 7.8 - Continuing Harm to Corporations\n6.4 The Applicant claims continuing harm. The harm was systematically inflicted. An email from Gee dated 20 June 2025 states she was instructed to send a \"don't use regima.zone only use regimaskin.co.za\" email (Annexure **JF8**). The domain regimaskin.co.za is owned by Adderory (Pty) Ltd (Ms. Farrar's son's company), not by RegimA. This diverted customers from the Second Respondent's platforms to a competing domain controlled by Ms. Farrar's family.\n#### AD 7.10 - Card Cancellations and Service Interruptions\n6.5 The Applicant claims he cancelled cards in June 2025 \"following\" the accountant's discovery and requested invoices from the Second Respondent. Timeline evidence demonstrates: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent provides comprehensive reports; (2) 7 June: Applicant cancels UK cards (5191, 5225) paying for Shopify subscriptions (Annexure **DF4**); (3) Cards cancelled one day after cooperation, not after any discovery. The cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible (card-based authentication), then the Applicant complained about missing documentation.\n#### AD 7.13 - Domain and Service Halts Due to Card Cancellations\n6.6 The Applicant claims subscriptions were halted due to card cancellations. To prevent business collapse, the Second Respondent substituted his personal card (1927) for RegimA SA and I substituted my personal card (3212) for RegimA Zone (Annexure **JF7**). Meanwhile, the competing domain regimaskin.co.za was actively diverting customers.\n#### AD 7.16 - Son's Interference with Business Operations\n6.7 The Applicant alleges the Second Respondent interfered with operations. The evidence demonstrates the Second Respondent built and managed 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually (Annexure **DF1**). The Second Respondent's partner, Kayla Pretorius, co-built these operations before her murder on 13 July 2023. After Kayla's death, a court order was obtained to seize her email account (kayp@rzo.io), which interfered with a law enforcement investigation that had instructed a freeze on the account (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.18 - Email and Account Access Interference\n6.8 The Applicant claims the Second Respondent restricted email access. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to his own email (pete@regima.com)\u2014controlled by Ms. Farrar; (2) Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 show Ms. Farrar using the Applicant's email (Annexure **SF2**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's; (4) Kayla's email was seized by court order after her murder (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.20 - Continued Interference Not in Corporate Interests\n6.9 The Applicant claims interference is not in corporate interests. The corporate interests were served by the Second Respondent's profitable operations (R34.9M annually). The interference came from: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Domain theft; (6) Warehouse sabotage. Each action occurred after either my debt inquiry (15 May) or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June).\n---\n### 7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 8.4-9.3: FINANCIAL DISCREPANCIES AND MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 8.4 - Discovery of Financial Discrepancies\n7.1 The Applicant claims the accountant discovered discrepancies. The accountant, Mr. Bantjies, is also: (1) Undisclosed trustee; (2) Debtor owing R18.685M; (3) Controller of financial systems; (4) Recipient of the Second Respondent's fraud report on 6 June 2025. Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025. The \"discovery\" occurred after the Second Respondent exposed fraud to the person facilitating it.\n#### AD 8.5 - Accountant's Attendance and Findings\n7.2 The Applicant states Mr. Bantjies attended for provisional tax and VAT submissions. The two years of unallocated expenses (dumped into RegimA Worldwide Distribution on 30 March 2025) occurred while: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled the accounting system using the Applicant's email; (2) Linda (Ms. Farrar's sister) was employed as bookkeeper (Annexure **SF8**); (3) Mr. Bantjies was the accountant. The question arises: why were expenses unallocated for two years if the accountant and bookkeeper were performing their duties?\n#### AD 8.7 - IT Expenses and Tax Problems\n7.3 The Applicant cites IT expenses: 2024 tax year R6,738,007.47; 2025 tax year R2,116,159.47. The Applicant claims these are \"almost entirely unexplainable.\" The context omitted from the founding affidavit is that these expenses supported 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. The IT expenses represent 19.3% of revenue (2024) and 6.1% of revenue (2025)\u2014reasonable for a global e-commerce operation. The Applicant fails to disclose the revenue context.\n#### AD 8.10 - International Expenses and Tax Implications\n7.4 The Applicant claims expenses are \"seemingly international\" and accounts have \"almost exceeded the yearly allowable quota for funds leaving South Africa.\" The Shopify platforms were funded by UK company RegimA Zone Ltd (company 10697009). UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The international expenses were legitimate costs of UK-owned e-commerce operations.\n#### AD 9.2 - Bank Message Regarding International Transfers\n7.5 The Applicant references bank messages about international transfers. The actual international payment flow is demonstrated by Shopify invoices: UK entities (RegimA Zone Ltd) funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The payment direction is UK \u2192 SA, not SA \u2192 UK as the Applicant's affidavit implies.\n#### AD 9.3 - Financial Misconduct Summary\n7.6 The Applicant summarizes alleged misconduct. The documented financial misconduct includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) without the Second Respondent's authority; (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments (Annexure **SF3**, **SF5**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments for this stock (SARS audit email, Annexure **SF4**); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023, unpaid despite Ms. Farrar's false claim to me that it was paid (Annexure **JF2**, **SF6**).\n---\n### 8. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1-10.14: APPLICATION TO DECLARE RESPONDENTS DELINQUENT\n#### AD 10.1 - Relief Sought - Delinquency or Probation\n8.1 The Applicant seeks delinquency or probation orders under Section 162. The evidence establishes grounds for the Applicant's own delinquency: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers in breach of fiduciary duty as co-director; (2) Card cancellation sabotage one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation; (3) False statements about UK payment flows; (4) Abuse of ex parte process through material non-disclosures.\n#### AD 10.3 - Delinquent Conduct of Respondents\n8.2 The Applicant alleges delinquent conduct by the Second Respondent and me. My actual conduct included: (1) Fulfilling fiduciary duty as trustee by investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025); (2) Confronting Ms. Farrar about profiting from proceeds of murder; (3) Being deceived by co-trustees into signing \"Main Trustee\" document (11 Aug 2025, Annexure **JF5**); (4) Being punished with interdict two days later (13 Aug 2025, Annexure **JF6**).\n#### AD 10.4 - Contravention of Companies Act\n8.3 The Applicant alleges Companies Act contraventions. Section 76(3)(b) requires directors to act in good faith and for a proper purpose. The Applicant's actions demonstrate bad faith: (1) Manufactured crisis (card cancellation day after cooperation); (2) Material non-disclosures in ex parte application; (3) False statements about UK operations; (4) Systematic sabotage of profitable businesses.\n#### AD 10.5.2 - Probation Relief Under Section 162\n8.4 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence reveals: Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) commissioned this affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths. Mr. Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery of the fraud the Second Respondent reported.\n#### AD 10.6 - Close Corporations Act - Fiduciary Duties\n8.5 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act fiduciary duties. The Act requires members to manage in the corporation's interest. RegimA Skin Treatments (CC) owes R1,035,000 to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023. Strategic Logistics (CC) lost R5.4M in stock that \"disappeared\"\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory. These transactions were not in the corporations' interests.\n#### AD 10.6.1 - Member's Duty to Manage in Corporation's Interest\n8.6 The Applicant cites duty to manage in corporation's interest. The R5.4M stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics represents 46% of annual sales\u201410 times the historical adjustment. Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments. This transaction was not in Strategic Logistics' interest.\n#### AD 10.6.2 - Member's Duty Not to Exceed Powers\n8.7 The Applicant cites duty not to exceed powers. The unauthorized R900,000 transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) were made without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director. The Applicant exceeded his powers by acting unilaterally.\n#### AD 10.6.3 - Member's Duty to Avoid Conflicts of Interest\n8.8 The Applicant cites duty to avoid conflicts. The evidence reveals multiple conflicts: (1) Mr. Bantjies: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant; (2) Ms. Farrar's son (Adderory) supplying stock to RegimA Skin Treatments while same stock type \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) Villa Via (trust-owned) charging 86% profit margin rent to group; (4) Regimaskin.co.za (owned by Ms. Farrar's son) competing with RegimA operations.\n#### AD 10.7 - Member Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n8.9 The Applicant invokes breach of fiduciary duty liability. The breaches are established: (1) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to the Second Respondent (co-director) by unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries (as trustee) by attacking them with interdict; (3) Mr. Bantjies breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries by dismissing audit request and facilitating fraud.\n#### AD 10.7.1.2 - Liability for Economic Benefit Derived\n8.10 The Applicant cites liability for economic benefit. The economic benefits derived include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (4) 86% profit margin on Villa Via rent; (5) Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za (Adderory).\n#### AD 10.7.1.4 - Liability for Loss Suffered by Corporation\n8.11 The Applicant cites liability for corporate loss. The losses suffered include: (1) RegimA SA: R900K unauthorized transfers, revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025, Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025; (2) RegimA Zone: Customer diversion to competing domain, card cancellation sabotage; (3) Strategic Logistics: R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (4) RegimA Worldwide: Forced to pay 2 years of unallocated expenses from all companies.\n#### AD 10.8 - Disqualification for Misconduct Under Section 47\n8.12 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act Section 47 disqualification. This section applies when a member is guilty of gross negligence or fraud. The R5.4M stock adjustment (46% of sales, 10x historical) in Strategic Logistics, with Ms. Farrar claiming Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments, and the same stock type supplied by Adderory, suggests systematic fraud.\n#### AD 10.8.1 - Declaration of Delinquency as Alternative Relief\n8.13 The Applicant seeks delinquency declaration. The evidence supports declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5): (1) Intentional harm to companies (systematic sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent conduct (card cancellation without notice); (3) Breach of trust (attacking beneficiaries as trustee); (4) Abuse of process (ex parte order based on material non-disclosures and false statements).\n#### AD 10.9 - Mandatory Disqualification Under Section 162(5)\n8.14 The Applicant invokes Section 162(5) mandatory disqualification grounds. These grounds apply to the Applicant's conduct: (1) Intentional harm to companies (R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent harm (card cancellation rendering documentation inaccessible); (3) Breach of trust (trustee attacking beneficiaries).\n#### AD 10.9.2 - Intentional or Grossly Negligent Harm\n8.15 The Applicant alleges intentional or grossly negligent harm by respondents. The intentional harm was inflicted by the Applicant and his co-conspirators: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent cooperates; (2) 7 June: Cards cancelled; (3) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days after my inquiry); (4) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days after my inquiry); (5) 8 July: Warehouse sabotaged; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action followed either my debt inquiry or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure.\n#### AD 10.9.3 - Manner of Acting - Gross Negligence or Misconduct\n8.16 The Applicant alleges gross negligence or misconduct. The gross negligence is demonstrated by: Cancelling 15 business cards without notice, rendering documentation inaccessible, then complaining about missing documentation.

This six-month campaign occurred after I investigated fraud and the Second Respondent exposed fraud.\n#### AD 10.9.3.2 - Acquiescence to Fraudulent Acts\n8.18 The Applicant alleges acquiescence to fraud. The acquiescence to fraud includes: (1) Two years of unallocated expenses while Ms. Farrar controlled systems using the Applicant's email and Linda was employed as bookkeeper; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" with Mr. Bantjies allegedly instructing payments; (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate unpaid since Feb 2023; (4) Villa Via 86% profit margin rent extraction.\n#### AD 10.9.3.3 - Party to Omission with Fraudulent Purpose\n8.19 The Applicant alleges omission with fraudulent purpose.

This section applies when conduct is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) I fulfilled fiduciary duty by investigating debt, then was punished with interdict; (2) Second Respondent exposed fraud to accountant, then suffered six-month sabotage campaign; (3) Both excluded from profitable businesses we built.\n#### AD 10.10.2.3 - Oppressive or Prejudicial Exercise of Powers\n8.21 The Applicant alleges oppressive exercise of powers. The oppressive exercise of powers includes: (1) Applicant used trustee powers to attack beneficiaries; (2) Mr. Bantjies used trustee powers to dismiss audit request and facilitate fraud; (3) Applicant used director powers to make unauthorized R900K transfers; (4) Applicant used court process to obtain ex parte order based on material non-disclosures.\n#### AD 10.10.2.4 - Conduct with Oppressive or Prejudicial Result\n8.22 The Applicant alleges conduct with prejudicial result. The prejudicial results include: (1) I was excluded from companies after investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent excluded from R34.9M operations he built; (3) Customers diverted to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son; (4) R900K transferred without authorization; (5) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (6) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate unpaid.\n#### AD 10.10.22 - Business Conducted in Oppressive Manner\n8.23 The Applicant alleges oppressive business conduct. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled all systems using Applicant's email while claiming to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions; (2) Applicant had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems; (3) Two years of expenses unallocated despite employed bookkeeper; (4) Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) dismissed fraud investigation.\n#### AD 10.10.41 - Conduct Inconsistent with Duties\n8.24 The Applicant alleges conduct inconsistent with duties. The conduct inconsistent with duties includes: (1) Trustee attacking beneficiaries (Applicant, Mr. Bantjies); (2) Director making unauthorized transfers (Applicant); (3) Trustee dismissing fraud investigation (Mr. Bantjies); (4) Accountant facilitating fraud while being debtor (Mr. Bantjies); (5) Administrator controlling systems while diverting revenue (Ms. Farrar).\n#### AD 10.13 - Unaccounted Money - Significant Sums\n8.25 The Applicant alleges unaccounted money. The unaccounted money includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023; (4) R1.73 million transferred 11 Sep 2025; (5) Two years of unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide on 30 Mar 2025.\n#### AD 10.14 - Full Extent of Transgressions Not Yet Determined\n8.26 The Applicant claims full extent not yet determined.

RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 11.2-12.4: UK OPERATIONS AND ALLEGED FRAUD\n#### AD 11.2 - UK Head Office - RegimA UK Ltd\n9.1 The Applicant describes UK operations. RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The UK company is the economic owner of the e-commerce operations.\n#### AD 11.3 - Directors of UK Entity\n9.2 The Applicant describes UK directors. The UK company was established by the Second Respondent and Kayla to own and operate the global e-commerce platforms. After Kayla's murder (13 July 2023), the Second Respondent continued managing the operations.\n#### AD 11.4 - Applicant's Role in Operations\n9.3 The Applicant describes his role. The evidence demonstrates the Applicant had no operational role: (1) No access to email (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (4) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's. The Applicant appears to be a figurehead.\n#### AD 11.6 - UK Branch Operations\n9.4 The Applicant describes UK branch operations. The UK company funded SA operations through Shopify subscription payments. Shopify invoices demonstrate UK \u2192 SA payment flow of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The UK company invested in SA operations, not the reverse.\n#### AD 11.8 - UK Financial Concerns\n9.5 The Applicant expresses UK financial concerns. The financial concerns were manufactured: (1) Card cancellation 7 June 2025 disrupted UK funding; (2) Domain theft 29 May 2025 diverted customers; (3) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 destroyed UK-funded operations; (4) Data expungement 22 May 2025 eliminated audit trail.\n#### AD 12.1 - UK Branch Non-Payment and Fraud Concerns\n9.6 The Applicant alleges UK branch non-payment and fraud. The Shopify invoices prove the opposite: UK entities funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). UK bank transactions corroborate the invoices (Annexure **DF8**). The Applicant's statement is demonstrably false.\n#### AD 12.2 - Misappropriation Leading to Insolvency Risk\n9.7 The Applicant alleges misappropriation leading to insolvency. The actual insolvency risk was created by: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (3) Data expungement (22 May); (4) Card cancellation (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). Despite six months of sabotage, the Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied.\n#### AD 12.3 - Purpose of Court Application\n9.8 The Applicant states the purpose is to prevent further harm. The actual purpose appears to be: (1) Punish me for investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May); (2) Punish Second Respondent for exposing Villa Via fraud (6 June); (3) Seize control of R34.9M operations Second Respondent built; (4) Prevent forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and the systematic fraud.\n#### AD 12.4 - Alternative Roles for Wife and Son\n9.9 The Applicant suggests alternative roles for the Second Respondent and me. The evidence demonstrates: (1) I fulfilled trustee duties by investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent built and managed R34.9M profitable operations; (3) Both were systematically sabotaged after investigating/exposing fraud; (4) Both were attacked with interdict by co-trustees; (5) I was included in interdict two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document.\n---\n### 10. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 13.2-13.8: REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERDICTORY RELIEF\n#### AD 13.2 - Clear Right Not to Be Prejudiced\n10.1 The Applicant claims clear right not to be prejudiced. The Applicant has no clear right: (1) He manufactured the crisis (card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (2) He made unauthorized R900K transfers; (3) He had alternative remedies as trustee with \"additional powers\"; (4) He obtained order through material non-disclosures (Mr. Bantjies's trustee status, debtor status, timeline manipulation, UK payment flow misrepresentation).\n#### AD 13.2.2 - Injury Sustained and Apprehension of Further Harm\n10.2 The Applicant claims injury and apprehension of harm. The Applicant suffered no injury he didn't inflict on himself: (1) Card cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible; (2) Unauthorized transfers depleted accounts; (3) Revenue diversions reduced cash flow; (4) Warehouse sabotage destroyed operations. The apprehension of further harm was manufactured to justify ex parte relief.\n#### AD 13.3 - Reasonable Apprehension of Irreparable Harm\n10.3 The Applicant claims reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm. The irreparable harm was inflicted by the Applicant's six-month sabotage campaign: (1) R34.9M operations destroyed (93.3% revenue collapse); (2) Customer relationships diverted to competing domain; (3) Audit data expunged (100% loss); (4) Documentation rendered inaccessible; (5) Accounts emptied. The Second Respondent and I suffered irreparable harm, not the Applicant.\n#### AD 13.4 - Interdicts Essential for Corporation Survival\n10.4 The Applicant claims interdicts essential for survival. The corporations were profitable under the Second Respondent's management (R34.9M annually). The survival threat came from the Applicant's sabotage: (1) Unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data destruction; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Excluding the Second Respondent and me threatened survival, not ensured it.\n#### AD 13.5 - Balance of Convenience Favours Granting Relief\n10.5 The Applicant claims balance of convenience favors relief. The balance overwhelmingly favors the Second Respondent and me: (1) We built and managed profitable operations; (2) We investigated and exposed fraud; (3) We were systematically sabotaged for doing so; (4) We substituted personal cards to prevent business collapse; (5) We support independent forensic audit. The Applicant obtained relief through material non-disclosures and false statements.\n#### AD 13.8 - Other Relief Sought in Part A\n10.6 The Applicant seeks additional relief. The relief was obtained ex parte based on: (1) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Omitting timeline showing card cancellation day after cooperation; (4) Falsely claiming UK owes SA (opposite is true); (5) Omitting R34.9M revenue context; (6) Omitting my debt inquiry and retaliation pattern.\n---\n### 11. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1-14.5: FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND FORENSIC AUDIT\n#### AD 14.1 - Financial Constraints on Respondents\n11.1 The Applicant seeks financial constraints on the Second Respondent and me. The financial constraints were already imposed through sabotage: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Despite six months of sabotage, the Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors.\n#### AD 14.3 - Constraint to Prevent Financial Prejudice\n11.2 The Applicant seeks constraints to prevent prejudice. The prejudice was inflicted by the Applicant: (1) RegimA SA account opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 (Feb-Mar 2025); (2) 169 customer deposits R566,598.57 proving active trade; (3) R1.73M transferred 11 Sep 2025; (4) R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage.\n#### AD 14.4 - Forensic Audit Necessity and Remuneration\n11.3 The Applicant seeks forensic audit. The Second Respondent and I support independent forensic audit by an impartial party. Such audit would reveal: (1) Mr. Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant); (2) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme (Strategic Logistics \u2192 Adderory \u2192 RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (4) Two years unallocated expenses; (5) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (6) Revenue diversion scheme; (7) Ms. Farrar's control of systems using Applicant's email.\n#### AD 14.5 - Request for Relief Under Part B\n11.4 The Applicant requests Part B relief. The relief should include: (1) Setting aside ex parte order obtained through material non-disclosures; (2) Independent forensic audit; (3) Investigation of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts; (4) Investigation of R5.4M stock \"disappearance\"; (5) Recovery of R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (6) Investigation of Ms. Farrar's control and Adderory's role; (7) Consideration of Applicant's delinquency under Section 162(5).\n---\n### 12. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1-16.12: DISCOVERY AND URGENCY\n#### AD 16.1 - Discovery of Respondents' Conduct\n12.1 The Applicant claims discovery of conduct in mid-June 2025. The actual discovery timeline: (1) 15 May: I discovered R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (2) 6 June: Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies; (3) 7 June: Applicant cancelled cards (day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (4) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed audit request. The Applicant's \"discovery\" was actually consciousness of guilt after the Second Respondent exposed fraud to Mr. Bantjies.\n#### AD 16.2 - R600,000 Transfer as Trigger for Action\n12.2 The Applicant cites R600,000 transfer (later corrected to R500,000) as trigger. The actual triggers were: (1) 15 May: I confronted Ms. Farrar about R1,035,000 debt and \"profiting from proceeds of murder\"; (2) 6 June: Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed audit request. The R500,000 transfer is a pretext.\n#### AD 16.5 - Unawareness of Urgent Application Process\n12.3 The Applicant claims unawareness of urgent process. The Applicant had access to legal advice and Mr. Bantjies as Commissioner of Oaths. The delay from mid-June to August contradicts urgency. The actual urgency appears to be preventing forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and systematic fraud.\n#### AD 16.6 - Delay Would Have Been Avoided\n12.4 The Applicant claims delay would have been avoided if he knew the process. The two-month delay (mid-June to August) contradicts urgency. The timing suggests: (1) Waiting to see if Second Respondent's audit request would proceed; (2) Coordinating with Mr. Bantjies (who dismissed audit request 10 June); (3) Preparing my punishment (included in interdict 13 Aug, two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document 11 Aug).\n#### AD 16.8 - State of Shock and Delayed Response\n12.5 The Applicant claims state of shock. The Applicant was not in shock\u2014he was executing a systematic sabotage campaign: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping; (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 7 Jun: Card cancellation; (6) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (7) 11 Sep: Account emptying. This is not shock\u2014this is systematic execution.\n#### AD 16.10 - Attorney Consultation Timeline\n12.6 The Applicant describes attorney consultation. The consultation occurred after: (1) My debt inquiry (15 May); (2) Data expungement (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June); (5) Card cancellation (7 June); (6) Mr. Bantjies's audit dismissal (10 June). The legal action was retaliation, not discovery.\n#### AD 16.12 - Need for Urgent Court Assistance\n12.7 The Applicant claims need for urgent assistance. The Applicant had alternative remedies: (1) Trustee with \"additional powers\" as Founder; (2) Could have conducted audit as trustee; (3) Could have consulted with co-trustee (me) instead of attacking me; (4) Could have consulted with co-trustee Mr. Bantjies (who was facilitating the fraud). The Applicant chose ex parte process to avoid disclosure of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and systematic sabotage.\n---\n### 13. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 17.3-17.4: EX PARTE BASIS\n#### AD 17.3 - Ex Parte Basis for Application\n13.1 The Applicant justifies ex parte application. The ex parte process was abused through material non-disclosures: (1) Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Timeline manipulation (card cancellation day after cooperation); (4) UK payment flow misrepresentation (claimed SA \u2192 UK, actually UK \u2192 SA); (5) R34.9M revenue context omission; (6) My debt inquiry and retaliation pattern; (7) Second Respondent's fraud exposure and retaliation pattern; (8) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email; (9) Adderory's competing domain; (10) R5.4M stock \"disappearance.\"\n#### AD 17.4 - Urgency Justifies Ex Parte Relief\n13.2 The Applicant claims urgency justifies ex parte relief. The urgency was manufactured: (1) Two-month delay contradicts urgency; (2) Card cancellation day after cooperation shows consciousness of guilt; (3) Systematic sabotage from Feb-Sep shows premeditation; (4) I was included two days after signing document, showing coordination; (5) Alternative remedies available as trustee. The ex parte relief was obtained to prevent the Second Respondent and me from exposing the material non-disclosures and systematic fraud.\n---\n### 14. RESPONSE TO REMAINING AD PARAGRAPHS (18.3, 20, 22, 40.9.4, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, 88)\n#### AD 18.3 - Continual Unauthorized Fund Transfers\n14.1 The Applicant alleges continual unauthorized transfers. The unauthorized transfers were made by the Applicant: R450,000 on 14 Feb 2025 + R450,000 on 15 Feb 2025 = R900,000 total from RegimA SA without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director. RegimA SA account: opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 within one month despite 169 customer deposits R566,598.57.\n#### AD 20 - First and Second Respondent Details\n14.2 The Applicant provides the Second Respondent's and my details.

The gross abuse includes: (1) Applicant made R900K unauthorized transfers as director; (2) Applicant cancelled cards without notice as director; (3) Applicant used trustee position to attack beneficiaries; (4) Mr. Bantjies used trustee position to dismiss audit and facilitate fraud; (5) Ms. Farrar used administrative position to control systems, divert revenue, and facilitate son's competing domain.\n#### AD 44 - Applicant Identity Details\n14.5 The Applicant confirms identity. The Applicant's actual position: (1) No access to email (pete@regima.com controlled by Ms. Farrar); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (4) Debtor to Mr. Bantjies (R18.685M due May 2026); (5) Figurehead while Ms. Farrar claims to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions.\n#### AD 50 - Registered Address Details\n14.6 The Applicant provides address: 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview. This is also my address. The Applicant attacked me (co-trustee, beneficiary) with interdict two days after I signed \"Main Trustee\" document, punishing me for investigating R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate and supporting the Second Respondent.\n#### AD 74 - Timeline Context\n14.7 The Applicant provides timeline context. The actual timeline: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping (12-hour deadline); (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 15 May: My debt inquiry; (6) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days later); (7) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days later); (8) 6 Jun: Second Respondent's fraud exposure; (9) 7 Jun: Cards cancelled (1 day later); (10) 10 Jun: Audit dismissed; (11) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotaged; (12) 11 Aug: I sign document; (13) 13 Aug: I included in interdict (2 days later); (14) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied.\n#### AD 78 - Accountant's Office Visit and Discovery\n14.8 The Applicant describes Mr. Bantjies's office visit. The visit occurred after: (1) Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025; (2) Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) Applicant cancelled cards on 7 June 2025 (day after Second Respondent's cooperation). Mr. Bantjies \"discovered\" irregularities after the Second Respondent reported fraud to him. Mr. Bantjies then dismissed audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\"\n#### AD 83 - Irregular Payments Discovery\n14.9 The Applicant describes discovery of irregular payments. The irregular payments include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers by Applicant (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics (same type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments (SARS audit email); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023 (Ms. Farrar falsely claimed paid to me on 15 May 2025).\n#### AD 88 - Follow-up Actions\n14.10 The Applicant describes follow-up actions. The follow-up actions include: (1) 7 Jun: Card cancellation (day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (2) 10 Jun: Mr. Bantjies dismisses audit; (3) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (4) 11 Aug: I was deceived into signing document; (5) 13 Aug: I was included in interdict; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action was retaliation against me (15 May debt inquiry) and the Second Respondent (6 Jun fraud exposure).\n---\n### 15. PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n15.1 I respectfully request that this Honourable Court:\n15.1.1 Set aside the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025 on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n15.1.2 Dismiss the Applicant's application for delinquency or probation orders against the Second Respondent and me.\n15.1.3 Grant a counter-application declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008, on the grounds of:\n- Intentional harm to companies through systematic sabotage;\n- Grossly negligent conduct in card cancellation without notice;\n- Breach of fiduciary duty to beneficiaries as trustee;\n- Abuse of court process through material non-disclosures and false statements.\n15.1.4 Order an independent forensic audit by an impartial auditor to investigate:\n- Mr. Bantjies's conflicts of interest (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant);\n- R5.4 million stock transfer pricing scheme;\n- R1,035,000 debt to Kayla Pretorius's estate;\n- Two years of unallocated expenses;\n- Unauthorized R900,000 transfers;\n- Revenue diversion scheme;\n- Ms. Farrar's control of systems and Adderory's role.\n15.1.5 Order the Applicant to pay the costs of this application on the scale as between attorney and client.\n15.1.6 Grant such further and/or alternative relief as this Honourable Court deems fit.\n---\n### 16. CONCLUSION\n16.1 The evidence presented in this affidavit demonstrates that I fulfilled my fiduciary duties as a trustee by investigating a substantial debt owed to a deceased beneficiary's estate. I confronted Ms. Farrar about this debt on 15 May 2025, stating that keeping the funds would constitute profiting from the proceeds of murder.\n16.2 Within seven days of my inquiry, Shopify data was expunged, eliminating the audit trail. Within 14 days, a competing domain was registered by Ms. Farrar's son's company, diverting customers from the Second Respondent's operations.\n16.3 On 11 August 2025, I was deceived by my co-trustees into signing a \"Main Trustee\" document that backdated the Applicant's designation to 1 July 2025. Two days later, on 13 August 2025, the Applicant and Mr. Bantjies included me in this interdict.\n16.4 The ex parte order was obtained through material non-disclosures, including Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status, his R18.685 million debt to the trust, the timeline showing card cancellation one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation, false statements about UK payment flows, and the omission of the R34.9 million revenue context.\n16.5 The Second Respondent and I support an independent forensic audit by an impartial party. Such an audit would reveal the systematic fraud, conflicts of interest, and abuse of process that underlie this application.\n16.6 I respectfully submit that the balance of convenience overwhelmingly favors setting aside the ex parte order and granting the relief sought in this affidavit.\n---\n**SIGNED at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025.**\n---\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**  \nFirst Respondent\n---\n**THUS SIGNED AND SWORN TO before me at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025, the Deponent having acknowledged that she knows and understands the contents of this Affidavit, that she has no objection to taking the prescribed oath, and that she considers the oath to be binding on her conscience.**\n---\n**COMMISSIONER OF OATHS**\n---\n## LIST OF ANNEXURES\n**JF1:** Trust deed and trustee documentation  \n**JF2:** Email correspondence re R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025)  \n**JF3:** Rynette's false statement documentation  \n**JF4:** Domain registration records (regimaskin.co.za, 29 May 2025)  \n**JF5:** \"Main Trustee\" document (signed 11 Aug 2025, backdated to 1 July 2025)  \n**JF6:** Interdict order (13 Aug 2025)  \n**JF7:** Personal card statements (substitution to prevent collapse)  \n**JF8:** Email from Gee re domain diversion (20 June 2025)\n**DF1:** Shopify operations overview (51+ stores, R34.9M revenue)  \n**DF2:** Villa Via fraud analysis (86% profit margin)  \n**DF3:** Email correspondence with Bantjies (6 June 2025)  \n**DF4:** Card cancellation records (7 June 2025)  \n**DF5-DF7:** Shopify invoices (UK \u2192 SA payment flow, R84,661+ annually)  \n**DF8:** UK bank transactions (corroborating Shopify payments)  \n**DF9:** Unauthorized transfer records (R450K + R450K = R900K, 14-15 Feb 2025)  \n**DF10:** RegimA SA account statements (opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08)  \n**DF11:** Customer deposit records (169 deposits, R566,598.57)  \n**DF12:** Revenue diversion documentation (1 Mar, 14 Apr, 11 Sep 2025)  \n**DF13:** Warehouse sabotage instruction (8 July 2025)  \n**DF14:** Expense dumping documentation (30 Mar 2025)\n**SF1:** Bantjies debt documentation (R18.685M, investment payout schedule)  \n**SF2:** Sage screenshots (Rynette using pete@regima.com, June & Aug 2025)  \n**SF3:** Strategic Logistics R5.4M stock adjustment documentation  \n**SF4:** SARS audit email (Rynette claiming Bantjies instructed payments)  \n**SF5:** Adderory company registration and stock supply documentation  \n**SF6:** Kayla Pretorius estate documentation (R1,035,000 debt)  \n**SF7:** Court order seizing Kayla's email account  \n**SF8:** Linda employment records (bookkeeper)\n---\n**END OF AFFIDAVIT**",

manufactured crisis\n- Section 76(3)(b) of Companies Act - bad faith and improper purpose\n- Section 162(5) of Companies Act - grounds for Peter's delinquency\n- Section 9(1) of Trust Property Control Act - trustee duties\n- Requirements for interdictory relief (clear right, harm, balance of convenience)\n### Strategic Recommendations\n- Emphasize manufactured crisis argument\n- Highlight retaliation pattern\n- Leverage Shopify invoice evidence for perjury\n- Support independent forensic audit\n- Pursue counter-application for Peter's delinquency\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nSent: Saturday, 01 November 2025 14:30\nTo: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.com>; Daniel Faucitt <d@rzo.io>; regizone <regizone@proton.me>\nSubject: AD NOTES - JACQUELINE FAUCITT \n## ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT: JACQUELINE FAUCITT\n**IN THE HIGH COURT OF SOUTH AFRICA**  \n**GAUTENG DIVISION, PRETORIA**\n**Case No:** 2025-137857\n**In the matter between:**\n**PETER ANDREW FAUCITT** \u2014 Applicant\nand\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT** \u2014 First Respondent  \n**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT** \u2014 Second Respondent  \n*(and others)*\n---\n## I, THE UNDERSIGNED\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**\ndo hereby make oath and state that:\n---\n### 1. INTRODUCTION AND CAPACITY\n1.1 I am the First Respondent in this matter, an adult female, and a South African citizen residing at 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview.\n1.2 I am a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust (IT 3651/2013) and a Beneficiary of the same trust. I am also a co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (2017/087935/07) and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (2011/005722/07), both of which are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust.\n1.3 The facts deposed to in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and belief, save where the context indicates otherwise, and are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\n1.4 Where I make legal submissions, I do so on the advice of my legal representatives.\n---\n### 2. PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT\n2.1 This affidavit is filed in response to the Applicant's founding affidavit and the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025.\n2.2 I oppose the relief sought by the Applicant and seek to have the ex parte order set aside on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n2.3 I address each of the Applicant's allegations in the order they appear in the founding affidavit, following the AD paragraph sequence.\n---\n### 3. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 1-3.13: PARTIES AND STRUCTURE\n#### AD 1 - Director Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n3.1 The Applicant invokes provisions relating to director liability for breach of fiduciary duty. I note that the accounting system used to track the alleged breaches was controlled by Rynette Farrar using the Applicant's email address (pete@regima.com), as evidenced by Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 (Annexure **SF2**). The Applicant himself had no access to this system.\n#### AD 1.3 - Applicant's Personal Details and Declaration\n3.2 The Applicant's personal details are noted. I observe that this affidavit was commissioned by Danie Jacobus Bantjies, identified as \"our accountant.\" The full extent of Mr. Bantjies's roles will become apparent through the evidence presented herein.\n#### AD 2 - Company Business Conduct Requirements\n3.3 The Applicant alleges reckless or grossly negligent business conduct. The financial performance of the companies demonstrates the contrary. The Second Respondent and his late partner, Kayla Pretorius, built 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. RegimA SA operates 25 stores with R8.5 million turnover, while RegimA Zone operates 26 stores with R26.4 million turnover. The businesses were highly profitable under the Second Respondent's management.\n#### AD 2.4 - Parties to the Application - Introduction\n3.4 The Applicant introduces the parties. The corporate structure reveals that certain entities are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust, which has three trustees. Two are identified in the founding affidavit: the Applicant and myself. The third trustee's identity was not disclosed to the beneficiaries until recently.\n#### AD 3 - Court Order for Probation of Directors/Members\n3.5 The Applicant seeks probation orders under Section 162 of the Companies Act. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence will demonstrate that the accountant who allegedly \"discovered\" the irregularities has multiple undisclosed roles that create impermissible conflicts.\n#### AD 3.2 - Respondents - Wife\n3.6 I am correctly identified as the Applicant's wife and First Respondent. On 15 May 2025, I confronted Rynette Farrar regarding a debt of R1,035,000 owed by RegimA Skin Treatments CC to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd since February 2023 (Annexure **JF2**). These funds were part of Kayla Pretorius's estate. I informed Ms. Farrar that keeping these funds would constitute profiting from the proceeds of murder. This confrontation proved significant in the events that followed.\n#### AD 3.4 - Respondents - Son\n3.7 The Second Respondent is correctly identified as the Applicant's son. On 6 June 2025, the Second Respondent cooperated with the Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports to the accountant regarding Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC, which is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust (Annexure **DF3**). The Second Respondent unknowingly reported fraud to one of the perpetrators.\n#### AD 3.4.2 - Third Respondent - RegimA Skin Treatments\n3.8 RegimA Skin Treatments CC (B1992/005371/23) owes R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, part of Kayla Pretorius's estate, since February 2023. When I raised this debt on 15 May 2025, Ms. Farrar claimed it was paid\u2014a statement I have since determined to be false. RegimA Skin Treatments receives stock from Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure **SF5**).\n#### AD 3.6 - Fourth Respondent - Regim A UK\n3.9 RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). This contradicts claims made later in the founding affidavit regarding UK entities owing money to SA operations.\n#### AD 3.6.1 - Fifth Respondent - Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC\n3.10 Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC (1996/004451/23) is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. Financial analysis reveals an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group\u2014an excessive profit extraction (Annexure **DF2**). This was the fraud the Second Respondent reported to the accountant on 6 June 2025.\n#### AD 3.6.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Villa Via Arcadia\n3.11 Property registration confirms trust ownership. The trust has three trustees, but only two were known to the beneficiaries at the time of this application.\n#### AD 3.7 - Sixth Respondent - Strategic Logistics CC\n3.12 Strategic Logistics CC (2008/136496/23) experienced a R5.4 million stock adjustment in 2024\u2014stock that allegedly \"just disappeared\" (Annexure **SF3**). This represents 46% of annual sales (R5.4M on R11.3M sales) and is 10 times the prior year's adjustment. The stock type matches inventory supplied by Adderory (Pty) Ltd to RegimA Skin Treatments.\n#### AD 3.7.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Strategic Logistics\n3.13 Property registration documents are noted. In a SARS audit email concerning the R5.4M stock adjustment, Ms. Farrar claimed that Danie Bantjies instructed her to make the substantial payments related to this transaction (Annexure **SF4**).\n#### AD 3.8 - Seventh Respondent - FirstRand Bank (FNB)\n3.14 FNB holds accounts for the companies. On 14 and 15 February 2025, unauthorized transfers of R450,000 each (R900,000 total) were made from RegimA SA's FNB account without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director (Annexure **DF9**). The account opened with R997,597.94 and closed at R5,284.08 within one month, despite 169 customer deposits totaling R566,598.57 proving active trade (Annexure **DF10**, **DF11**).\n#### AD 3.9 - Eighth and Ninth Respondents\n3.15 ABSA Bank and CIPC are cited. Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution began with an ABSA bank letter dated 14 April 2025 (Annexure **DF12**).\n#### AD 3.11 - Reference to Respondents as Wife and Son\n3.16 The Applicant refers to the Second Respondent and me as \"my wife\" and \"my son.\" Both of us are beneficiaries of the Faucitt Family Trust. I am also a co-trustee. The Trust Property Control Act, 57 of 1988, Section 9(1) requires trustees to act with care, diligence, and skill in the interests of beneficiaries.\n#### AD 3.13 - Court Jurisdiction and Identity Confirmation\n3.17 Jurisdiction is confirmed. The affidavit was commissioned by Danie Bantjies, who signed as \"Commissioner of Oaths.\" Mr. Bantjies's accounting firm is \"Bantjes and Company.\" His full relationship to the trust and companies will be revealed through the evidence presented herein.\n---\n### 4. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTANT DETAILS - BANTJIES CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n#### AD 4 - Accountant Details - Bantjes and Company\n4.1 The Applicant identifies \"our accountant\" as Danie Jacobus Bantjies of \"Bantjes and Company,\" who attended the office in mid-June 2025. What the Applicant does not disclose are the following material facts:\n4.1.1 Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust\u2014a status that was unknown to the beneficiaries, the Second Respondent and myself, until recently.\n4.1.2 Mr. Bantjies is a debtor to the trust, owing R18.685 million on an investment payout schedule with payments due in May 2026, May 2027, and May 2029 (Annexure **SF1**).\n4.1.3 Mr. Bantjies controls the financial systems and gave instructions to Ms. Farrar for multi-million rand transactions, as evidenced by emails (Annexure **SF4**).\n4.1.4 Mr. Bantjies was \"running the companies\" when the Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud on 6 June 2025.\n4.1.5 Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\"\n4.2 This creates an impermissible conflict of interest: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant + Company Controller. Mr. Bantjies had a direct financial interest in preventing discovery of the fraud the Second Respondent reported.\n---\n### 5. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1-6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE\n#### AD 6.1 - Relationships Between Parties\n5.1 The Applicant describes family and corporate relationships. The evidence demonstrates a different control structure. Ms. Farrar controlled all bank accounts (the Applicant had no access), controlled the Sage accounting system using the Applicant's email (pete@regima.com), and claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions rather than the Applicant's (Annexure **SF2**). Ms. Farrar's sister, Linda, was employed as bookkeeper, yet two years of expenses remained unallocated until 30 March 2025 (Annexure **SF8**).\n#### AD 6.3 - Directors and Members of Respondent Entities\n5.2 The Applicant describes directorships. The Second Respondent and I are co-directors of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd. RegimA Worldwide Distribution is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. On 30 March 2025, Ms. Farrar and the Applicant dumped two years of unallocated expenses into RegimA Worldwide Distribution and demanded the Second Respondent sign off within 12 hours for SARS VAT and Annual Accounts (Annexure **DF14**). The Second Respondent used this deadline extension (until 6 June) to finalize reports and uncover the Villa Via fraud.\n#### AD 6.5 - Banking and Registration of Respondent Entities\n5.3 The Applicant describes banking arrangements. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to any bank accounts; (2) Ms. Farrar controlled all accounts; (3) Revenue diversion for RegimA SA started 1 March 2025; (4) Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution started 14 April 2025 (ABSA bank letter); (5) On 11 September 2025, R1.73 million was transferred from accounts (Annexure **DF12**).\n---\n### 6. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7-7.20: URGENCY AND ALLEGED MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 7 - Urgency and Delay Considerations\n6.1 The Applicant claims urgency. The timeline reveals: (1) Alleged discovery mid-June 2025; (2) Application filed August 2025; (3) Two-month delay contradicts urgency. The actual urgency relates to the Second Respondent's fraud exposure on 6 June and my debt inquiry on 15 May.\n#### AD 7.3 - Urgency Details\n6.2 The Applicant claims the accountant noted \"numerous discrepancies\" and \"irregular payments\" in mid-June 2025. Timeline analysis reveals: 6 June 2025 (Second Respondent provides comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies), 7 June 2025 (Applicant cancels 15 UK business cards without notice). The card cancellation occurred one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation, not \"following\" any discovery. This demonstrates that the Applicant created the problem he now complains about.\n#### AD 7.6 - Financial Impact of Misconduct\n6.3 The Applicant alleges financial impact. The actual financial sabotage included: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) Revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025; (3) Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025 (100% audit data loss, seven days after my confrontation with Ms. Farrar); (4) Card cancellation 7 June 2025; (5) Domain theft 29 May 2025 (regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory, 14 days after my confrontation, Annexure **JF4**); (6) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 (R34.9M operations destroyed).\n#### AD 7.8 - Continuing Harm to Corporations\n6.4 The Applicant claims continuing harm. The harm was systematically inflicted. An email from Gee dated 20 June 2025 states she was instructed to send a \"don't use regima.zone only use regimaskin.co.za\" email (Annexure **JF8**). The domain regimaskin.co.za is owned by Adderory (Pty) Ltd (Ms. Farrar's son's company), not by RegimA. This diverted customers from the Second Respondent's platforms to a competing domain controlled by Ms. Farrar's family.\n#### AD 7.10 - Card Cancellations and Service Interruptions\n6.5 The Applicant claims he cancelled cards in June 2025 \"following\" the accountant's discovery and requested invoices from the Second Respondent. Timeline evidence demonstrates: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent provides comprehensive reports; (2) 7 June: Applicant cancels UK cards (5191, 5225) paying for Shopify subscriptions (Annexure **DF4**); (3) Cards cancelled one day after cooperation, not after any discovery. The cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible (card-based authentication), then the Applicant complained about missing documentation.\n#### AD 7.13 - Domain and Service Halts Due to Card Cancellations\n6.6 The Applicant claims subscriptions were halted due to card cancellations. To prevent business collapse, the Second Respondent substituted his personal card (1927) for RegimA SA and I substituted my personal card (3212) for RegimA Zone (Annexure **JF7**). Meanwhile, the competing domain regimaskin.co.za was actively diverting customers.\n#### AD 7.16 - Son's Interference with Business Operations\n6.7 The Applicant alleges the Second Respondent interfered with operations. The evidence demonstrates the Second Respondent built and managed 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually (Annexure **DF1**). The Second Respondent's partner, Kayla Pretorius, co-built these operations before her murder on 13 July 2023. After Kayla's death, a court order was obtained to seize her email account (kayp@rzo.io), which interfered with a law enforcement investigation that had instructed a freeze on the account (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.18 - Email and Account Access Interference\n6.8 The Applicant claims the Second Respondent restricted email access. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to his own email (pete@regima.com)\u2014controlled by Ms. Farrar; (2) Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 show Ms. Farrar using the Applicant's email (Annexure **SF2**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's; (4) Kayla's email was seized by court order after her murder (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.20 - Continued Interference Not in Corporate Interests\n6.9 The Applicant claims interference is not in corporate interests. The corporate interests were served by the Second Respondent's profitable operations (R34.9M annually). The interference came from: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Domain theft; (6) Warehouse sabotage. Each action occurred after either my debt inquiry (15 May) or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June).\n---\n### 7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 8.4-9.3: FINANCIAL DISCREPANCIES AND MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 8.4 - Discovery of Financial Discrepancies\n7.1 The Applicant claims the accountant discovered discrepancies. The accountant, Mr. Bantjies, is also: (1) Undisclosed trustee; (2) Debtor owing R18.685M; (3) Controller of financial systems; (4) Recipient of the Second Respondent's fraud report on 6 June 2025. Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025. The \"discovery\" occurred after the Second Respondent exposed fraud to the person facilitating it.\n#### AD 8.5 - Accountant's Attendance and Findings\n7.2 The Applicant states Mr. Bantjies attended for provisional tax and VAT submissions. The two years of unallocated expenses (dumped into RegimA Worldwide Distribution on 30 March 2025) occurred while: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled the accounting system using the Applicant's email; (2) Linda (Ms. Farrar's sister) was employed as bookkeeper (Annexure **SF8**); (3) Mr. Bantjies was the accountant. The question arises: why were expenses unallocated for two years if the accountant and bookkeeper were performing their duties?\n#### AD 8.7 - IT Expenses and Tax Problems\n7.3 The Applicant cites IT expenses: 2024 tax year R6,738,007.47; 2025 tax year R2,116,159.47. The Applicant claims these are \"almost entirely unexplainable.\" The context omitted from the founding affidavit is that these expenses supported 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. The IT expenses represent 19.3% of revenue (2024) and 6.1% of revenue (2025)\u2014reasonable for a global e-commerce operation. The Applicant fails to disclose the revenue context.\n#### AD 8.10 - International Expenses and Tax Implications\n7.4 The Applicant claims expenses are \"seemingly international\" and accounts have \"almost exceeded the yearly allowable quota for funds leaving South Africa.\" The Shopify platforms were funded by UK company RegimA Zone Ltd (company 10697009). UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The international expenses were legitimate costs of UK-owned e-commerce operations.\n#### AD 9.2 - Bank Message Regarding International Transfers\n7.5 The Applicant references bank messages about international transfers. The actual international payment flow is demonstrated by Shopify invoices: UK entities (RegimA Zone Ltd) funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The payment direction is UK \u2192 SA, not SA \u2192 UK as the Applicant's affidavit implies.\n#### AD 9.3 - Financial Misconduct Summary\n7.6 The Applicant summarizes alleged misconduct. The documented financial misconduct includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) without the Second Respondent's authority; (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments (Annexure **SF3**, **SF5**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments for this stock (SARS audit email, Annexure **SF4**); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023, unpaid despite Ms. Farrar's false claim to me that it was paid (Annexure **JF2**, **SF6**).\n---\n### 8. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1-10.14: APPLICATION TO DECLARE RESPONDENTS DELINQUENT\n#### AD 10.1 - Relief Sought - Delinquency or Probation\n8.1 The Applicant seeks delinquency or probation orders under Section 162. The evidence establishes grounds for the Applicant's own delinquency: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers in breach of fiduciary duty as co-director; (2) Card cancellation sabotage one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation; (3) False statements about UK payment flows; (4) Abuse of ex parte process through material non-disclosures.\n#### AD 10.3 - Delinquent Conduct of Respondents\n8.2 The Applicant alleges delinquent conduct by the Second Respondent and me. My actual conduct included: (1) Fulfilling fiduciary duty as trustee by investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025); (2) Confronting Ms. Farrar about profiting from proceeds of murder; (3) Being deceived by co-trustees into signing \"Main Trustee\" document (11 Aug 2025, Annexure **JF5**); (4) Being punished with interdict two days later (13 Aug 2025, Annexure **JF6**).\n#### AD 10.4 - Contravention of Companies Act\n8.3 The Applicant alleges Companies Act contraventions. Section 76(3)(b) requires directors to act in good faith and for a proper purpose. The Applicant's actions demonstrate bad faith: (1) Manufactured crisis (card cancellation day after cooperation); (2) Material non-disclosures in ex parte application; (3) False statements about UK operations; (4) Systematic sabotage of profitable businesses.\n#### AD 10.5.2 - Probation Relief Under Section 162\n8.4 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence reveals: Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) commissioned this affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths. Mr. Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery of the fraud the Second Respondent reported.\n#### AD 10.6 - Close Corporations Act - Fiduciary Duties\n8.5 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act fiduciary duties. The Act requires members to manage in the corporation's interest. RegimA Skin Treatments (CC) owes R1,035,000 to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023. Strategic Logistics (CC) lost R5.4M in stock that \"disappeared\"\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory. These transactions were not in the corporations' interests.\n#### AD 10.6.1 - Member's Duty to Manage in Corporation's Interest\n8.6 The Applicant cites duty to manage in corporation's interest. The R5.4M stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics represents 46% of annual sales\u201410 times the historical adjustment. Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments. This transaction was not in Strategic Logistics' interest.\n#### AD 10.6.2 - Member's Duty Not to Exceed Powers\n8.7 The Applicant cites duty not to exceed powers. The unauthorized R900,000 transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) were made without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director. The Applicant exceeded his powers by acting unilaterally.\n#### AD 10.6.3 - Member's Duty to Avoid Conflicts of Interest\n8.8 The Applicant cites duty to avoid conflicts. The evidence reveals multiple conflicts: (1) Mr. Bantjies: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant; (2) Ms. Farrar's son (Adderory) supplying stock to RegimA Skin Treatments while same stock type \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) Villa Via (trust-owned) charging 86% profit margin rent to group; (4) Regimaskin.co.za (owned by Ms. Farrar's son) competing with RegimA operations.\n#### AD 10.7 - Member Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n8.9 The Applicant invokes breach of fiduciary duty liability. The breaches are established: (1) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to the Second Respondent (co-director) by unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries (as trustee) by attacking them with interdict; (3) Mr. Bantjies breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries by dismissing audit request and facilitating fraud.\n#### AD 10.7.1.2 - Liability for Economic Benefit Derived\n8.10 The Applicant cites liability for economic benefit. The economic benefits derived include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (4) 86% profit margin on Villa Via rent; (5) Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za (Adderory).\n#### AD 10.7.1.4 - Liability for Loss Suffered by Corporation\n8.11 The Applicant cites liability for corporate loss. The losses suffered include: (1) RegimA SA: R900K unauthorized transfers, revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025, Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025; (2) RegimA Zone: Customer diversion to competing domain, card cancellation sabotage; (3) Strategic Logistics: R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (4) RegimA Worldwide: Forced to pay 2 years of unallocated expenses from all companies.\n#### AD 10.8 - Disqualification for Misconduct Under Section 47\n8.12 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act Section 47 disqualification. This section applies when a member is guilty of gross negligence or fraud. The R5.4M stock adjustment (46% of sales, 10x historical) in Strategic Logistics, with Ms. Farrar claiming Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments, and the same stock type supplied by Adderory, suggests systematic fraud.\n#### AD 10.8.1 - Declaration of Delinquency as Alternative Relief\n8.13 The Applicant seeks delinquency declaration. The evidence supports declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5): (1) Intentional harm to companies (systematic sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent conduct (card cancellation without notice); (3) Breach of trust (attacking beneficiaries as trustee); (4) Abuse of process (ex parte order based on material non-disclosures and false statements).\n#### AD 10.9 - Mandatory Disqualification Under Section 162(5)\n8.14 The Applicant invokes Section 162(5) mandatory disqualification grounds. These grounds apply to the Applicant's conduct: (1) Intentional harm to companies (R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent harm (card cancellation rendering documentation inaccessible); (3) Breach of trust (trustee attacking beneficiaries).\n#### AD 10.9.2 - Intentional or Grossly Negligent Harm\n8.15 The Applicant alleges intentional or grossly negligent harm by respondents. The intentional harm was inflicted by the Applicant and his co-conspirators: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent cooperates; (2) 7 June: Cards cancelled; (3) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days after my inquiry); (4) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days after my inquiry); (5) 8 July: Warehouse sabotaged; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action followed either my debt inquiry or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure.\n#### AD 10.9.3 - Manner of Acting - Gross Negligence or Misconduct\n8.16 The Applicant alleges gross negligence or misconduct. The gross negligence is demonstrated by: Cancelling 15 business cards without notice, rendering documentation inaccessible, then complaining about missing documentation. This demonstrates consciousness of guilt and bad faith.\n#### AD 10.9.3.1 - Gross Negligence or Wilful Misconduct\n8.17 The Applicant alleges wilful misconduct. The wilful misconduct includes: (1) Systematic revenue diversion (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (2) Data destruction (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Card sabotage (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep).

This section applies when conduct is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) I fulfilled fiduciary duty by investigating debt, then was punished with interdict; (2) Second Respondent exposed fraud to accountant, then suffered six-month sabotage campaign; (3) Both excluded from profitable businesses we built.\n#### AD 10.10.2.3 - Oppressive or Prejudicial Exercise of Powers\n8.21 The Applicant alleges oppressive exercise of powers.

The oppressive conduct includes: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled all systems using Applicant's email while claiming to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions; (2) Applicant had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems; (3) Two years of expenses unallocated despite employed bookkeeper; (4) Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) dismissed fraud investigation.\n#### AD 10.10.41 - Conduct Inconsistent with Duties\n8.24 The Applicant alleges conduct inconsistent with duties. The conduct inconsistent with duties includes: (1) Trustee attacking beneficiaries (Applicant, Mr. Bantjies); (2) Director making unauthorized transfers (Applicant); (3) Trustee dismissing fraud investigation (Mr. Bantjies); (4) Accountant facilitating fraud while being debtor (Mr. Bantjies); (5) Administrator controlling systems while diverting revenue (Ms. Farrar).\n#### AD 10.13 - Unaccounted Money - Significant Sums\n8.25 The Applicant alleges unaccounted money. The unaccounted money includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023; (4) R1.73 million transferred 11 Sep 2025; (5) Two years of unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide on 30 Mar 2025.\n#### AD 10.14 - Full Extent of Transgressions Not Yet Determined\n8.26 The Applicant claims full extent not yet determined.

RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 11.2-12.4: UK OPERATIONS AND ALLEGED FRAUD\n#### AD 11.2 - UK Head Office - RegimA UK Ltd\n9.1 The Applicant describes UK operations. RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The UK company is the economic owner of the e-commerce operations.\n#### AD 11.3 - Directors of UK Entity\n9.2 The Applicant describes UK directors. The UK company was established by the Second Respondent and Kayla to own and operate the global e-commerce platforms. After Kayla's murder (13 July 2023), the Second Respondent continued managing the operations.\n#### AD 11.4 - Applicant's Role in Operations\n9.3 The Applicant describes his role. The evidence demonstrates the Applicant had no operational role: (1) No access to email (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (4) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's. The Applicant appears to be a figurehead.\n#### AD 11.6 - UK Branch Operations\n9.4 The Applicant describes UK branch operations. The UK company funded SA operations through Shopify subscription payments. Shopify invoices demonstrate UK \u2192 SA payment flow of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The UK company invested in SA operations, not the reverse.\n#### AD 11.8 - UK Financial Concerns\n9.5 The Applicant expresses UK financial concerns. The financial concerns were manufactured: (1) Card cancellation 7 June 2025 disrupted UK funding; (2) Domain theft 29 May 2025 diverted customers; (3) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 destroyed UK-funded operations; (4) Data expungement 22 May 2025 eliminated audit trail.\n#### AD 12.1 - UK Branch Non-Payment and Fraud Concerns\n9.6 The Applicant alleges UK branch non-payment and fraud. The Shopify invoices prove the opposite: UK entities funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). UK bank transactions corroborate the invoices (Annexure **DF8**). The Applicant's statement is demonstrably false.\n#### AD 12.2 - Misappropriation Leading to Insolvency Risk\n9.7 The Applicant alleges misappropriation leading to insolvency. The actual insolvency risk was created by: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (3) Data expungement (22 May); (4) Card cancellation (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). Despite six months of sabotage, the Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied.\n#### AD 12.3 - Purpose of Court Application\n9.8 The Applicant states the purpose is to prevent further harm. The actual purpose appears to be: (1) Punish me for investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May); (2) Punish Second Respondent for exposing Villa Via fraud (6 June); (3) Seize control of R34.9M operations Second Respondent built; (4) Prevent forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and the systematic fraud.\n#### AD 12.4 - Alternative Roles for Wife and Son\n9.9 The Applicant suggests alternative roles for the Second Respondent and me. The evidence demonstrates: (1) I fulfilled trustee duties by investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent built and managed R34.9M profitable operations; (3) Both were systematically sabotaged after investigating/exposing fraud; (4) Both were attacked with interdict by co-trustees; (5) I was included in interdict two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document.\n---\n### 10. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 13.2-13.8: REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERDICTORY RELIEF\n#### AD 13.2 - Clear Right Not to Be Prejudiced\n10.1 The Applicant claims clear right not to be prejudiced. The Applicant has no clear right: (1) He manufactured the crisis (card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (2) He made unauthorized R900K transfers; (3) He had alternative remedies as trustee with \"additional powers\"; (4) He obtained order through material non-disclosures (Mr. Bantjies's trustee status, debtor status, timeline manipulation, UK payment flow misrepresentation).\n#### AD 13.2.2 - Injury Sustained and Apprehension of Further Harm\n10.2 The Applicant claims injury and apprehension of harm. The Applicant suffered no injury he didn't inflict on himself: (1) Card cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible; (2) Unauthorized transfers depleted accounts; (3) Revenue diversions reduced cash flow; (4) Warehouse sabotage destroyed operations. The apprehension of further harm was manufactured to justify ex parte relief.\n#### AD 13.3 - Reasonable Apprehension of Irreparable Harm\n10.3 The Applicant claims reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm. The irreparable harm was inflicted by the Applicant's six-month sabotage campaign: (1) R34.9M operations destroyed (93.3% revenue collapse); (2) Customer relationships diverted to competing domain; (3) Audit data expunged (100% loss); (4) Documentation rendered inaccessible; (5) Accounts emptied. The Second Respondent and I suffered irreparable harm, not the Applicant.\n#### AD 13.4 - Interdicts Essential for Corporation Survival\n10.4 The Applicant claims interdicts essential for survival. The corporations were profitable under the Second Respondent's management (R34.9M annually). The survival threat came from the Applicant's sabotage: (1) Unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data destruction; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Excluding the Second Respondent and me threatened survival, not ensured it.\n#### AD 13.5 - Balance of Convenience Favours Granting Relief\n10.5 The Applicant claims balance of convenience favors relief. The balance overwhelmingly favors the Second Respondent and me: (1) We built and managed profitable operations; (2) We investigated and exposed fraud; (3) We were systematically sabotaged for doing so; (4) We substituted personal cards to prevent business collapse; (5) We support independent forensic audit. The Applicant obtained relief through material non-disclosures and false statements.\n#### AD 13.8 - Other Relief Sought in Part A\n10.6 The Applicant seeks additional relief. The relief was obtained ex parte based on: (1) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Omitting timeline showing card cancellation day after cooperation; (4) Falsely claiming UK owes SA (opposite is true); (5) Omitting R34.9M revenue context; (6) Omitting my debt inquiry and retaliation pattern.\n---\n### 11. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1-14.5: FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND FORENSIC AUDIT\n#### AD 14.1 - Financial Constraints on Respondents\n11.1 The Applicant seeks financial constraints on the Second Respondent and me. The financial constraints were already imposed through sabotage: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Despite six months of sabotage, the Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors.\n#### AD 14.3 - Constraint to Prevent Financial Prejudice\n11.2 The Applicant seeks constraints to prevent prejudice. The prejudice was inflicted by the Applicant: (1) RegimA SA account opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 (Feb-Mar 2025); (2) 169 customer deposits R566,598.57 proving active trade; (3) R1.73M transferred 11 Sep 2025; (4) R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage.\n#### AD 14.4 - Forensic Audit Necessity and Remuneration\n11.3 The Applicant seeks forensic audit. The Second Respondent and I support independent forensic audit by an impartial party. Such audit would reveal: (1) Mr. Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant); (2) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme (Strategic Logistics \u2192 Adderory \u2192 RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (4) Two years unallocated expenses; (5) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (6) Revenue diversion scheme; (7) Ms. Farrar's control of systems using Applicant's email.\n#### AD 14.5 - Request for Relief Under Part B\n11.4 The Applicant requests Part B relief. The relief should include: (1) Setting aside ex parte order obtained through material non-disclosures; (2) Independent forensic audit; (3) Investigation of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts; (4) Investigation of R5.4M stock \"disappearance\"; (5) Recovery of R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (6) Investigation of Ms. Farrar's control and Adderory's role; (7) Consideration of Applicant's delinquency under Section 162(5).\n---\n### 12. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1-16.12: DISCOVERY AND URGENCY\n#### AD 16.1 - Discovery of Respondents' Conduct\n12.1 The Applicant claims discovery of conduct in mid-June 2025. The actual discovery timeline: (1) 15 May: I discovered R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (2) 6 June: Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies; (3) 7 June: Applicant cancelled cards (day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (4) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed audit request. The Applicant's \"discovery\" was actually consciousness of guilt after the Second Respondent exposed fraud to Mr. Bantjies.\n#### AD 16.2 - R600,000 Transfer as Trigger for Action\n12.2 The Applicant cites R600,000 transfer (later corrected to R500,000) as trigger. The actual triggers were: (1) 15 May: I confronted Ms. Farrar about R1,035,000 debt and \"profiting from proceeds of murder\"; (2) 6 June: Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed audit request. The R500,000 transfer is a pretext.\n#### AD 16.5 - Unawareness of Urgent Application Process\n12.3 The Applicant claims unawareness of urgent process. The Applicant had access to legal advice and Mr. Bantjies as Commissioner of Oaths. The delay from mid-June to August contradicts urgency. The actual urgency appears to be preventing forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and systematic fraud.\n#### AD 16.6 - Delay Would Have Been Avoided\n12.4 The Applicant claims delay would have been avoided if he knew the process. The two-month delay (mid-June to August) contradicts urgency. The timing suggests: (1) Waiting to see if Second Respondent's audit request would proceed; (2) Coordinating with Mr. Bantjies (who dismissed audit request 10 June); (3) Preparing my punishment (included in interdict 13 Aug, two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document 11 Aug).\n#### AD 16.8 - State of Shock and Delayed Response\n12.5 The Applicant claims state of shock. The Applicant was not in shock\u2014he was executing a systematic sabotage campaign: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping; (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 7 Jun: Card cancellation; (6) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (7) 11 Sep: Account emptying. This is not shock\u2014this is systematic execution.\n#### AD 16.10 - Attorney Consultation Timeline\n12.6 The Applicant describes attorney consultation. The consultation occurred after: (1) My debt inquiry (15 May); (2) Data expungement (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June); (5) Card cancellation (7 June); (6) Mr. Bantjies's audit dismissal (10 June). The legal action was retaliation, not discovery.\n#### AD 16.12 - Need for Urgent Court Assistance\n12.7 The Applicant claims need for urgent assistance. The Applicant had alternative remedies: (1) Trustee with \"additional powers\" as Founder; (2) Could have conducted audit as trustee; (3) Could have consulted with co-trustee (me) instead of attacking me; (4) Could have consulted with co-trustee Mr. Bantjies (who was facilitating the fraud). The Applicant chose ex parte process to avoid disclosure of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and systematic sabotage.\n---\n### 13. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 17.3-17.4: EX PARTE BASIS\n#### AD 17.3 - Ex Parte Basis for Application\n13.1 The Applicant justifies ex parte application. The ex parte process was abused through material non-disclosures: (1) Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Timeline manipulation (card cancellation day after cooperation); (4) UK payment flow misrepresentation (claimed SA \u2192 UK, actually UK \u2192 SA); (5) R34.9M revenue context omission; (6) My debt inquiry and retaliation pattern; (7) Second Respondent's fraud exposure and retaliation pattern; (8) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email; (9) Adderory's competing domain; (10) R5.4M stock \"disappearance.\"\n#### AD 17.4 - Urgency Justifies Ex Parte Relief\n13.2 The Applicant claims urgency justifies ex parte relief. The urgency was manufactured: (1) Two-month delay contradicts urgency; (2) Card cancellation day after cooperation shows consciousness of guilt; (3) Systematic sabotage from Feb-Sep shows premeditation; (4) I was included two days after signing document, showing coordination; (5) Alternative remedies available as trustee. The ex parte relief was obtained to prevent the Second Respondent and me from exposing the material non-disclosures and systematic fraud.\n---\n### 14. RESPONSE TO REMAINING AD PARAGRAPHS (18.3, 20, 22, 40.9.4, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, 88)\n#### AD 18.3 - Continual Unauthorized Fund Transfers\n14.1 The Applicant alleges continual unauthorized transfers. The unauthorized transfers were made by the Applicant: R450,000 on 14 Feb 2025 + R450,000 on 15 Feb 2025 = R900,000 total from RegimA SA without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director. RegimA SA account: opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 within one month despite 169 customer deposits R566,598.57.\n#### AD 20 - First and Second Respondent Details\n14.2 The Applicant provides the Second Respondent's and my details.

The gross abuse includes: (1) Applicant made R900K unauthorized transfers as director; (2) Applicant cancelled cards without notice as director; (3) Applicant used trustee position to attack beneficiaries; (4) Mr. Bantjies used trustee position to dismiss audit and facilitate fraud; (5) Ms. Farrar used administrative position to control systems, divert revenue, and facilitate son's competing domain.\n#### AD 44 - Applicant Identity Details\n14.5 The Applicant confirms identity. The Applicant's actual position: (1) No access to email (pete@regima.com controlled by Ms. Farrar); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (4) Debtor to Mr. Bantjies (R18.685M due May 2026); (5) Figurehead while Ms. Farrar claims to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions.\n#### AD 50 - Registered Address Details\n14.6 The Applicant provides address: 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview. This is also my address. The Applicant attacked me (co-trustee, beneficiary) with interdict two days after I signed \"Main Trustee\" document, punishing me for investigating R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate and supporting the Second Respondent.\n#### AD 74 - Timeline Context\n14.7 The Applicant provides timeline context. The actual timeline: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping (12-hour deadline); (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 15 May: My debt inquiry; (6) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days later); (7) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days later); (8) 6 Jun: Second Respondent's fraud exposure; (9) 7 Jun: Cards cancelled (1 day later); (10) 10 Jun: Audit dismissed; (11) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotaged; (12) 11 Aug: I sign document; (13) 13 Aug: I included in interdict (2 days later); (14) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied.\n#### AD 78 - Accountant's Office Visit and Discovery\n14.8 The Applicant describes Mr. Bantjies's office visit. The visit occurred after: (1) Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025; (2) Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) Applicant cancelled cards on 7 June 2025 (day after Second Respondent's cooperation). Mr. Bantjies \"discovered\" irregularities after the Second Respondent reported fraud to him. Mr. Bantjies then dismissed audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\"\n#### AD 83 - Irregular Payments Discovery\n14.9 The Applicant describes discovery of irregular payments. The irregular payments include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers by Applicant (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics (same type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments (SARS audit email); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023 (Ms. Farrar falsely claimed paid to me on 15 May 2025).\n#### AD 88 - Follow-up Actions\n14.10 The Applicant describes follow-up actions.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n15.1 I respectfully request that this Honourable Court:\n15.1.1 Set aside the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025 on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n15.1.2 Dismiss the Applicant's application for delinquency or probation orders against the Second Respondent and me.\n15.1.3 Grant a counter-application declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008, on the grounds of:\n- Intentional harm to companies through systematic sabotage;\n- Grossly negligent conduct in card cancellation without notice;\n- Breach of fiduciary duty to beneficiaries as trustee;\n- Abuse of court process through material non-disclosures and false statements.\n15.1.4 Order an independent forensic audit by an impartial auditor to investigate:\n- Mr. Bantjies's conflicts of interest (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant);\n- R5.4 million stock transfer pricing scheme;\n- R1,035,000 debt to Kayla Pretorius's estate;\n- Two years of unallocated expenses;\n- Unauthorized R900,000 transfers;\n- Revenue diversion scheme;\n- Ms. Farrar's control of systems and Adderory's role.\n15.1.5 Order the Applicant to pay the costs of this application on the scale as between attorney and client.\n15.1.6 Grant such further and/or alternative relief as this Honourable Court deems fit.\n---\n### 16. CONCLUSION\n16.1 The evidence presented in this affidavit demonstrates that I fulfilled my fiduciary duties as a trustee by investigating a substantial debt owed to a deceased beneficiary's estate. I confronted Ms. Farrar about this debt on 15 May 2025, stating that keeping the funds would constitute profiting from the proceeds of murder.\n16.2 Within seven days of my inquiry, Shopify data was expunged, eliminating the audit trail. Within 14 days, a competing domain was registered by Ms. Farrar's son's company, diverting customers from the Second Respondent's operations.\n16.3 On 11 August 2025, I was deceived by my co-trustees into signing a \"Main Trustee\" document that backdated the Applicant's designation to 1 July 2025. Two days later, on 13 August 2025, the Applicant and Mr. Bantjies included me in this interdict.\n16.4 The ex parte order was obtained through material non-disclosures, including Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status, his R18.685 million debt to the trust, the timeline showing card cancellation one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation, false statements about UK payment flows, and the omission of the R34.9 million revenue context.\n16.5 The Second Respondent and I support an independent forensic audit by an impartial party. Such an audit would reveal the systematic fraud, conflicts of interest, and abuse of process that underlie this application.\n16.6 I respectfully submit that the balance of convenience overwhelmingly favors setting aside the ex parte order and granting the relief sought in this affidavit.\n---\n**SIGNED at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025.**\n---\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**  \nFirst Respondent\n---\n**THUS SIGNED AND SWORN TO before me at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025, the Deponent having acknowledged that she knows and understands the contents of this Affidavit, that she has no objection to taking the prescribed oath, and that she considers the oath to be binding on her conscience.**\n---\n**COMMISSIONER OF OATHS**\n---\n## LIST OF ANNEXURES\n**JF1:** Trust deed and trustee documentation  \n**JF2:** Email correspondence re R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025)  \n**JF3:** Rynette's false statement documentation  \n**JF4:** Domain registration records (regimaskin.co.za, 29 May 2025)  \n**JF5:** \"Main Trustee\" document (signed 11 Aug 2025, backdated to 1 July 2025)  \n**JF6:** Interdict order (13 Aug 2025)  \n**JF7:** Personal card statements (substitution to prevent collapse)  \n**JF8:** Email from Gee re domain diversion (20 June 2025)\n**DF1:** Shopify operations overview (51+ stores, R34.9M revenue)  \n**DF2:** Villa Via fraud analysis (86% profit margin)  \n**DF3:** Email correspondence with Bantjies (6 June 2025)  \n**DF4:** Card cancellation records (7 June 2025)  \n**DF5-DF7:** Shopify invoices (UK \u2192 SA payment flow, R84,661+ annually)  \n**DF8:** UK bank transactions (corroborating Shopify payments)  \n**DF9:** Unauthorized transfer records (R450K + R450K = R900K, 14-15 Feb 2025)  \n**DF10:** RegimA SA account statements (opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08)  \n**DF11:** Customer deposit records (169 deposits, R566,598.57)  \n**DF12:** Revenue diversion documentation (1 Mar, 14 Apr, 11 Sep 2025)  \n**DF13:** Warehouse sabotage instruction (8 July 2025)  \n**DF14:** Expense dumping documentation (30 Mar 2025)\n**SF1:** Bantjies debt documentation (R18.685M, investment payout schedule)  \n**SF2:** Sage screenshots (Rynette using pete@regima.com, June & Aug 2025)  \n**SF3:** Strategic Logistics R5.4M stock adjustment documentation  \n**SF4:** SARS audit email (Rynette claiming Bantjies instructed payments)  \n**SF5:** Adderory company registration and stock supply documentation  \n**SF6:** Kayla Pretorius estate documentation (R1,035,000 debt)  \n**SF7:** Court order seizing Kayla's email account  \n**SF8:** Linda employment records (bookkeeper)\n---\n**END OF AFFIDAVIT**",

manufactured crisis\n- Section 76(3)(b) of Companies Act - bad faith and improper purpose\n- Section 162(5) of Companies Act - grounds for Peter's delinquency\n- Section 9(1) of Trust Property Control Act - trustee duties\n- Requirements for interdictory relief (clear right, harm, balance of convenience)\n### Strategic Recommendations\n- Emphasize manufactured crisis argument\n- Highlight retaliation pattern\n- Leverage Shopify invoice evidence for perjury\n- Support independent forensic audit\n- Pursue counter-application for Peter's delinquency\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nSent: Saturday, 01 November 2025 14:30\nTo: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.com>; Daniel Faucitt <d@rzo.io>; regizone <regizone@proton.me>\nSubject: AD NOTES - JACQUELINE FAUCITT \n## ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT: JACQUELINE FAUCITT\n**IN THE HIGH COURT OF SOUTH AFRICA**  \n**GAUTENG DIVISION, PRETORIA**\n**Case No:** 2025-137857\n**In the matter between:**\n**PETER ANDREW FAUCITT** \u2014 Applicant\nand\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT** \u2014 First Respondent  \n**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT** \u2014 Second Respondent  \n*(and others)*\n---\n## I, THE UNDERSIGNED\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**\ndo hereby make oath and state that:\n---\n### 1. INTRODUCTION AND CAPACITY\n1.1 I am the First Respondent in this matter, an adult female, and a South African citizen residing at 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview.\n1.2 I am a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust (IT 3651/2013) and a Beneficiary of the same trust. I am also a co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (2017/087935/07) and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (2011/005722/07), both of which are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust.\n1.3 The facts deposed to in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and belief, save where the context indicates otherwise, and are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\n1.4 Where I make legal submissions, I do so on the advice of my legal representatives.\n---\n### 2. PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT\n2.1 This affidavit is filed in response to the Applicant's founding affidavit and the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025.\n2.2 I oppose the relief sought by the Applicant and seek to have the ex parte order set aside on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n2.3 I address each of the Applicant's allegations in the order they appear in the founding affidavit, following the AD paragraph sequence.\n---\n### 3. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 1-3.13: PARTIES AND STRUCTURE\n#### AD 1 - Director Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n3.1 The Applicant invokes provisions relating to director liability for breach of fiduciary duty. I note that the accounting system used to track the alleged breaches was controlled by Rynette Farrar using the Applicant's email address (pete@regima.com), as evidenced by Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 (Annexure **SF2**). The Applicant himself had no access to this system.\n#### AD 1.3 - Applicant's Personal Details and Declaration\n3.2 The Applicant's personal details are noted. I observe that this affidavit was commissioned by Danie Jacobus Bantjies, identified as \"our accountant.\" The full extent of Mr. Bantjies's roles will become apparent through the evidence presented herein.\n#### AD 2 - Company Business Conduct Requirements\n3.3 The Applicant alleges reckless or grossly negligent business conduct. The financial performance of the companies demonstrates the contrary. The Second Respondent and his late partner, Kayla Pretorius, built 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. RegimA SA operates 25 stores with R8.5 million turnover, while RegimA Zone operates 26 stores with R26.4 million turnover. The businesses were highly profitable under the Second Respondent's management.\n#### AD 2.4 - Parties to the Application - Introduction\n3.4 The Applicant introduces the parties. The corporate structure reveals that certain entities are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust, which has three trustees. Two are identified in the founding affidavit: the Applicant and myself. The third trustee's identity was not disclosed to the beneficiaries until recently.\n#### AD 3 - Court Order for Probation of Directors/Members\n3.5 The Applicant seeks probation orders under Section 162 of the Companies Act. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence will demonstrate that the accountant who allegedly \"discovered\" the irregularities has multiple undisclosed roles that create impermissible conflicts.\n#### AD 3.2 - Respondents - Wife\n3.6 I am correctly identified as the Applicant's wife and First Respondent. On 15 May 2025, I confronted Rynette Farrar regarding a debt of R1,035,000 owed by RegimA Skin Treatments CC to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd since February 2023 (Annexure **JF2**). These funds were part of Kayla Pretorius's estate. I informed Ms. Farrar that keeping these funds would constitute profiting from the proceeds of murder. This confrontation proved significant in the events that followed.\n#### AD 3.4 - Respondents - Son\n3.7 The Second Respondent is correctly identified as the Applicant's son. On 6 June 2025, the Second Respondent cooperated with the Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports to the accountant regarding Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC, which is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust (Annexure **DF3**). The Second Respondent unknowingly reported fraud to one of the perpetrators.\n#### AD 3.4.2 - Third Respondent - RegimA Skin Treatments\n3.8 RegimA Skin Treatments CC (B1992/005371/23) owes R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, part of Kayla Pretorius's estate, since February 2023. When I raised this debt on 15 May 2025, Ms. Farrar claimed it was paid\u2014a statement I have since determined to be false. RegimA Skin Treatments receives stock from Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure **SF5**).\n#### AD 3.6 - Fourth Respondent - Regim A UK\n3.9 RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). This contradicts claims made later in the founding affidavit regarding UK entities owing money to SA operations.\n#### AD 3.6.1 - Fifth Respondent - Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC\n3.10 Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC (1996/004451/23) is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. Financial analysis reveals an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group\u2014an excessive profit extraction (Annexure **DF2**). This was the fraud the Second Respondent reported to the accountant on 6 June 2025.\n#### AD 3.6.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Villa Via Arcadia\n3.11 Property registration confirms trust ownership. The trust has three trustees, but only two were known to the beneficiaries at the time of this application.\n#### AD 3.7 - Sixth Respondent - Strategic Logistics CC\n3.12 Strategic Logistics CC (2008/136496/23) experienced a R5.4 million stock adjustment in 2024\u2014stock that allegedly \"just disappeared\" (Annexure **SF3**). This represents 46% of annual sales (R5.4M on R11.3M sales) and is 10 times the prior year's adjustment. The stock type matches inventory supplied by Adderory (Pty) Ltd to RegimA Skin Treatments.\n#### AD 3.7.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Strategic Logistics\n3.13 Property registration documents are noted. In a SARS audit email concerning the R5.4M stock adjustment, Ms. Farrar claimed that Danie Bantjies instructed her to make the substantial payments related to this transaction (Annexure **SF4**).\n#### AD 3.8 - Seventh Respondent - FirstRand Bank (FNB)\n3.14 FNB holds accounts for the companies. On 14 and 15 February 2025, unauthorized transfers of R450,000 each (R900,000 total) were made from RegimA SA's FNB account without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director (Annexure **DF9**). The account opened with R997,597.94 and closed at R5,284.08 within one month, despite 169 customer deposits totaling R566,598.57 proving active trade (Annexure **DF10**, **DF11**).\n#### AD 3.9 - Eighth and Ninth Respondents\n3.15 ABSA Bank and CIPC are cited. Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution began with an ABSA bank letter dated 14 April 2025 (Annexure **DF12**).\n#### AD 3.11 - Reference to Respondents as Wife and Son\n3.16 The Applicant refers to the Second Respondent and me as \"my wife\" and \"my son.\" Both of us are beneficiaries of the Faucitt Family Trust. I am also a co-trustee. The Trust Property Control Act, 57 of 1988, Section 9(1) requires trustees to act with care, diligence, and skill in the interests of beneficiaries.\n#### AD 3.13 - Court Jurisdiction and Identity Confirmation\n3.17 Jurisdiction is confirmed. The affidavit was commissioned by Danie Bantjies, who signed as \"Commissioner of Oaths.\" Mr. Bantjies's accounting firm is \"Bantjes and Company.\" His full relationship to the trust and companies will be revealed through the evidence presented herein.\n---\n### 4. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTANT DETAILS - BANTJIES CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n#### AD 4 - Accountant Details - Bantjes and Company\n4.1 The Applicant identifies \"our accountant\" as Danie Jacobus Bantjies of \"Bantjes and Company,\" who attended the office in mid-June 2025. What the Applicant does not disclose are the following material facts:\n4.1.1 Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust\u2014a status that was unknown to the beneficiaries, the Second Respondent and myself, until recently.\n4.1.2 Mr. Bantjies is a debtor to the trust, owing R18.685 million on an investment payout schedule with payments due in May 2026, May 2027, and May 2029 (Annexure **SF1**).\n4.1.3 Mr. Bantjies controls the financial systems and gave instructions to Ms. Farrar for multi-million rand transactions, as evidenced by emails (Annexure **SF4**).\n4.1.4 Mr. Bantjies was \"running the companies\" when the Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud on 6 June 2025.\n4.1.5 Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\"\n4.2 This creates an impermissible conflict of interest: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant + Company Controller. Mr. Bantjies had a direct financial interest in preventing discovery of the fraud the Second Respondent reported.\n---\n### 5. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1-6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE\n#### AD 6.1 - Relationships Between Parties\n5.1 The Applicant describes family and corporate relationships. The evidence demonstrates a different control structure. Ms. Farrar controlled all bank accounts (the Applicant had no access), controlled the Sage accounting system using the Applicant's email (pete@regima.com), and claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions rather than the Applicant's (Annexure **SF2**). Ms. Farrar's sister, Linda, was employed as bookkeeper, yet two years of expenses remained unallocated until 30 March 2025 (Annexure **SF8**).\n#### AD 6.3 - Directors and Members of Respondent Entities\n5.2 The Applicant describes directorships. The Second Respondent and I are co-directors of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd. RegimA Worldwide Distribution is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. On 30 March 2025, Ms. Farrar and the Applicant dumped two years of unallocated expenses into RegimA Worldwide Distribution and demanded the Second Respondent sign off within 12 hours for SARS VAT and Annual Accounts (Annexure **DF14**). The Second Respondent used this deadline extension (until 6 June) to finalize reports and uncover the Villa Via fraud.\n#### AD 6.5 - Banking and Registration of Respondent Entities\n5.3 The Applicant describes banking arrangements. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to any bank accounts; (2) Ms. Farrar controlled all accounts; (3) Revenue diversion for RegimA SA started 1 March 2025; (4) Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution started 14 April 2025 (ABSA bank letter); (5) On 11 September 2025, R1.73 million was transferred from accounts (Annexure **DF12**).\n---\n### 6. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7-7.20: URGENCY AND ALLEGED MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 7 - Urgency and Delay Considerations\n6.1 The Applicant claims urgency. The timeline reveals: (1) Alleged discovery mid-June 2025; (2) Application filed August 2025; (3) Two-month delay contradicts urgency. The actual urgency relates to the Second Respondent's fraud exposure on 6 June and my debt inquiry on 15 May.\n#### AD 7.3 - Urgency Details\n6.2 The Applicant claims the accountant noted \"numerous discrepancies\" and \"irregular payments\" in mid-June 2025. Timeline analysis reveals: 6 June 2025 (Second Respondent provides comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies), 7 June 2025 (Applicant cancels 15 UK business cards without notice). The card cancellation occurred one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation, not \"following\" any discovery. This demonstrates that the Applicant created the problem he now complains about.\n#### AD 7.6 - Financial Impact of Misconduct\n6.3 The Applicant alleges financial impact. The actual financial sabotage included: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) Revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025; (3) Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025 (100% audit data loss, seven days after my confrontation with Ms. Farrar); (4) Card cancellation 7 June 2025; (5) Domain theft 29 May 2025 (regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory, 14 days after my confrontation, Annexure **JF4**); (6) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 (R34.9M operations destroyed).\n#### AD 7.8 - Continuing Harm to Corporations\n6.4 The Applicant claims continuing harm. The harm was systematically inflicted. An email from Gee dated 20 June 2025 states she was instructed to send a \"don't use regima.zone only use regimaskin.co.za\" email (Annexure **JF8**). The domain regimaskin.co.za is owned by Adderory (Pty) Ltd (Ms. Farrar's son's company), not by RegimA. This diverted customers from the Second Respondent's platforms to a competing domain controlled by Ms. Farrar's family.\n#### AD 7.10 - Card Cancellations and Service Interruptions\n6.5 The Applicant claims he cancelled cards in June 2025 \"following\" the accountant's discovery and requested invoices from the Second Respondent. Timeline evidence demonstrates: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent provides comprehensive reports; (2) 7 June: Applicant cancels UK cards (5191, 5225) paying for Shopify subscriptions (Annexure **DF4**); (3) Cards cancelled one day after cooperation, not after any discovery. The cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible (card-based authentication), then the Applicant complained about missing documentation.\n#### AD 7.13 - Domain and Service Halts Due to Card Cancellations\n6.6 The Applicant claims subscriptions were halted due to card cancellations. To prevent business collapse, the Second Respondent substituted his personal card (1927) for RegimA SA and I substituted my personal card (3212) for RegimA Zone (Annexure **JF7**). Meanwhile, the competing domain regimaskin.co.za was actively diverting customers.\n#### AD 7.16 - Son's Interference with Business Operations\n6.7 The Applicant alleges the Second Respondent interfered with operations. The evidence demonstrates the Second Respondent built and managed 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually (Annexure **DF1**). The Second Respondent's partner, Kayla Pretorius, co-built these operations before her murder on 13 July 2023. After Kayla's death, a court order was obtained to seize her email account (kayp@rzo.io), which interfered with a law enforcement investigation that had instructed a freeze on the account (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.18 - Email and Account Access Interference\n6.8 The Applicant claims the Second Respondent restricted email access. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to his own email (pete@regima.com)\u2014controlled by Ms. Farrar; (2) Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 show Ms. Farrar using the Applicant's email (Annexure **SF2**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's; (4) Kayla's email was seized by court order after her murder (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.20 - Continued Interference Not in Corporate Interests\n6.9 The Applicant claims interference is not in corporate interests. The corporate interests were served by the Second Respondent's profitable operations (R34.9M annually). The interference came from: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Domain theft; (6) Warehouse sabotage. Each action occurred after either my debt inquiry (15 May) or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June).\n---\n### 7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 8.4-9.3: FINANCIAL DISCREPANCIES AND MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 8.4 - Discovery of Financial Discrepancies\n7.1 The Applicant claims the accountant discovered discrepancies. The accountant, Mr. Bantjies, is also: (1) Undisclosed trustee; (2) Debtor owing R18.685M; (3) Controller of financial systems; (4) Recipient of the Second Respondent's fraud report on 6 June 2025. Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025. The \"discovery\" occurred after the Second Respondent exposed fraud to the person facilitating it.\n#### AD 8.5 - Accountant's Attendance and Findings\n7.2 The Applicant states Mr. Bantjies attended for provisional tax and VAT submissions. The two years of unallocated expenses (dumped into RegimA Worldwide Distribution on 30 March 2025) occurred while: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled the accounting system using the Applicant's email; (2) Linda (Ms. Farrar's sister) was employed as bookkeeper (Annexure **SF8**); (3) Mr. Bantjies was the accountant. The question arises: why were expenses unallocated for two years if the accountant and bookkeeper were performing their duties?\n#### AD 8.7 - IT Expenses and Tax Problems\n7.3 The Applicant cites IT expenses: 2024 tax year R6,738,007.47; 2025 tax year R2,116,159.47. The Applicant claims these are \"almost entirely unexplainable.\" The context omitted from the founding affidavit is that these expenses supported 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. The IT expenses represent 19.3% of revenue (2024) and 6.1% of revenue (2025)\u2014reasonable for a global e-commerce operation. The Applicant fails to disclose the revenue context.\n#### AD 8.10 - International Expenses and Tax Implications\n7.4 The Applicant claims expenses are \"seemingly international\" and accounts have \"almost exceeded the yearly allowable quota for funds leaving South Africa.\" The Shopify platforms were funded by UK company RegimA Zone Ltd (company 10697009). UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The international expenses were legitimate costs of UK-owned e-commerce operations.\n#### AD 9.2 - Bank Message Regarding International Transfers\n7.5 The Applicant references bank messages about international transfers. The actual international payment flow is demonstrated by Shopify invoices: UK entities (RegimA Zone Ltd) funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The payment direction is UK \u2192 SA, not SA \u2192 UK as the Applicant's affidavit implies.\n#### AD 9.3 - Financial Misconduct Summary\n7.6 The Applicant summarizes alleged misconduct. The documented financial misconduct includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) without the Second Respondent's authority; (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments (Annexure **SF3**, **SF5**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments for this stock (SARS audit email, Annexure **SF4**); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023, unpaid despite Ms. Farrar's false claim to me that it was paid (Annexure **JF2**, **SF6**).\n---\n### 8. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1-10.14: APPLICATION TO DECLARE RESPONDENTS DELINQUENT\n#### AD 10.1 - Relief Sought - Delinquency or Probation\n8.1 The Applicant seeks delinquency or probation orders under Section 162. The evidence establishes grounds for the Applicant's own delinquency: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers in breach of fiduciary duty as co-director; (2) Card cancellation sabotage one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation; (3) False statements about UK payment flows; (4) Abuse of ex parte process through material non-disclosures.\n#### AD 10.3 - Delinquent Conduct of Respondents\n8.2 The Applicant alleges delinquent conduct by the Second Respondent and me. My actual conduct included: (1) Fulfilling fiduciary duty as trustee by investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025); (2) Confronting Ms. Farrar about profiting from proceeds of murder; (3) Being deceived by co-trustees into signing \"Main Trustee\" document (11 Aug 2025, Annexure **JF5**); (4) Being punished with interdict two days later (13 Aug 2025, Annexure **JF6**).\n#### AD 10.4 - Contravention of Companies Act\n8.3 The Applicant alleges Companies Act contraventions. Section 76(3)(b) requires directors to act in good faith and for a proper purpose. The Applicant's actions demonstrate bad faith: (1) Manufactured crisis (card cancellation day after cooperation); (2) Material non-disclosures in ex parte application; (3) False statements about UK operations; (4) Systematic sabotage of profitable businesses.\n#### AD 10.5.2 - Probation Relief Under Section 162\n8.4 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence reveals: Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) commissioned this affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths. Mr. Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery of the fraud the Second Respondent reported.\n#### AD 10.6 - Close Corporations Act - Fiduciary Duties\n8.5 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act fiduciary duties. The Act requires members to manage in the corporation's interest. RegimA Skin Treatments (CC) owes R1,035,000 to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023. Strategic Logistics (CC) lost R5.4M in stock that \"disappeared\"\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory. These transactions were not in the corporations' interests.\n#### AD 10.6.1 - Member's Duty to Manage in Corporation's Interest\n8.6 The Applicant cites duty to manage in corporation's interest. The R5.4M stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics represents 46% of annual sales\u201410 times the historical adjustment. Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments. This transaction was not in Strategic Logistics' interest.\n#### AD 10.6.2 - Member's Duty Not to Exceed Powers\n8.7 The Applicant cites duty not to exceed powers. The unauthorized R900,000 transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) were made without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director. The Applicant exceeded his powers by acting unilaterally.\n#### AD 10.6.3 - Member's Duty to Avoid Conflicts of Interest\n8.8 The Applicant cites duty to avoid conflicts. The evidence reveals multiple conflicts: (1) Mr. Bantjies: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant; (2) Ms. Farrar's son (Adderory) supplying stock to RegimA Skin Treatments while same stock type \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) Villa Via (trust-owned) charging 86% profit margin rent to group; (4) Regimaskin.co.za (owned by Ms. Farrar's son) competing with RegimA operations.\n#### AD 10.7 - Member Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n8.9 The Applicant invokes breach of fiduciary duty liability. The breaches are established: (1) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to the Second Respondent (co-director) by unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries (as trustee) by attacking them with interdict; (3) Mr. Bantjies breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries by dismissing audit request and facilitating fraud.\n#### AD 10.7.1.2 - Liability for Economic Benefit Derived\n8.10 The Applicant cites liability for economic benefit. The economic benefits derived include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (4) 86% profit margin on Villa Via rent; (5) Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za (Adderory).\n#### AD 10.7.1.4 - Liability for Loss Suffered by Corporation\n8.11 The Applicant cites liability for corporate loss. The losses suffered include: (1) RegimA SA: R900K unauthorized transfers, revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025, Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025; (2) RegimA Zone: Customer diversion to competing domain, card cancellation sabotage; (3) Strategic Logistics: R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (4) RegimA Worldwide: Forced to pay 2 years of unallocated expenses from all companies.\n#### AD 10.8 - Disqualification for Misconduct Under Section 47\n8.12 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act Section 47 disqualification. This section applies when a member is guilty of gross negligence or fraud. The R5.4M stock adjustment (46% of sales, 10x historical) in Strategic Logistics, with Ms. Farrar claiming Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments, and the same stock type supplied by Adderory, suggests systematic fraud.\n#### AD 10.8.1 - Declaration of Delinquency as Alternative Relief\n8.13 The Applicant seeks delinquency declaration. The evidence supports declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5): (1) Intentional harm to companies (systematic sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent conduct (card cancellation without notice); (3) Breach of trust (attacking beneficiaries as trustee); (4) Abuse of process (ex parte order based on material non-disclosures and false statements).\n#### AD 10.9 - Mandatory Disqualification Under Section 162(5)\n8.14 The Applicant invokes Section 162(5) mandatory disqualification grounds. These grounds apply to the Applicant's conduct: (1) Intentional harm to companies (R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent harm (card cancellation rendering documentation inaccessible); (3) Breach of trust (trustee attacking beneficiaries).\n#### AD 10.9.2 - Intentional or Grossly Negligent Harm\n8.15 The Applicant alleges intentional or grossly negligent harm by respondents. The intentional harm was inflicted by the Applicant and his co-conspirators: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent cooperates; (2) 7 June: Cards cancelled; (3) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days after my inquiry); (4) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days after my inquiry); (5) 8 July: Warehouse sabotaged; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action followed either my debt inquiry or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure.\n#### AD 10.9.3 - Manner of Acting - Gross Negligence or Misconduct\n8.16 The Applicant alleges gross negligence or misconduct. The gross negligence is demonstrated by: Cancelling 15 business cards without notice, rendering documentation inaccessible, then complaining about missing documentation. This demonstrates consciousness of guilt and bad faith.\n#### AD 10.9.3.1 - Gross Negligence or Wilful Misconduct\n8.17 The Applicant alleges wilful misconduct. The wilful misconduct includes: (1) Systematic revenue diversion (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (2) Data destruction (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Card sabotage (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). This six-month campaign occurred after I investigated fraud and the Second Respondent exposed fraud.\n#### AD 10.9.3.2 - Acquiescence to Fraudulent Acts\n8.18 The Applicant alleges acquiescence to fraud. The acquiescence to fraud includes: (1) Two years of unallocated expenses while Ms. Farrar controlled systems using the Applicant's email and Linda was employed as bookkeeper; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" with Mr. Bantjies allegedly instructing payments; (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate unpaid since Feb 2023; (4) Villa Via 86% profit margin rent extraction.\n#### AD 10.9.3.3 - Party to Omission with Fraudulent Purpose\n8.19 The Applicant alleges omission with fraudulent purpose.

This section applies when conduct is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) I fulfilled fiduciary duty by investigating debt, then was punished with interdict; (2) Second Respondent exposed fraud to accountant, then suffered six-month sabotage campaign; (3) Both excluded from profitable businesses we built.\n#### AD 10.10.2.3 - Oppressive or Prejudicial Exercise of Powers\n8.21 The Applicant alleges oppressive exercise of powers. The oppressive exercise of powers includes: (1) Applicant used trustee powers to attack beneficiaries; (2) Mr. Bantjies used trustee powers to dismiss audit request and facilitate fraud; (3) Applicant used director powers to make unauthorized R900K transfers; (4) Applicant used court process to obtain ex parte order based on material non-disclosures.\n#### AD 10.10.2.4 - Conduct with Oppressive or Prejudicial Result\n8.22 The Applicant alleges conduct with prejudicial result. The prejudicial results include: (1) I was excluded from companies after investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent excluded from R34.9M operations he built; (3) Customers diverted to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son; (4) R900K transferred without authorization; (5) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (6) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate unpaid.\n#### AD 10.10.22 - Business Conducted in Oppressive Manner\n8.23 The Applicant alleges oppressive business conduct. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled all systems using Applicant's email while claiming to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions; (2) Applicant had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems; (3) Two years of expenses unallocated despite employed bookkeeper; (4) Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) dismissed fraud investigation.\n#### AD 10.10.41 - Conduct Inconsistent with Duties\n8.24 The Applicant alleges conduct inconsistent with duties. The conduct inconsistent with duties includes: (1) Trustee attacking beneficiaries (Applicant, Mr. Bantjies); (2) Director making unauthorized transfers (Applicant); (3) Trustee dismissing fraud investigation (Mr. Bantjies); (4) Accountant facilitating fraud while being debtor (Mr. Bantjies); (5) Administrator controlling systems while diverting revenue (Ms. Farrar).\n#### AD 10.13 - Unaccounted Money - Significant Sums\n8.25 The Applicant alleges unaccounted money. The unaccounted money includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023; (4) R1.73 million transferred 11 Sep 2025; (5) Two years of unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide on 30 Mar 2025.\n#### AD 10.14 - Full Extent of Transgressions Not Yet Determined\n8.26 The Applicant claims full extent not yet determined. The full extent includes: (1) Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email; (4) Ms. Farrar's son's competing domain; (5) Adderory's stock supply relationship; (6) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme; (7) Court order seizing Kayla's email during law enforcement investigation.\n---\n### 9. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 11.2-12.4: UK OPERATIONS AND ALLEGED FRAUD\n#### AD 11.2 - UK Head Office - RegimA UK Ltd\n9.1 The Applicant describes UK operations. RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The UK company is the economic owner of the e-commerce operations.\n#### AD 11.3 - Directors of UK Entity\n9.2 The Applicant describes UK directors. The UK company was established by the Second Respondent and Kayla to own and operate the global e-commerce platforms. After Kayla's murder (13 July 2023), the Second Respondent continued managing the operations.\n#### AD 11.4 - Applicant's Role in Operations\n9.3 The Applicant describes his role. The evidence demonstrates the Applicant had no operational role: (1) No access to email (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (4) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's. The Applicant appears to be a figurehead.\n#### AD 11.6 - UK Branch Operations\n9.4 The Applicant describes UK branch operations. The UK company funded SA operations through Shopify subscription payments. Shopify invoices demonstrate UK \u2192 SA payment flow of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The UK company invested in SA operations, not the reverse.\n#### AD 11.8 - UK Financial Concerns\n9.5 The Applicant expresses UK financial concerns. The financial concerns were manufactured: (1) Card cancellation 7 June 2025 disrupted UK funding; (2) Domain theft 29 May 2025 diverted customers; (3) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 destroyed UK-funded operations; (4) Data expungement 22 May 2025 eliminated audit trail.\n#### AD 12.1 - UK Branch Non-Payment and Fraud Concerns\n9.6 The Applicant alleges UK branch non-payment and fraud. The Shopify invoices prove the opposite: UK entities funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). UK bank transactions corroborate the invoices (Annexure **DF8**). The Applicant's statement is demonstrably false.\n#### AD 12.2 - Misappropriation Leading to Insolvency Risk\n9.7 The Applicant alleges misappropriation leading to insolvency. The actual insolvency risk was created by: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (3) Data expungement (22 May); (4) Card cancellation (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). Despite six months of sabotage, the Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied.\n#### AD 12.3 - Purpose of Court Application\n9.8 The Applicant states the purpose is to prevent further harm. The actual purpose appears to be: (1) Punish me for investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May); (2) Punish Second Respondent for exposing Villa Via fraud (6 June); (3) Seize control of R34.9M operations Second Respondent built; (4) Prevent forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and the systematic fraud.\n#### AD 12.4 - Alternative Roles for Wife and Son\n9.9 The Applicant suggests alternative roles for the Second Respondent and me. The evidence demonstrates: (1) I fulfilled trustee duties by investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent built and managed R34.9M profitable operations; (3) Both were systematically sabotaged after investigating/exposing fraud; (4) Both were attacked with interdict by co-trustees; (5) I was included in interdict two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document.\n---\n### 10. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 13.2-13.8: REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERDICTORY RELIEF\n#### AD 13.2 - Clear Right Not to Be Prejudiced\n10.1 The Applicant claims clear right not to be prejudiced. The Applicant has no clear right: (1) He manufactured the crisis (card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (2) He made unauthorized R900K transfers; (3) He had alternative remedies as trustee with \"additional powers\"; (4) He obtained order through material non-disclosures (Mr. Bantjies's trustee status, debtor status, timeline manipulation, UK payment flow misrepresentation).\n#### AD 13.2.2 - Injury Sustained and Apprehension of Further Harm\n10.2 The Applicant claims injury and apprehension of harm. The Applicant suffered no injury he didn't inflict on himself: (1) Card cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible; (2) Unauthorized transfers depleted accounts; (3) Revenue diversions reduced cash flow; (4) Warehouse sabotage destroyed operations. The apprehension of further harm was manufactured to justify ex parte relief.\n#### AD 13.3 - Reasonable Apprehension of Irreparable Harm\n10.3 The Applicant claims reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm. The irreparable harm was inflicted by the Applicant's six-month sabotage campaign: (1) R34.9M operations destroyed (93.3% revenue collapse); (2) Customer relationships diverted to competing domain; (3) Audit data expunged (100% loss); (4) Documentation rendered inaccessible; (5) Accounts emptied. The Second Respondent and I suffered irreparable harm, not the Applicant.\n#### AD 13.4 - Interdicts Essential for Corporation Survival\n10.4 The Applicant claims interdicts essential for survival. The corporations were profitable under the Second Respondent's management (R34.9M annually). The survival threat came from the Applicant's sabotage: (1) Unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data destruction; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Excluding the Second Respondent and me threatened survival, not ensured it.\n#### AD 13.5 - Balance of Convenience Favours Granting Relief\n10.5 The Applicant claims balance of convenience favors relief. The balance overwhelmingly favors the Second Respondent and me: (1) We built and managed profitable operations; (2) We investigated and exposed fraud; (3) We were systematically sabotaged for doing so; (4) We substituted personal cards to prevent business collapse; (5) We support independent forensic audit. The Applicant obtained relief through material non-disclosures and false statements.\n#### AD 13.8 - Other Relief Sought in Part A\n10.6 The Applicant seeks additional relief. The relief was obtained ex parte based on: (1) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Omitting timeline showing card cancellation day after cooperation; (4) Falsely claiming UK owes SA (opposite is true); (5) Omitting R34.9M revenue context; (6) Omitting my debt inquiry and retaliation pattern.\n---\n### 11. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1-14.5: FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND FORENSIC AUDIT\n#### AD 14.1 - Financial Constraints on Respondents\n11.1 The Applicant seeks financial constraints on the Second Respondent and me. The financial constraints were already imposed through sabotage: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Despite six months of sabotage, the Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors.\n#### AD 14.3 - Constraint to Prevent Financial Prejudice\n11.2 The Applicant seeks constraints to prevent prejudice. The prejudice was inflicted by the Applicant: (1) RegimA SA account opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 (Feb-Mar 2025); (2) 169 customer deposits R566,598.57 proving active trade; (3) R1.73M transferred 11 Sep 2025; (4) R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage.\n#### AD 14.4 - Forensic Audit Necessity and Remuneration\n11.3 The Applicant seeks forensic audit. The Second Respondent and I support independent forensic audit by an impartial party. Such audit would reveal: (1) Mr. Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant); (2) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme (Strategic Logistics \u2192 Adderory \u2192 RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (4) Two years unallocated expenses; (5) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (6) Revenue diversion scheme; (7) Ms. Farrar's control of systems using Applicant's email.\n#### AD 14.5 - Request for Relief Under Part B\n11.4 The Applicant requests Part B relief. The relief should include: (1) Setting aside ex parte order obtained through material non-disclosures; (2) Independent forensic audit; (3) Investigation of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts; (4) Investigation of R5.4M stock \"disappearance\"; (5) Recovery of R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (6) Investigation of Ms. Farrar's control and Adderory's role; (7) Consideration of Applicant's delinquency under Section 162(5).\n---\n### 12. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1-16.12: DISCOVERY AND URGENCY\n#### AD 16.1 - Discovery of Respondents' Conduct\n12.1 The Applicant claims discovery of conduct in mid-June 2025. The actual discovery timeline: (1) 15 May: I discovered R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (2) 6 June: Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies; (3) 7 June: Applicant cancelled cards (day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (4) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed audit request. The Applicant's \"discovery\" was actually consciousness of guilt after the Second Respondent exposed fraud to Mr. Bantjies.\n#### AD 16.2 - R600,000 Transfer as Trigger for Action\n12.2 The Applicant cites R600,000 transfer (later corrected to R500,000) as trigger. The actual triggers were: (1) 15 May: I confronted Ms. Farrar about R1,035,000 debt and \"profiting from proceeds of murder\"; (2) 6 June: Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed audit request. The R500,000 transfer is a pretext.\n#### AD 16.5 - Unawareness of Urgent Application Process\n12.3 The Applicant claims unawareness of urgent process. The Applicant had access to legal advice and Mr. Bantjies as Commissioner of Oaths. The delay from mid-June to August contradicts urgency. The actual urgency appears to be preventing forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and systematic fraud.\n#### AD 16.6 - Delay Would Have Been Avoided\n12.4 The Applicant claims delay would have been avoided if he knew the process. The two-month delay (mid-June to August) contradicts urgency. The timing suggests: (1) Waiting to see if Second Respondent's audit request would proceed; (2) Coordinating with Mr. Bantjies (who dismissed audit request 10 June); (3) Preparing my punishment (included in interdict 13 Aug, two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document 11 Aug).\n#### AD 16.8 - State of Shock and Delayed Response\n12.5 The Applicant claims state of shock. The Applicant was not in shock\u2014he was executing a systematic sabotage campaign: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping; (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 7 Jun: Card cancellation; (6) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (7) 11 Sep: Account emptying. This is not shock\u2014this is systematic execution.\n#### AD 16.10 - Attorney Consultation Timeline\n12.6 The Applicant describes attorney consultation. The consultation occurred after: (1) My debt inquiry (15 May); (2) Data expungement (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June); (5) Card cancellation (7 June); (6) Mr. Bantjies's audit dismissal (10 June). The legal action was retaliation, not discovery.\n#### AD 16.12 - Need for Urgent Court Assistance\n12.7 The Applicant claims need for urgent assistance. The Applicant had alternative remedies: (1) Trustee with \"additional powers\" as Founder; (2) Could have conducted audit as trustee; (3) Could have consulted with co-trustee (me) instead of attacking me; (4) Could have consulted with co-trustee Mr. Bantjies (who was facilitating the fraud). The Applicant chose ex parte process to avoid disclosure of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and systematic sabotage.\n---\n### 13. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 17.3-17.4: EX PARTE BASIS\n#### AD 17.3 - Ex Parte Basis for Application\n13.1 The Applicant justifies ex parte application. The ex parte process was abused through material non-disclosures: (1) Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Timeline manipulation (card cancellation day after cooperation); (4) UK payment flow misrepresentation (claimed SA \u2192 UK, actually UK \u2192 SA); (5) R34.9M revenue context omission; (6) My debt inquiry and retaliation pattern; (7) Second Respondent's fraud exposure and retaliation pattern; (8) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email; (9) Adderory's competing domain; (10) R5.4M stock \"disappearance.\"\n#### AD 17.4 - Urgency Justifies Ex Parte Relief\n13.2 The Applicant claims urgency justifies ex parte relief. The urgency was manufactured: (1) Two-month delay contradicts urgency; (2) Card cancellation day after cooperation shows consciousness of guilt; (3) Systematic sabotage from Feb-Sep shows premeditation; (4) I was included two days after signing document, showing coordination; (5) Alternative remedies available as trustee. The ex parte relief was obtained to prevent the Second Respondent and me from exposing the material non-disclosures and systematic fraud.\n---\n### 14. RESPONSE TO REMAINING AD PARAGRAPHS (18.3, 20, 22, 40.9.4, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, 88)\n#### AD 18.3 - Continual Unauthorized Fund Transfers\n14.1 The Applicant alleges continual unauthorized transfers. The unauthorized transfers were made by the Applicant: R450,000 on 14 Feb 2025 + R450,000 on 15 Feb 2025 = R900,000 total from RegimA SA without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director. RegimA SA account: opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 within one month despite 169 customer deposits R566,598.57.\n#### AD 20 - First and Second Respondent Details\n14.2 The Applicant provides the Second Respondent's and my details. The details omitted include: (1) I confronted Ms. Farrar about R1,035,000 debt on 15 May 2025; (2) I was deceived into signing \"Main Trustee\" document on 11 Aug 2025; (3) I was included in interdict on 13 Aug 2025 (two days later); (4) Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud on 6 June 2025; (5) Second Respondent suffered six-month sabotage campaign; (6) Second Respondent built R34.9M profitable operations with murdered partner Kayla.\n#### AD 22 - Additional Party Information\n14.3 The Applicant provides additional information. The information omitted includes: (1) Faucitt Family Trust has three trustees: Applicant, me, Mr. Bantjies; (2) Mr. Bantjies's trustee status was unknown to beneficiaries; (3) Mr. Bantjies is debtor owing R18.685M; (4) Mr. Bantjies is accountant controlling financial systems; (5) Mr. Bantjies dismissed Second Respondent's audit request; (6) Mr. Bantjies commissioned this affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths.\n#### AD 40.9.4 - Gross Abuse of Director/Member Position\n14.4 The Applicant alleges gross abuse of position. The gross abuse includes: (1) Applicant made R900K unauthorized transfers as director; (2) Applicant cancelled cards without notice as director; (3) Applicant used trustee position to attack beneficiaries; (4) Mr. Bantjies used trustee position to dismiss audit and facilitate fraud; (5) Ms. Farrar used administrative position to control systems, divert revenue, and facilitate son's competing domain.\n#### AD 44 - Applicant Identity Details\n14.5 The Applicant confirms identity. The Applicant's actual position: (1) No access to email (pete@regima.com controlled by Ms. Farrar); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (4) Debtor to Mr. Bantjies (R18.685M due May 2026); (5) Figurehead while Ms. Farrar claims to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions.\n#### AD 50 - Registered Address Details\n14.6 The Applicant provides address: 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview. This is also my address. The Applicant attacked me (co-trustee, beneficiary) with interdict two days after I signed \"Main Trustee\" document, punishing me for investigating R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate and supporting the Second Respondent.\n#### AD 74 - Timeline Context\n14.7 The Applicant provides timeline context. The actual timeline: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping (12-hour deadline); (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 15 May: My debt inquiry; (6) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days later); (7) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days later); (8) 6 Jun: Second Respondent's fraud exposure; (9) 7 Jun: Cards cancelled (1 day later); (10) 10 Jun: Audit dismissed; (11) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotaged; (12) 11 Aug: I sign document; (13) 13 Aug: I included in interdict (2 days later); (14) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied.\n#### AD 78 - Accountant's Office Visit and Discovery\n14.8 The Applicant describes Mr. Bantjies's office visit. The visit occurred after: (1) Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025; (2) Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) Applicant cancelled cards on 7 June 2025 (day after Second Respondent's cooperation). Mr. Bantjies \"discovered\" irregularities after the Second Respondent reported fraud to him. Mr. Bantjies then dismissed audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\"\n#### AD 83 - Irregular Payments Discovery\n14.9 The Applicant describes discovery of irregular payments. The irregular payments include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers by Applicant (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics (same type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments (SARS audit email); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023 (Ms. Farrar falsely claimed paid to me on 15 May 2025).\n#### AD 88 - Follow-up Actions\n14.10 The Applicant describes follow-up actions. The follow-up actions include: (1) 7 Jun: Card cancellation (day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (2) 10 Jun: Mr. Bantjies dismisses audit; (3) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (4) 11 Aug: I was deceived into signing document; (5) 13 Aug: I was included in interdict; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action was retaliation against me (15 May debt inquiry) and the Second Respondent (6 Jun fraud exposure).\n---\n### 15. PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n15.1 I respectfully request that this Honourable Court:\n15.1.1 Set aside the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025 on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n15.1.2 Dismiss the Applicant's application for delinquency or probation orders against the Second Respondent and me.\n15.1.3 Grant a counter-application declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008, on the grounds of:\n- Intentional harm to companies through systematic sabotage;\n- Grossly negligent conduct in card cancellation without notice;\n- Breach of fiduciary duty to beneficiaries as trustee;\n- Abuse of court process through material non-disclosures and false statements.\n15.1.4 Order an independent forensic audit by an impartial auditor to investigate:\n- Mr. Bantjies's conflicts of interest (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant);\n- R5.4 million stock transfer pricing scheme;\n- R1,035,000 debt to Kayla Pretorius's estate;\n- Two years of unallocated expenses;\n- Unauthorized R900,000 transfers;\n- Revenue diversion scheme;\n- Ms. Farrar's control of systems and Adderory's role.\n15.1.5 Order the Applicant to pay the costs of this application on the scale as between attorney and client.\n15.1.6 Grant such further and/or alternative relief as this Honourable Court deems fit.\n---\n### 16. CONCLUSION\n16.1 The evidence presented in this affidavit demonstrates that I fulfilled my fiduciary duties as a trustee by investigating a substantial debt owed to a deceased beneficiary's estate. I confronted Ms. Farrar about this debt on 15 May 2025, stating that keeping the funds would constitute profiting from the proceeds of murder.\n16.2 Within seven days of my inquiry, Shopify data was expunged, eliminating the audit trail. Within 14 days, a competing domain was registered by Ms. Farrar's son's company, diverting customers from the Second Respondent's operations.\n16.3 On 11 August 2025, I was deceived by my co-trustees into signing a \"Main Trustee\" document that backdated the Applicant's designation to 1 July 2025. Two days later, on 13 August 2025, the Applicant and Mr. Bantjies included me in this interdict.\n16.4 The ex parte order was obtained through material non-disclosures, including Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status, his R18.685 million debt to the trust, the timeline showing card cancellation one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation, false statements about UK payment flows, and the omission of the R34.9 million revenue context.\n16.5 The Second Respondent and I support an independent forensic audit by an impartial party. Such an audit would reveal the systematic fraud, conflicts of interest, and abuse of process that underlie this application.\n16.6 I respectfully submit that the balance of convenience overwhelmingly favors setting aside the ex parte order and granting the relief sought in this affidavit.\n---\n**SIGNED at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025.**\n---\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**  \nFirst Respondent\n---\n**THUS SIGNED AND SWORN TO before me at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025, the Deponent having acknowledged that she knows and understands the contents of this Affidavit, that she has no objection to taking the prescribed oath, and that she considers the oath to be binding on her conscience.**\n---\n**COMMISSIONER OF OATHS**\n---\n## LIST OF ANNEXURES\n**JF1:** Trust deed and trustee documentation  \n**JF2:** Email correspondence re R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025)  \n**JF3:** Rynette's false statement documentation  \n**JF4:** Domain registration records (regimaskin.co.za, 29 May 2025)  \n**JF5:** \"Main Trustee\" document (signed 11 Aug 2025, backdated to 1 July 2025)  \n**JF6:** Interdict order (13 Aug 2025)  \n**JF7:** Personal card statements (substitution to prevent collapse)  \n**JF8:** Email from Gee re domain diversion (20 June 2025)\n**DF1:** Shopify operations overview (51+ stores, R34.9M revenue)  \n**DF2:** Villa Via fraud analysis (86% profit margin)  \n**DF3:** Email correspondence with Bantjies (6 June 2025)  \n**DF4:** Card cancellation records (7 June 2025)  \n**DF5-DF7:** Shopify invoices (UK \u2192 SA payment flow, R84,661+ annually)  \n**DF8:** UK bank transactions (corroborating Shopify payments)  \n**DF9:** Unauthorized transfer records (R450K + R450K = R900K, 14-15 Feb 2025)  \n**DF10:** RegimA SA account statements (opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08)  \n**DF11:** Customer deposit records (169 deposits, R566,598.57)  \n**DF12:** Revenue diversion documentation (1 Mar, 14 Apr, 11 Sep 2025)  \n**DF13:** Warehouse sabotage instruction (8 July 2025)  \n**DF14:** Expense dumping documentation (30 Mar 2025)\n**SF1:** Bantjies debt documentation (R18.685M, investment payout schedule)  \n**SF2:** Sage screenshots (Rynette using pete@regima.com, June & Aug 2025)  \n**SF3:** Strategic Logistics R5.4M stock adjustment documentation  \n**SF4:** SARS audit email (Rynette claiming Bantjies instructed payments)  \n**SF5:** Adderory company registration and stock supply documentation  \n**SF6:** Kayla Pretorius estate documentation (R1,035,000 debt)  \n**SF7:** Court order seizing Kayla's email account  \n**SF8:** Linda employment records (bookkeeper)\n---\n**END OF AFFIDAVIT**",

fraud\n4.The Ex Parte Deception: Material non-disclosures and false statements\n5.The Manufactured Crisis: Peter created the problems he complains about\n6.The Truth: UK funded SA (not vice versa), IT expenses reasonable for R34.9M operations\nThe narrative allows connections to become self-evident through gradual revelation, maintaining professional tone while building an irrefutable case through

manufactured crisis\n- Section 76(3)(b) of Companies Act - bad faith and improper purpose\n- Section 162(5) of Companies Act - grounds for Peter's delinquency\n- Section 9(1) of Trust Property Control Act - trustee duties\n- Requirements for interdictory relief (clear right, harm, balance of convenience)\n### Strategic Recommendations\n- Emphasize manufactured crisis argument\n- Highlight retaliation pattern\n- Leverage Shopify invoice evidence for perjury\n- Support independent forensic audit\n- Pursue counter-application for Peter's delinquency\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nSent: Saturday, 01 November 2025 14:30\nTo: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.com>; Daniel Faucitt <d@rzo.io>; regizone <regizone@proton.me>\nSubject: AD NOTES - JACQUELINE FAUCITT \n## ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT: JACQUELINE FAUCITT\n**IN THE HIGH COURT OF SOUTH AFRICA**  \n**GAUTENG DIVISION, PRETORIA**\n**Case No:** 2025-137857\n**In the matter between:**\n**PETER ANDREW FAUCITT** \u2014 Applicant\nand\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT** \u2014 First Respondent  \n**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT** \u2014 Second Respondent  \n*(and others)*\n---\n## I, THE UNDERSIGNED\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**\ndo hereby make oath and state that:\n---\n### 1. INTRODUCTION AND CAPACITY\n1.1 I am the First Respondent in this matter, an adult female, and a South African citizen residing at 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview.\n1.2 I am a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust (IT 3651/2013) and a Beneficiary of the same trust. I am also a co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (2017/087935/07) and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (2011/005722/07), both of which are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust.\n1.3 The facts deposed to in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and belief, save where the context indicates otherwise, and are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\n1.4 Where I make legal submissions, I do so on the advice of my legal representatives.\n---\n### 2. PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT\n2.1 This affidavit is filed in response to the Applicant's founding affidavit and the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025.\n2.2 I oppose the relief sought by the Applicant and seek to have the ex parte order set aside on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n2.3 I address each of the Applicant's allegations in the order they appear in the founding affidavit, following the AD paragraph sequence.\n---\n### 3. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 1-3.13: PARTIES AND STRUCTURE\n#### AD 1 - Director Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n3.1 The Applicant invokes provisions relating to director liability for breach of fiduciary duty. I note that the accounting system used to track the alleged breaches was controlled by Rynette Farrar using the Applicant's email address (pete@regima.com), as evidenced by Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 (Annexure **SF2**). The Applicant himself had no access to this system.\n#### AD 1.3 - Applicant's Personal Details and Declaration\n3.2 The Applicant's personal details are noted. I observe that this affidavit was commissioned by Danie Jacobus Bantjies, identified as \"our accountant.\" The full extent of Mr. Bantjies's roles will become apparent through the evidence presented herein.\n#### AD 2 - Company Business Conduct Requirements\n3.3 The Applicant alleges reckless or grossly negligent business conduct. The financial performance of the companies demonstrates the contrary. The Second Respondent and his late partner, Kayla Pretorius, built 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. RegimA SA operates 25 stores with R8.5 million turnover, while RegimA Zone operates 26 stores with R26.4 million turnover. The businesses were highly profitable under the Second Respondent's management.\n#### AD 2.4 - Parties to the Application - Introduction\n3.4 The Applicant introduces the parties. The corporate structure reveals that certain entities are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust, which has three trustees. Two are identified in the founding affidavit: the Applicant and myself. The third trustee's identity was not disclosed to the beneficiaries until recently.\n#### AD 3 - Court Order for Probation of Directors/Members\n3.5 The Applicant seeks probation orders under Section 162 of the Companies Act. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence will demonstrate that the accountant who allegedly \"discovered\" the irregularities has multiple undisclosed roles that create impermissible conflicts.\n#### AD 3.2 - Respondents - Wife\n3.6 I am correctly identified as the Applicant's wife and First Respondent. On 15 May 2025, I confronted Rynette Farrar regarding a debt of R1,035,000 owed by RegimA Skin Treatments CC to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd since February 2023 (Annexure **JF2**). These funds were part of Kayla Pretorius's estate. I informed Ms. Farrar that keeping these funds would constitute profiting from the proceeds of murder. This confrontation proved significant in the events that followed.\n#### AD 3.4 - Respondents - Son\n3.7 The Second Respondent is correctly identified as the Applicant's son. On 6 June 2025, the Second Respondent cooperated with the Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports to the accountant regarding Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC, which is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust (Annexure **DF3**). The Second Respondent unknowingly reported fraud to one of the perpetrators.\n#### AD 3.4.2 - Third Respondent - RegimA Skin Treatments\n3.8 RegimA Skin Treatments CC (B1992/005371/23) owes R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, part of Kayla Pretorius's estate, since February 2023. When I raised this debt on 15 May 2025, Ms. Farrar claimed it was paid\u2014a statement I have since determined to be false. RegimA Skin Treatments receives stock from Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure **SF5**).\n#### AD 3.6 - Fourth Respondent - Regim A UK\n3.9 RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). This contradicts claims made later in the founding affidavit regarding UK entities owing money to SA operations.\n#### AD 3.6.1 - Fifth Respondent - Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC\n3.10 Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC (1996/004451/23) is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. Financial analysis reveals an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group\u2014an excessive profit extraction (Annexure **DF2**). This was the fraud the Second Respondent reported to the accountant on 6 June 2025.\n#### AD 3.6.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Villa Via Arcadia\n3.11 Property registration confirms trust ownership. The trust has three trustees, but only two were known to the beneficiaries at the time of this application.\n#### AD 3.7 - Sixth Respondent - Strategic Logistics CC\n3.12 Strategic Logistics CC (2008/136496/23) experienced a R5.4 million stock adjustment in 2024\u2014stock that allegedly \"just disappeared\" (Annexure **SF3**). This represents 46% of annual sales (R5.4M on R11.3M sales) and is 10 times the prior year's adjustment. The stock type matches inventory supplied by Adderory (Pty) Ltd to RegimA Skin Treatments.\n#### AD 3.7.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Strategic Logistics\n3.13 Property registration documents are noted. In a SARS audit email concerning the R5.4M stock adjustment, Ms. Farrar claimed that Danie Bantjies instructed her to make the substantial payments related to this transaction (Annexure **SF4**).\n#### AD 3.8 - Seventh Respondent - FirstRand Bank (FNB)\n3.14 FNB holds accounts for the companies. On 14 and 15 February 2025, unauthorized transfers of R450,000 each (R900,000 total) were made from RegimA SA's FNB account without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director (Annexure **DF9**). The account opened with R997,597.94 and closed at R5,284.08 within one month, despite 169 customer deposits totaling R566,598.57 proving active trade (Annexure **DF10**, **DF11**).\n#### AD 3.9 - Eighth and Ninth Respondents\n3.15 ABSA Bank and CIPC are cited. Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution began with an ABSA bank letter dated 14 April 2025 (Annexure **DF12**).\n#### AD 3.11 - Reference to Respondents as Wife and Son\n3.16 The Applicant refers to the Second Respondent and me as \"my wife\" and \"my son.\" Both of us are beneficiaries of the Faucitt Family Trust. I am also a co-trustee. The Trust Property Control Act, 57 of 1988, Section 9(1) requires trustees to act with care, diligence, and skill in the interests of beneficiaries.\n#### AD 3.13 - Court Jurisdiction and Identity Confirmation\n3.17 Jurisdiction is confirmed. The affidavit was commissioned by Danie Bantjies, who signed as \"Commissioner of Oaths.\" Mr. Bantjies's accounting firm is \"Bantjes and Company.\" His full relationship to the trust and companies will be revealed through the evidence presented herein.\n---\n### 4. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTANT DETAILS - BANTJIES CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n#### AD 4 - Accountant Details - Bantjes and Company\n4.1 The Applicant identifies \"our accountant\" as Danie Jacobus Bantjies of \"Bantjes and Company,\" who attended the office in mid-June 2025. What the Applicant does not disclose are the following material facts:\n4.1.1 Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust\u2014a status that was unknown to the beneficiaries, the Second Respondent and myself, until recently.\n4.1.2 Mr. Bantjies is a debtor to the trust, owing R18.685 million on an investment payout schedule with payments due in May 2026, May 2027, and May 2029 (Annexure **SF1**).\n4.1.3 Mr. Bantjies controls the financial systems and gave instructions to Ms. Farrar for multi-million rand transactions, as evidenced by emails (Annexure **SF4**).\n4.1.4 Mr. Bantjies was \"running the companies\" when the Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud on 6 June 2025.\n4.1.5 Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\"\n4.2 This creates an impermissible conflict of interest: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant + Company Controller. Mr. Bantjies had a direct financial interest in preventing discovery of the fraud the Second Respondent reported.\n---\n### 5. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1-6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE\n#### AD 6.1 - Relationships Between Parties\n5.1 The Applicant describes family and corporate relationships. The evidence demonstrates a different control structure. Ms. Farrar controlled all bank accounts (the Applicant had no access), controlled the Sage accounting system using the Applicant's email (pete@regima.com), and claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions rather than the Applicant's (Annexure **SF2**). Ms. Farrar's sister, Linda, was employed as bookkeeper, yet two years of expenses remained unallocated until 30 March 2025 (Annexure **SF8**).\n#### AD 6.3 - Directors and Members of Respondent Entities\n5.2 The Applicant describes directorships. The Second Respondent and I are co-directors of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd. RegimA Worldwide Distribution is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. On 30 March 2025, Ms. Farrar and the Applicant dumped two years of unallocated expenses into RegimA Worldwide Distribution and demanded the Second Respondent sign off within 12 hours for SARS VAT and Annual Accounts (Annexure **DF14**). The Second Respondent used this deadline extension (until 6 June) to finalize reports and uncover the Villa Via fraud.\n#### AD 6.5 - Banking and Registration of Respondent Entities\n5.3 The Applicant describes banking arrangements. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to any bank accounts; (2) Ms. Farrar controlled all accounts; (3) Revenue diversion for RegimA SA started 1 March 2025; (4) Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution started 14 April 2025 (ABSA bank letter); (5) On 11 September 2025, R1.73 million was transferred from accounts (Annexure **DF12**).\n---\n### 6. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7-7.20: URGENCY AND ALLEGED MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 7 - Urgency and Delay Considerations\n6.1 The Applicant claims urgency. The timeline reveals: (1) Alleged discovery mid-June 2025; (2) Application filed August 2025; (3) Two-month delay contradicts urgency. The actual urgency relates to the Second Respondent's fraud exposure on 6 June and my debt inquiry on 15 May.\n#### AD 7.3 - Urgency Details\n6.2 The Applicant claims the accountant noted \"numerous discrepancies\" and \"irregular payments\" in mid-June 2025. Timeline analysis reveals: 6 June 2025 (Second Respondent provides comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies), 7 June 2025 (Applicant cancels 15 UK business cards without notice). The card cancellation occurred one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation, not \"following\" any discovery. This demonstrates that the Applicant created the problem he now complains about.\n#### AD 7.6 - Financial Impact of Misconduct\n6.3 The Applicant alleges financial impact. The actual financial sabotage included: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) Revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025; (3) Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025 (100% audit data loss, seven days after my confrontation with Ms. Farrar); (4) Card cancellation 7 June 2025; (5) Domain theft 29 May 2025 (regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory, 14 days after my confrontation, Annexure **JF4**); (6) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 (R34.9M operations destroyed).\n#### AD 7.8 - Continuing Harm to Corporations\n6.4 The Applicant claims continuing harm. The harm was systematically inflicted. An email from Gee dated 20 June 2025 states she was instructed to send a \"don't use regima.zone only use regimaskin.co.za\" email (Annexure **JF8**). The domain regimaskin.co.za is owned by Adderory (Pty) Ltd (Ms. Farrar's son's company), not by RegimA. This diverted customers from the Second Respondent's platforms to a competing domain controlled by Ms. Farrar's family.\n#### AD 7.10 - Card Cancellations and Service Interruptions\n6.5 The Applicant claims he cancelled cards in June 2025 \"following\" the accountant's discovery and requested invoices from the Second Respondent. Timeline evidence demonstrates: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent provides comprehensive reports; (2) 7 June: Applicant cancels UK cards (5191, 5225) paying for Shopify subscriptions (Annexure **DF4**); (3) Cards cancelled one day after cooperation, not after any discovery. The cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible (card-based authentication), then the Applicant complained about missing documentation.\n#### AD 7.13 - Domain and Service Halts Due to Card Cancellations\n6.6 The Applicant claims subscriptions were halted due to card cancellations. To prevent business collapse, the Second Respondent substituted his personal card (1927) for RegimA SA and I substituted my personal card (3212) for RegimA Zone (Annexure **JF7**). Meanwhile, the competing domain regimaskin.co.za was actively diverting customers.\n#### AD 7.16 - Son's Interference with Business Operations\n6.7 The Applicant alleges the Second Respondent interfered with operations. The evidence demonstrates the Second Respondent built and managed 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually (Annexure **DF1**). The Second Respondent's partner, Kayla Pretorius, co-built these operations before her murder on 13 July 2023. After Kayla's death, a court order was obtained to seize her email account (kayp@rzo.io), which interfered with a law enforcement investigation that had instructed a freeze on the account (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.18 - Email and Account Access Interference\n6.8 The Applicant claims the Second Respondent restricted email access. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to his own email (pete@regima.com)\u2014controlled by Ms. Farrar; (2) Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 show Ms. Farrar using the Applicant's email (Annexure **SF2**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's; (4) Kayla's email was seized by court order after her murder (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.20 - Continued Interference Not in Corporate Interests\n6.9 The Applicant claims interference is not in corporate interests. The corporate interests were served by the Second Respondent's profitable operations (R34.9M annually). The interference came from: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Domain theft; (6) Warehouse sabotage. Each action occurred after either my debt inquiry (15 May) or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June).\n---\n### 7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 8.4-9.3: FINANCIAL DISCREPANCIES AND MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 8.4 - Discovery of Financial Discrepancies\n7.1 The Applicant claims the accountant discovered discrepancies. The accountant, Mr. Bantjies, is also: (1) Undisclosed trustee; (2) Debtor owing R18.685M; (3) Controller of financial systems; (4) Recipient of the Second Respondent's fraud report on 6 June 2025. Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025. The \"discovery\" occurred after the Second Respondent exposed fraud to the person facilitating it.\n#### AD 8.5 - Accountant's Attendance and Findings\n7.2 The Applicant states Mr. Bantjies attended for provisional tax and VAT submissions. The two years of unallocated expenses (dumped into RegimA Worldwide Distribution on 30 March 2025) occurred while: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled the accounting system using the Applicant's email; (2) Linda (Ms. Farrar's sister) was employed as bookkeeper (Annexure **SF8**); (3) Mr. Bantjies was the accountant. The question arises: why were expenses unallocated for two years if the accountant and bookkeeper were performing their duties?\n#### AD 8.7 - IT Expenses and Tax Problems\n7.3 The Applicant cites IT expenses: 2024 tax year R6,738,007.47; 2025 tax year R2,116,159.47. The Applicant claims these are \"almost entirely unexplainable.\" The context omitted from the founding affidavit is that these expenses supported 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. The IT expenses represent 19.3% of revenue (2024) and 6.1% of revenue (2025)\u2014reasonable for a global e-commerce operation. The Applicant fails to disclose the revenue context.\n#### AD 8.10 - International Expenses and Tax Implications\n7.4 The Applicant claims expenses are \"seemingly international\" and accounts have \"almost exceeded the yearly allowable quota for funds leaving South Africa.\" The Shopify platforms were funded by UK company RegimA Zone Ltd (company 10697009). UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The international expenses were legitimate costs of UK-owned e-commerce operations.\n#### AD 9.2 - Bank Message Regarding International Transfers\n7.5 The Applicant references bank messages about international transfers. The actual international payment flow is demonstrated by Shopify invoices: UK entities (RegimA Zone Ltd) funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The payment direction is UK \u2192 SA, not SA \u2192 UK as the Applicant's affidavit implies.\n#### AD 9.3 - Financial Misconduct Summary\n7.6 The Applicant summarizes alleged misconduct. The documented financial misconduct includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) without the Second Respondent's authority; (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments (Annexure **SF3**, **SF5**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments for this stock (SARS audit email, Annexure **SF4**); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023, unpaid despite Ms. Farrar's false claim to me that it was paid (Annexure **JF2**, **SF6**).\n---\n### 8. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1-10.14: APPLICATION TO DECLARE RESPONDENTS DELINQUENT\n#### AD 10.1 - Relief Sought - Delinquency or Probation\n8.1 The Applicant seeks delinquency or probation orders under Section 162. The evidence establishes grounds for the Applicant's own delinquency: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers in breach of fiduciary duty as co-director; (2) Card cancellation sabotage one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation; (3) False statements about UK payment flows; (4) Abuse of ex parte process through material non-disclosures.\n#### AD 10.3 - Delinquent Conduct of Respondents\n8.2 The Applicant alleges delinquent conduct by the Second Respondent and me. My actual conduct included: (1) Fulfilling fiduciary duty as trustee by investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025); (2) Confronting Ms. Farrar about profiting from proceeds of murder; (3) Being deceived by co-trustees into signing \"Main Trustee\" document (11 Aug 2025, Annexure **JF5**); (4) Being punished with interdict two days later (13 Aug 2025, Annexure **JF6**).\n#### AD 10.4 - Contravention of Companies Act\n8.3 The Applicant alleges Companies Act contraventions. Section 76(3)(b) requires directors to act in good faith and for a proper purpose. The Applicant's actions demonstrate bad faith: (1) Manufactured crisis (card cancellation day after cooperation); (2) Material non-disclosures in ex parte application; (3) False statements about UK operations; (4) Systematic sabotage of profitable businesses.\n#### AD 10.5.2 - Probation Relief Under Section 162\n8.4 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence reveals: Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) commissioned this affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths. Mr. Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery of the fraud the Second Respondent reported.\n#### AD 10.6 - Close Corporations Act - Fiduciary Duties\n8.5 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act fiduciary duties. The Act requires members to manage in the corporation's interest. RegimA Skin Treatments (CC) owes R1,035,000 to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023. Strategic Logistics (CC) lost R5.4M in stock that \"disappeared\"\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory. These transactions were not in the corporations' interests.\n#### AD 10.6.1 - Member's Duty to Manage in Corporation's Interest\n8.6 The Applicant cites duty to manage in corporation's interest. The R5.4M stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics represents 46% of annual sales\u201410 times the historical adjustment. Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments. This transaction was not in Strategic Logistics' interest.\n#### AD 10.6.2 - Member's Duty Not to Exceed Powers\n8.7 The Applicant cites duty not to exceed powers. The unauthorized R900,000 transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) were made without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director. The Applicant exceeded his powers by acting unilaterally.\n#### AD 10.6.3 - Member's Duty to Avoid Conflicts of Interest\n8.8 The Applicant cites duty to avoid conflicts. The evidence reveals multiple conflicts: (1) Mr. Bantjies: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant; (2) Ms. Farrar's son (Adderory) supplying stock to RegimA Skin Treatments while same stock type \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) Villa Via (trust-owned) charging 86% profit margin rent to group; (4) Regimaskin.co.za (owned by Ms. Farrar's son) competing with RegimA operations.\n#### AD 10.7 - Member Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n8.9 The Applicant invokes breach of fiduciary duty liability. The breaches are established: (1) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to the Second Respondent (co-director) by unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries (as trustee) by attacking them with interdict; (3) Mr. Bantjies breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries by dismissing audit request and facilitating fraud.\n#### AD 10.7.1.2 - Liability for Economic Benefit Derived\n8.10 The Applicant cites liability for economic benefit. The economic benefits derived include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (4) 86% profit margin on Villa Via rent; (5) Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za (Adderory).\n#### AD 10.7.1.4 - Liability for Loss Suffered by Corporation\n8.11 The Applicant cites liability for corporate loss. The losses suffered include: (1) RegimA SA: R900K unauthorized transfers, revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025, Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025; (2) RegimA Zone: Customer diversion to competing domain, card cancellation sabotage; (3) Strategic Logistics: R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (4) RegimA Worldwide: Forced to pay 2 years of unallocated expenses from all companies.\n#### AD 10.8 - Disqualification for Misconduct Under Section 47\n8.12 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act Section 47 disqualification. This section applies when a member is guilty of gross negligence or fraud. The R5.4M stock adjustment (46% of sales, 10x historical) in Strategic Logistics, with Ms. Farrar claiming Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments, and the same stock type supplied by Adderory, suggests systematic fraud.\n#### AD 10.8.1 - Declaration of Delinquency as Alternative Relief\n8.13 The Applicant seeks delinquency declaration. The evidence supports declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5): (1) Intentional harm to companies (systematic sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent conduct (card cancellation without notice); (3) Breach of trust (attacking beneficiaries as trustee); (4) Abuse of process (ex parte order based on material non-disclosures and false statements).\n#### AD 10.9 - Mandatory Disqualification Under Section 162(5)\n8.14 The Applicant invokes Section 162(5) mandatory disqualification grounds. These grounds apply to the Applicant's conduct: (1) Intentional harm to companies (R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent harm (card cancellation rendering documentation inaccessible); (3) Breach of trust (trustee attacking beneficiaries).\n#### AD 10.9.2 - Intentional or Grossly Negligent Harm\n8.15 The Applicant alleges intentional or grossly negligent harm by respondents. The intentional harm was inflicted by the Applicant and his co-conspirators: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent cooperates; (2) 7 June: Cards cancelled; (3) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days after my inquiry); (4) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days after my inquiry); (5) 8 July: Warehouse sabotaged; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action followed either my debt inquiry or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure.\n#### AD 10.9.3 - Manner of Acting - Gross Negligence or Misconduct\n8.16 The Applicant alleges gross negligence or misconduct. The gross negligence is demonstrated by: Cancelling 15 business cards without notice, rendering documentation inaccessible, then complaining about missing documentation. This demonstrates consciousness of guilt and bad faith.\n#### AD 10.9.3.1 - Gross Negligence or Wilful Misconduct\n8.17 The Applicant alleges wilful misconduct. The wilful misconduct includes: (1) Systematic revenue diversion (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (2) Data destruction (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Card sabotage (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). This six-month campaign occurred after I investigated fraud and the Second Respondent exposed fraud.\n#### AD 10.9.3.2 - Acquiescence to Fraudulent Acts\n8.18 The Applicant alleges acquiescence to fraud. The acquiescence to fraud includes: (1) Two years of unallocated expenses while Ms. Farrar controlled systems using the Applicant's email and Linda was employed as bookkeeper; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" with Mr. Bantjies allegedly instructing payments; (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate unpaid since Feb 2023; (4) Villa Via 86% profit margin rent extraction.\n#### AD 10.9.3.3 - Party to Omission with Fraudulent Purpose\n8.19 The Applicant alleges omission with fraudulent purpose. The omissions with fraudulent purpose include: (1) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's trustee status from affidavit; (2) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Applicant omitted R34.9M revenue context for IT expenses; (4) Applicant omitted UK \u2192 SA payment flow (claimed opposite); (5) Applicant omitted timeline showing card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation; (6) Applicant omitted my debt inquiry and subsequent retaliation.\n#### AD 10.10 - Probation Under Section 162(7)\n8.20 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162(7). This section applies when conduct is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) I fulfilled fiduciary duty by investigating debt, then was punished with interdict; (2) Second Respondent exposed fraud to accountant, then suffered six-month sabotage campaign; (3) Both excluded from profitable businesses we built.\n#### AD 10.10.2.3 - Oppressive or Prejudicial Exercise of Powers\n8.21 The Applicant alleges oppressive exercise of powers. The oppressive exercise of powers includes: (1) Applicant used trustee powers to attack beneficiaries; (2) Mr. Bantjies used trustee powers to dismiss audit request and facilitate fraud; (3) Applicant used director powers to make unauthorized R900K transfers; (4) Applicant used court process to obtain ex parte order based on material non-disclosures.\n#### AD 10.10.2.4 - Conduct with Oppressive or Prejudicial Result\n8.22 The Applicant alleges conduct with prejudicial result. The prejudicial results include: (1) I was excluded from companies after investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent excluded from R34.9M operations he built; (3) Customers diverted to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son; (4) R900K transferred without authorization; (5) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (6) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate unpaid.\n#### AD 10.10.22 - Business Conducted in Oppressive Manner\n8.23 The Applicant alleges oppressive business conduct. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled all systems using Applicant's email while claiming to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions; (2) Applicant had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems; (3) Two years of expenses unallocated despite employed bookkeeper; (4) Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) dismissed fraud investigation.\n#### AD 10.10.41 - Conduct Inconsistent with Duties\n8.24 The Applicant alleges conduct inconsistent with duties. The conduct inconsistent with duties includes: (1) Trustee attacking beneficiaries (Applicant, Mr. Bantjies); (2) Director making unauthorized transfers (Applicant); (3) Trustee dismissing fraud investigation (Mr. Bantjies); (4) Accountant facilitating fraud while being debtor (Mr. Bantjies); (5) Administrator controlling systems while diverting revenue (Ms. Farrar).\n#### AD 10.13 - Unaccounted Money - Significant Sums\n8.25 The Applicant alleges unaccounted money. The unaccounted money includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023; (4) R1.73 million transferred 11 Sep 2025; (5) Two years of unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide on 30 Mar 2025.\n#### AD 10.14 - Full Extent of Transgressions Not Yet Determined\n8.26 The Applicant claims full extent not yet determined. The full extent includes: (1) Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email; (4) Ms. Farrar's son's competing domain; (5) Adderory's stock supply relationship; (6) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme; (7) Court order seizing Kayla's email during law enforcement investigation.\n---\n### 9. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 11.2-12.4: UK OPERATIONS AND ALLEGED FRAUD\n#### AD 11.2 - UK Head Office - RegimA UK Ltd\n9.1 The Applicant describes UK operations. RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The UK company is the economic owner of the e-commerce operations.\n#### AD 11.3 - Directors of UK Entity\n9.2 The Applicant describes UK directors. The UK company was established by the Second Respondent and Kayla to own and operate the global e-commerce platforms. After Kayla's murder (13 July 2023), the Second Respondent continued managing the operations.\n#### AD 11.4 - Applicant's Role in Operations\n9.3 The Applicant describes his role. The evidence demonstrates the Applicant had no operational role: (1) No access to email (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (4) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's. The Applicant appears to be a figurehead.\n#### AD 11.6 - UK Branch Operations\n9.4 The Applicant describes UK branch operations. The UK company funded SA operations through Shopify subscription payments. Shopify invoices demonstrate UK \u2192 SA payment flow of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The UK company invested in SA operations, not the reverse.\n#### AD 11.8 - UK Financial Concerns\n9.5 The Applicant expresses UK financial concerns. The financial concerns were manufactured: (1) Card cancellation 7 June 2025 disrupted UK funding; (2) Domain theft 29 May 2025 diverted customers; (3) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 destroyed UK-funded operations; (4) Data expungement 22 May 2025 eliminated audit trail.\n#### AD 12.1 - UK Branch Non-Payment and Fraud Concerns\n9.6 The Applicant alleges UK branch non-payment and fraud. The Shopify invoices prove the opposite: UK entities funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). UK bank transactions corroborate the invoices (Annexure **DF8**). The Applicant's statement is demonstrably false.\n#### AD 12.2 - Misappropriation Leading to Insolvency Risk\n9.7 The Applicant alleges misappropriation leading to insolvency. The actual insolvency risk was created by: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (3) Data expungement (22 May); (4) Card cancellation (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). Despite six months of sabotage, the Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied.\n#### AD 12.3 - Purpose of Court Application\n9.8 The Applicant states the purpose is to prevent further harm. The actual purpose appears to be: (1) Punish me for investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May); (2) Punish Second Respondent for exposing Villa Via fraud (6 June); (3) Seize control of R34.9M operations Second Respondent built; (4) Prevent forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and the systematic fraud.\n#### AD 12.4 - Alternative Roles for Wife and Son\n9.9 The Applicant suggests alternative roles for the Second Respondent and me. The evidence demonstrates: (1) I fulfilled trustee duties by investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent built and managed R34.9M profitable operations; (3) Both were systematically sabotaged after investigating/exposing fraud; (4) Both were attacked with interdict by co-trustees; (5) I was included in interdict two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document.\n---\n### 10. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 13.2-13.8: REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERDICTORY RELIEF\n#### AD 13.2 - Clear Right Not to Be Prejudiced\n10.1 The Applicant claims clear right not to be prejudiced. The Applicant has no clear right: (1) He manufactured the crisis (card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (2) He made unauthorized R900K transfers; (3) He had alternative remedies as trustee with \"additional powers\"; (4) He obtained order through material non-disclosures (Mr. Bantjies's trustee status, debtor status, timeline manipulation, UK payment flow misrepresentation).\n#### AD 13.2.2 - Injury Sustained and Apprehension of Further Harm\n10.2 The Applicant claims injury and apprehension of harm. The Applicant suffered no injury he didn't inflict on himself: (1) Card cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible; (2) Unauthorized transfers depleted accounts; (3) Revenue diversions reduced cash flow; (4) Warehouse sabotage destroyed operations. The apprehension of further harm was manufactured to justify ex parte relief.\n#### AD 13.3 - Reasonable Apprehension of Irreparable Harm\n10.3 The Applicant claims reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm. The irreparable harm was inflicted by the Applicant's six-month sabotage campaign: (1) R34.9M operations destroyed (93.3% revenue collapse); (2) Customer relationships diverted to competing domain; (3) Audit data expunged (100% loss); (4) Documentation rendered inaccessible; (5) Accounts emptied. The Second Respondent and I suffered irreparable harm, not the Applicant.\n#### AD 13.4 - Interdicts Essential for Corporation Survival\n10.4 The Applicant claims interdicts essential for survival. The corporations were profitable under the Second Respondent's management (R34.9M annually). The survival threat came from the Applicant's sabotage: (1) Unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data destruction; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Excluding the Second Respondent and me threatened survival, not ensured it.\n#### AD 13.5 - Balance of Convenience Favours Granting Relief\n10.5 The Applicant claims balance of convenience favors relief. The balance overwhelmingly favors the Second Respondent and me: (1) We built and managed profitable operations; (2) We investigated and exposed fraud; (3) We were systematically sabotaged for doing so; (4) We substituted personal cards to prevent business collapse; (5) We support independent forensic audit. The Applicant obtained relief through material non-disclosures and false statements.\n#### AD 13.8 - Other Relief Sought in Part A\n10.6 The Applicant seeks additional relief. The relief was obtained ex parte based on: (1) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Omitting timeline showing card cancellation day after cooperation; (4) Falsely claiming UK owes SA (opposite is true); (5) Omitting R34.9M revenue context; (6) Omitting my debt inquiry and retaliation pattern.\n---\n### 11. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1-14.5: FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND FORENSIC AUDIT\n#### AD 14.1 - Financial Constraints on Respondents\n11.1 The Applicant seeks financial constraints on the Second Respondent and me. The financial constraints were already imposed through sabotage: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Despite six months of sabotage, the Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors.\n#### AD 14.3 - Constraint to Prevent Financial Prejudice\n11.2 The Applicant seeks constraints to prevent prejudice. The prejudice was inflicted by the Applicant: (1) RegimA SA account opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 (Feb-Mar 2025); (2) 169 customer deposits R566,598.57 proving active trade; (3) R1.73M transferred 11 Sep 2025; (4) R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage.\n#### AD 14.4 - Forensic Audit Necessity and Remuneration\n11.3 The Applicant seeks forensic audit. The Second Respondent and I support independent forensic audit by an impartial party. Such audit would reveal: (1) Mr. Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant); (2) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme (Strategic Logistics \u2192 Adderory \u2192 RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (4) Two years unallocated expenses; (5) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (6) Revenue diversion scheme; (7) Ms. Farrar's control of systems using Applicant's email.\n#### AD 14.5 - Request for Relief Under Part B\n11.4 The Applicant requests Part B relief. The relief should include: (1) Setting aside ex parte order obtained through material non-disclosures; (2) Independent forensic audit; (3) Investigation of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts; (4) Investigation of R5.4M stock \"disappearance\"; (5) Recovery of R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (6) Investigation of Ms. Farrar's control and Adderory's role; (7) Consideration of Applicant's delinquency under Section 162(5).\n---\n### 12. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1-16.12: DISCOVERY AND URGENCY\n#### AD 16.1 - Discovery of Respondents' Conduct\n12.1 The Applicant claims discovery of conduct in mid-June 2025. The actual discovery timeline: (1) 15 May: I discovered R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (2) 6 June: Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies; (3) 7 June: Applicant cancelled cards (day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (4) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed audit request. The Applicant's \"discovery\" was actually consciousness of guilt after the Second Respondent exposed fraud to Mr. Bantjies.\n#### AD 16.2 - R600,000 Transfer as Trigger for Action\n12.2 The Applicant cites R600,000 transfer (later corrected to R500,000) as trigger. The actual triggers were: (1) 15 May: I confronted Ms. Farrar about R1,035,000 debt and \"profiting from proceeds of murder\"; (2) 6 June: Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed audit request. The R500,000 transfer is a pretext.\n#### AD 16.5 - Unawareness of Urgent Application Process\n12.3 The Applicant claims unawareness of urgent process. The Applicant had access to legal advice and Mr. Bantjies as Commissioner of Oaths. The delay from mid-June to August contradicts urgency. The actual urgency appears to be preventing forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and systematic fraud.\n#### AD 16.6 - Delay Would Have Been Avoided\n12.4 The Applicant claims delay would have been avoided if he knew the process. The two-month delay (mid-June to August) contradicts urgency. The timing suggests: (1) Waiting to see if Second Respondent's audit request would proceed; (2) Coordinating with Mr. Bantjies (who dismissed audit request 10 June); (3) Preparing my punishment (included in interdict 13 Aug, two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document 11 Aug).\n#### AD 16.8 - State of Shock and Delayed Response\n12.5 The Applicant claims state of shock. The Applicant was not in shock\u2014he was executing a systematic sabotage campaign: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping; (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 7 Jun: Card cancellation; (6) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (7) 11 Sep: Account emptying. This is not shock\u2014this is systematic execution.\n#### AD 16.10 - Attorney Consultation Timeline\n12.6 The Applicant describes attorney consultation. The consultation occurred after: (1) My debt inquiry (15 May); (2) Data expungement (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June); (5) Card cancellation (7 June); (6) Mr. Bantjies's audit dismissal (10 June). The legal action was retaliation, not discovery.\n#### AD 16.12 - Need for Urgent Court Assistance\n12.7 The Applicant claims need for urgent assistance. The Applicant had alternative remedies: (1) Trustee with \"additional powers\" as Founder; (2) Could have conducted audit as trustee; (3) Could have consulted with co-trustee (me) instead of attacking me; (4) Could have consulted with co-trustee Mr. Bantjies (who was facilitating the fraud). The Applicant chose ex parte process to avoid disclosure of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and systematic sabotage.\n---\n### 13. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 17.3-17.4: EX PARTE BASIS\n#### AD 17.3 - Ex Parte Basis for Application\n13.1 The Applicant justifies ex parte application. The ex parte process was abused through material non-disclosures: (1) Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Timeline manipulation (card cancellation day after cooperation); (4) UK payment flow misrepresentation (claimed SA \u2192 UK, actually UK \u2192 SA); (5) R34.9M revenue context omission; (6) My debt inquiry and retaliation pattern; (7) Second Respondent's fraud exposure and retaliation pattern; (8) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email; (9) Adderory's competing domain; (10) R5.4M stock \"disappearance.\"\n#### AD 17.4 - Urgency Justifies Ex Parte Relief\n13.2 The Applicant claims urgency justifies ex parte relief. The urgency was manufactured: (1) Two-month delay contradicts urgency; (2) Card cancellation day after cooperation shows consciousness of guilt; (3) Systematic sabotage from Feb-Sep shows premeditation; (4) I was included two days after signing document, showing coordination; (5) Alternative remedies available as trustee. The ex parte relief was obtained to prevent the Second Respondent and me from exposing the material non-disclosures and systematic fraud.\n---\n### 14. RESPONSE TO REMAINING AD PARAGRAPHS (18.3, 20, 22, 40.9.4, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, 88)\n#### AD 18.3 - Continual Unauthorized Fund Transfers\n14.1 The Applicant alleges continual unauthorized transfers. The unauthorized transfers were made by the Applicant: R450,000 on 14 Feb 2025 + R450,000 on 15 Feb 2025 = R900,000 total from RegimA SA without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director. RegimA SA account: opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 within one month despite 169 customer deposits R566,598.57.\n#### AD 20 - First and Second Respondent Details\n14.2 The Applicant provides the Second Respondent's and my details.

The gross abuse includes: (1) Applicant made R900K unauthorized transfers as director; (2) Applicant cancelled cards without notice as director; (3) Applicant used trustee position to attack beneficiaries; (4) Mr. Bantjies used trustee position to dismiss audit and facilitate fraud; (5) Ms. Farrar used administrative position to control systems, divert revenue, and facilitate son's competing domain.\n#### AD 44 - Applicant Identity Details\n14.5 The Applicant confirms identity. The Applicant's actual position: (1) No access to email (pete@regima.com controlled by Ms. Farrar); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (4) Debtor to Mr. Bantjies (R18.685M due May 2026); (5) Figurehead while Ms. Farrar claims to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions.\n#### AD 50 - Registered Address Details\n14.6 The Applicant provides address: 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview. This is also my address. The Applicant attacked me (co-trustee, beneficiary) with interdict two days after I signed \"Main Trustee\" document, punishing me for investigating R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate and supporting the Second Respondent.\n#### AD 74 - Timeline Context\n14.7 The Applicant provides timeline context. The actual timeline: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping (12-hour deadline); (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 15 May: My debt inquiry; (6) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days later); (7) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days later); (8) 6 Jun: Second Respondent's fraud exposure; (9) 7 Jun: Cards cancelled (1 day later); (10) 10 Jun: Audit dismissed; (11) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotaged; (12) 11 Aug: I sign document; (13) 13 Aug: I included in interdict (2 days later); (14) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied.\n#### AD 78 - Accountant's Office Visit and Discovery\n14.8 The Applicant describes Mr. Bantjies's office visit. The visit occurred after: (1) Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025; (2) Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) Applicant cancelled cards on 7 June 2025 (day after Second Respondent's cooperation). Mr. Bantjies \"discovered\" irregularities after the Second Respondent reported fraud to him. Mr. Bantjies then dismissed audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\"\n#### AD 83 - Irregular Payments Discovery\n14.9 The Applicant describes discovery of irregular payments. The irregular payments include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers by Applicant (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics (same type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments (SARS audit email); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023 (Ms. Farrar falsely claimed paid to me on 15 May 2025).\n#### AD 88 - Follow-up Actions\n14.10 The Applicant describes follow-up actions. The follow-up actions include: (1) 7 Jun: Card cancellation (day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (2) 10 Jun: Mr. Bantjies dismisses audit; (3) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (4) 11 Aug: I was deceived into signing document; (5) 13 Aug: I was included in interdict; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action was retaliation against me (15 May debt inquiry) and the Second Respondent (6 Jun fraud exposure).\n---\n### 15. PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n15.1 I respectfully request that this Honourable Court:\n15.1.1 Set aside the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025 on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n15.1.2 Dismiss the Applicant's application for delinquency or probation orders against the Second Respondent and me.\n15.1.3 Grant a counter-application declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008, on the grounds of:\n- Intentional harm to companies through systematic sabotage;\n- Grossly negligent conduct in card cancellation without notice;\n- Breach of fiduciary duty to beneficiaries as trustee;\n- Abuse of court process through material non-disclosures and false statements.\n15.1.4 Order an independent forensic audit by an impartial auditor to investigate:\n- Mr. Bantjies's conflicts of interest (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant);\n- R5.4 million stock transfer pricing scheme;\n- R1,035,000 debt to Kayla Pretorius's estate;\n- Two years of unallocated expenses;\n- Unauthorized R900,000 transfers;\n- Revenue diversion scheme;\n- Ms. Farrar's control of systems and Adderory's role.\n15.1.5 Order the Applicant to pay the costs of this application on the scale as between attorney and client.\n15.1.6 Grant such further and/or alternative relief as this Honourable Court deems fit.\n---\n### 16. CONCLUSION\n16.1 The evidence presented in this affidavit demonstrates that I fulfilled my fiduciary duties as a trustee by investigating a substantial debt owed to a deceased beneficiary's estate. I confronted Ms. Farrar about this debt on 15 May 2025, stating that keeping the funds would constitute profiting from the proceeds of murder.\n16.2 Within seven days of my inquiry, Shopify data was expunged, eliminating the audit trail. Within 14 days, a competing domain was registered by Ms. Farrar's son's company, diverting customers from the Second Respondent's operations.\n16.3 On 11 August 2025, I was deceived by my co-trustees into signing a \"Main Trustee\" document that backdated the Applicant's designation to 1 July 2025. Two days later, on 13 August 2025, the Applicant and Mr. Bantjies included me in this interdict.\n16.4 The ex parte order was obtained through material non-disclosures, including Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status, his R18.685 million debt to the trust, the timeline showing card cancellation one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation, false statements about UK payment flows, and the omission of the R34.9 million revenue context.\n16.5 The Second Respondent and I support an independent forensic audit by an impartial party. Such an audit would reveal the systematic fraud, conflicts of interest, and abuse of process that underlie this application.\n16.6 I respectfully submit that the balance of convenience overwhelmingly favors setting aside the ex parte order and granting the relief sought in this affidavit.\n---\n**SIGNED at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025.**\n---\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**  \nFirst Respondent\n---\n**THUS SIGNED AND SWORN TO before me at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025, the Deponent having acknowledged that she knows and understands the contents of this Affidavit, that she has no objection to taking the prescribed oath, and that she considers the oath to be binding on her conscience.**\n---\n**COMMISSIONER OF OATHS**\n---\n## LIST OF ANNEXURES\n**JF1:** Trust deed and trustee documentation  \n**JF2:** Email correspondence re R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025)  \n**JF3:** Rynette's false statement documentation  \n**JF4:** Domain registration records (regimaskin.co.za, 29 May 2025)  \n**JF5:** \"Main Trustee\" document (signed 11 Aug 2025, backdated to 1 July 2025)  \n**JF6:** Interdict order (13 Aug 2025)  \n**JF7:** Personal card statements (substitution to prevent collapse)  \n**JF8:** Email from Gee re domain diversion (20 June 2025)\n**DF1:** Shopify operations overview (51+ stores, R34.9M revenue)  \n**DF2:** Villa Via fraud analysis (86% profit margin)  \n**DF3:** Email correspondence with Bantjies (6 June 2025)  \n**DF4:** Card cancellation records (7 June 2025)  \n**DF5-DF7:** Shopify invoices (UK \u2192 SA payment flow, R84,661+ annually)  \n**DF8:** UK bank transactions (corroborating Shopify payments)  \n**DF9:** Unauthorized transfer records (R450K + R450K = R900K, 14-15 Feb 2025)  \n**DF10:** RegimA SA account statements (opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08)  \n**DF11:** Customer deposit records (169 deposits, R566,598.57)  \n**DF12:** Revenue diversion documentation (1 Mar, 14 Apr, 11 Sep 2025)  \n**DF13:** Warehouse sabotage instruction (8 July 2025)  \n**DF14:** Expense dumping documentation (30 Mar 2025)\n**SF1:** Bantjies debt documentation (R18.685M, investment payout schedule)  \n**SF2:** Sage screenshots (Rynette using pete@regima.com, June & Aug 2025)  \n**SF3:** Strategic Logistics R5.4M stock adjustment documentation  \n**SF4:** SARS audit email (Rynette claiming Bantjies instructed payments)  \n**SF5:** Adderory company registration and stock supply documentation  \n**SF6:** Kayla Pretorius estate documentation (R1,035,000 debt)  \n**SF7:** Court order seizing Kayla's email account  \n**SF8:** Linda employment records (bookkeeper)\n---\n**END OF AFFIDAVIT**",

fraud\n4.The Ex Parte Deception: Material non-disclosures and false statements\n5.The Manufactured Crisis: Peter created the problems he complains about\n6.The Truth: UK funded SA (not vice versa), IT expenses reasonable for R34.9M operations\nThe narrative allows connections to become self-evident through gradual revelation, maintaining professional tone while building an irrefutable case through documentary evidence.\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nSent: Sunday, 02 November 2025 21:38\nTo: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nSubject: Re: AD NOTES -

manufactured crisis\n- Section 76(3)(b) of Companies Act - bad faith and improper purpose\n- Section 162(5) of Companies Act - grounds for Peter's delinquency\n- Section 9(1) of Trust Property Control Act - trustee duties\n- Requirements for interdictory relief (clear right, harm, balance of convenience)\n### Strategic Recommendations\n- Emphasize manufactured crisis argument\n- Highlight retaliation pattern\n- Leverage Shopify invoice evidence for perjury\n- Support independent forensic audit\n- Pursue counter-application for Peter's delinquency\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nSent: Saturday, 01 November 2025 14:30\nTo: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.com>; Daniel Faucitt <d@rzo.io>; regizone <regizone@proton.me>\nSubject: AD NOTES - JACQUELINE FAUCITT \n## ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT: JACQUELINE FAUCITT\n**IN THE HIGH COURT OF SOUTH AFRICA**  \n**GAUTENG DIVISION, PRETORIA**\n**Case No:** 2025-137857\n**In the matter between:**\n**PETER ANDREW FAUCITT** \u2014 Applicant\nand\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT** \u2014 First Respondent  \n**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT** \u2014 Second Respondent  \n*(and others)*\n---\n## I, THE UNDERSIGNED\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**\ndo hereby make oath and state that:\n---\n### 1. INTRODUCTION AND CAPACITY\n1.1 I am the First Respondent in this matter, an adult female, and a South African citizen residing at 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview.\n1.2 I am a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust (IT 3651/2013) and a Beneficiary of the same trust. I am also a co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (2017/087935/07) and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (2011/005722/07), both of which are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust.\n1.3 The facts deposed to in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and belief, save where the context indicates otherwise, and are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\n1.4 Where I make legal submissions, I do so on the advice of my legal representatives.\n---\n### 2. PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT\n2.1 This affidavit is filed in response to the Applicant's founding affidavit and the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025.\n2.2 I oppose the relief sought by the Applicant and seek to have the ex parte order set aside on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n2.3 I address each of the Applicant's allegations in the order they appear in the founding affidavit, following the AD paragraph sequence.\n---\n### 3. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 1-3.13: PARTIES AND STRUCTURE\n#### AD 1 - Director Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n3.1 The Applicant invokes provisions relating to director liability for breach of fiduciary duty. I note that the accounting system used to track the alleged breaches was controlled by Rynette Farrar using the Applicant's email address (pete@regima.com), as evidenced by Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 (Annexure **SF2**). The Applicant himself had no access to this system.\n#### AD 1.3 - Applicant's Personal Details and Declaration\n3.2 The Applicant's personal details are noted. I observe that this affidavit was commissioned by Danie Jacobus Bantjies, identified as \"our accountant.\" The full extent of Mr. Bantjies's roles will become apparent through the evidence presented herein.\n#### AD 2 - Company Business Conduct Requirements\n3.3 The Applicant alleges reckless or grossly negligent business conduct. The financial performance of the companies demonstrates the contrary. The Second Respondent and his late partner, Kayla Pretorius, built 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. RegimA SA operates 25 stores with R8.5 million turnover, while RegimA Zone operates 26 stores with R26.4 million turnover. The businesses were highly profitable under the Second Respondent's management.\n#### AD 2.4 - Parties to the Application - Introduction\n3.4 The Applicant introduces the parties. The corporate structure reveals that certain entities are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust, which has three trustees. Two are identified in the founding affidavit: the Applicant and myself. The third trustee's identity was not disclosed to the beneficiaries until recently.\n#### AD 3 - Court Order for Probation of Directors/Members\n3.5 The Applicant seeks probation orders under Section 162 of the Companies Act. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence will demonstrate that the accountant who allegedly \"discovered\" the irregularities has multiple undisclosed roles that create impermissible conflicts.\n#### AD 3.2 - Respondents - Wife\n3.6 I am correctly identified as the Applicant's wife and First Respondent. On 15 May 2025, I confronted Rynette Farrar regarding a debt of R1,035,000 owed by RegimA Skin Treatments CC to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd since February 2023 (Annexure **JF2**). These funds were part of Kayla Pretorius's estate. I informed Ms. Farrar that keeping these funds would constitute profiting from the proceeds of murder. This confrontation proved significant in the events that followed.\n#### AD 3.4 - Respondents - Son\n3.7 The Second Respondent is correctly identified as the Applicant's son. On 6 June 2025, the Second Respondent cooperated with the Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports to the accountant regarding Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC, which is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust (Annexure **DF3**). The Second Respondent unknowingly reported fraud to one of the perpetrators.\n#### AD 3.4.2 - Third Respondent - RegimA Skin Treatments\n3.8 RegimA Skin Treatments CC (B1992/005371/23) owes R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, part of Kayla Pretorius's estate, since February 2023. When I raised this debt on 15 May 2025, Ms. Farrar claimed it was paid\u2014a statement I have since determined to be false. RegimA Skin Treatments receives stock from Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure **SF5**).\n#### AD 3.6 - Fourth Respondent - Regim A UK\n3.9 RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). This contradicts claims made later in the founding affidavit regarding UK entities owing money to SA operations.\n#### AD 3.6.1 - Fifth Respondent - Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC\n3.10 Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC (1996/004451/23) is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. Financial analysis reveals an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group\u2014an excessive profit extraction (Annexure **DF2**). This was the fraud the Second Respondent reported to the accountant on 6 June 2025.\n#### AD 3.6.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Villa Via Arcadia\n3.11 Property registration confirms trust ownership. The trust has three trustees, but only two were known to the beneficiaries at the time of this application.\n#### AD 3.7 - Sixth Respondent - Strategic Logistics CC\n3.12 Strategic Logistics CC (2008/136496/23) experienced a R5.4 million stock adjustment in 2024\u2014stock that allegedly \"just disappeared\" (Annexure **SF3**). This represents 46% of annual sales (R5.4M on R11.3M sales) and is 10 times the prior year's adjustment. The stock type matches inventory supplied by Adderory (Pty) Ltd to RegimA Skin Treatments.\n#### AD 3.7.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Strategic Logistics\n3.13 Property registration documents are noted. In a SARS audit email concerning the R5.4M stock adjustment, Ms. Farrar claimed that Danie Bantjies instructed her to make the substantial payments related to this transaction (Annexure **SF4**).\n#### AD 3.8 - Seventh Respondent - FirstRand Bank (FNB)\n3.14 FNB holds accounts for the companies. On 14 and 15 February 2025, unauthorized transfers of R450,000 each (R900,000 total) were made from RegimA SA's FNB account without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director (Annexure **DF9**). The account opened with R997,597.94 and closed at R5,284.08 within one month, despite 169 customer deposits totaling R566,598.57 proving active trade (Annexure **DF10**, **DF11**).\n#### AD 3.9 - Eighth and Ninth Respondents\n3.15 ABSA Bank and CIPC are cited. Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution began with an ABSA bank letter dated 14 April 2025 (Annexure **DF12**).\n#### AD 3.11 - Reference to Respondents as Wife and Son\n3.16 The Applicant refers to the Second Respondent and me as \"my wife\" and \"my son.\" Both of us are beneficiaries of the Faucitt Family Trust. I am also a co-trustee. The Trust Property Control Act, 57 of 1988, Section 9(1) requires trustees to act with care, diligence, and skill in the interests of beneficiaries.\n#### AD 3.13 - Court Jurisdiction and Identity Confirmation\n3.17 Jurisdiction is confirmed. The affidavit was commissioned by Danie Bantjies, who signed as \"Commissioner of Oaths.\" Mr. Bantjies's accounting firm is \"Bantjes and Company.\" His full relationship to the trust and companies will be revealed through the evidence presented herein.\n---\n### 4. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTANT DETAILS - BANTJIES CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n#### AD 4 - Accountant Details - Bantjes and Company\n4.1 The Applicant identifies \"our accountant\" as Danie Jacobus Bantjies of \"Bantjes and Company,\" who attended the office in mid-June 2025. What the Applicant does not disclose are the following material facts:\n4.1.1 Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust\u2014a status that was unknown to the beneficiaries, the Second Respondent and myself, until recently.\n4.1.2 Mr. Bantjies is a debtor to the trust, owing R18.685 million on an investment payout schedule with payments due in May 2026, May 2027, and May 2029 (Annexure **SF1**).\n4.1.3 Mr. Bantjies controls the financial systems and gave instructions to Ms. Farrar for multi-million rand transactions, as evidenced by emails (Annexure **SF4**).\n4.1.4 Mr. Bantjies was \"running the companies\" when the Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud on 6 June 2025.\n4.1.5 Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\"\n4.2 This creates an impermissible conflict of interest: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant + Company Controller. Mr. Bantjies had a direct financial interest in preventing discovery of the fraud the Second Respondent reported.\n---\n### 5. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1-6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE\n#### AD 6.1 - Relationships Between Parties\n5.1 The Applicant describes family and corporate relationships. The evidence demonstrates a different control structure. Ms. Farrar controlled all bank accounts (the Applicant had no access), controlled the Sage accounting system using the Applicant's email (pete@regima.com), and claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions rather than the Applicant's (Annexure **SF2**). Ms. Farrar's sister, Linda, was employed as bookkeeper, yet two years of expenses remained unallocated until 30 March 2025 (Annexure **SF8**).\n#### AD 6.3 - Directors and Members of Respondent Entities\n5.2 The Applicant describes directorships. The Second Respondent and I are co-directors of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd. RegimA Worldwide Distribution is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. On 30 March 2025, Ms. Farrar and the Applicant dumped two years of unallocated expenses into RegimA Worldwide Distribution and demanded the Second Respondent sign off within 12 hours for SARS VAT and Annual Accounts (Annexure **DF14**). The Second Respondent used this deadline extension (until 6 June) to finalize reports and uncover the Villa Via fraud.\n#### AD 6.5 - Banking and Registration of Respondent Entities\n5.3 The Applicant describes banking arrangements. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to any bank accounts; (2) Ms. Farrar controlled all accounts; (3) Revenue diversion for RegimA SA started 1 March 2025; (4) Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution started 14 April 2025 (ABSA bank letter); (5) On 11 September 2025, R1.73 million was transferred from accounts (Annexure **DF12**).\n---\n### 6. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7-7.20: URGENCY AND ALLEGED MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 7 - Urgency and Delay Considerations\n6.1 The Applicant claims urgency. The timeline reveals: (1) Alleged discovery mid-June 2025; (2) Application filed August 2025; (3) Two-month delay contradicts urgency. The actual urgency relates to the Second Respondent's fraud exposure on 6 June and my debt inquiry on 15 May.\n#### AD 7.3 - Urgency Details\n6.2 The Applicant claims the accountant noted \"numerous discrepancies\" and \"irregular payments\" in mid-June 2025. Timeline analysis reveals: 6 June 2025 (Second Respondent provides comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies), 7 June 2025 (Applicant cancels 15 UK business cards without notice). The card cancellation occurred one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation, not \"following\" any discovery. This demonstrates that the Applicant created the problem he now complains about.\n#### AD 7.6 - Financial Impact of Misconduct\n6.3 The Applicant alleges financial impact. The actual financial sabotage included: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) Revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025; (3) Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025 (100% audit data loss, seven days after my confrontation with Ms. Farrar); (4) Card cancellation 7 June 2025; (5) Domain theft 29 May 2025 (regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory, 14 days after my confrontation, Annexure **JF4**); (6) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 (R34.9M operations destroyed).\n#### AD 7.8 - Continuing Harm to Corporations\n6.4 The Applicant claims continuing harm. The harm was systematically inflicted. An email from Gee dated 20 June 2025 states she was instructed to send a \"don't use regima.zone only use regimaskin.co.za\" email (Annexure **JF8**). The domain regimaskin.co.za is owned by Adderory (Pty) Ltd (Ms. Farrar's son's company), not by RegimA. This diverted customers from the Second Respondent's platforms to a competing domain controlled by Ms. Farrar's family.\n#### AD 7.10 - Card Cancellations and Service Interruptions\n6.5 The Applicant claims he cancelled cards in June 2025 \"following\" the accountant's discovery and requested invoices from the Second Respondent. Timeline evidence demonstrates: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent provides comprehensive reports; (2) 7 June: Applicant cancels UK cards (5191, 5225) paying for Shopify subscriptions (Annexure **DF4**); (3) Cards cancelled one day after cooperation, not after any discovery. The cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible (card-based authentication), then the Applicant complained about missing documentation.\n#### AD 7.13 - Domain and Service Halts Due to Card Cancellations\n6.6 The Applicant claims subscriptions were halted due to card cancellations. To prevent business collapse, the Second Respondent substituted his personal card (1927) for RegimA SA and I substituted my personal card (3212) for RegimA Zone (Annexure **JF7**). Meanwhile, the competing domain regimaskin.co.za was actively diverting customers.\n#### AD 7.16 - Son's Interference with Business Operations\n6.7 The Applicant alleges the Second Respondent interfered with operations. The evidence demonstrates the Second Respondent built and managed 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually (Annexure **DF1**). The Second Respondent's partner, Kayla Pretorius, co-built these operations before her murder on 13 July 2023. After Kayla's death, a court order was obtained to seize her email account (kayp@rzo.io), which interfered with a law enforcement investigation that had instructed a freeze on the account (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.18 - Email and Account Access Interference\n6.8 The Applicant claims the Second Respondent restricted email access. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to his own email (pete@regima.com)\u2014controlled by Ms. Farrar; (2) Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 show Ms. Farrar using the Applicant's email (Annexure **SF2**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's; (4) Kayla's email was seized by court order after her murder (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.20 - Continued Interference Not in Corporate Interests\n6.9 The Applicant claims interference is not in corporate interests. The corporate interests were served by the Second Respondent's profitable operations (R34.9M annually). The interference came from: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Domain theft; (6) Warehouse sabotage. Each action occurred after either my debt inquiry (15 May) or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June).\n---\n### 7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 8.4-9.3: FINANCIAL DISCREPANCIES AND MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 8.4 - Discovery of Financial Discrepancies\n7.1 The Applicant claims the accountant discovered discrepancies. The accountant, Mr. Bantjies, is also: (1) Undisclosed trustee; (2) Debtor owing R18.685M; (3) Controller of financial systems; (4) Recipient of the Second Respondent's fraud report on 6 June 2025. Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025. The \"discovery\" occurred after the Second Respondent exposed fraud to the person facilitating it.\n#### AD 8.5 - Accountant's Attendance and Findings\n7.2 The Applicant states Mr. Bantjies attended for provisional tax and VAT submissions. The two years of unallocated expenses (dumped into RegimA Worldwide Distribution on 30 March 2025) occurred while: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled the accounting system using the Applicant's email; (2) Linda (Ms. Farrar's sister) was employed as bookkeeper (Annexure **SF8**); (3) Mr. Bantjies was the accountant. The question arises: why were expenses unallocated for two years if the accountant and bookkeeper were performing their duties?\n#### AD 8.7 - IT Expenses and Tax Problems\n7.3 The Applicant cites IT expenses: 2024 tax year R6,738,007.47; 2025 tax year R2,116,159.47. The Applicant claims these are \"almost entirely unexplainable.\" The context omitted from the founding affidavit is that these expenses supported 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. The IT expenses represent 19.3% of revenue (2024) and 6.1% of revenue (2025)\u2014reasonable for a global e-commerce operation. The Applicant fails to disclose the revenue context.\n#### AD 8.10 - International Expenses and Tax Implications\n7.4 The Applicant claims expenses are \"seemingly international\" and accounts have \"almost exceeded the yearly allowable quota for funds leaving South Africa.\" The Shopify platforms were funded by UK company RegimA Zone Ltd (company 10697009). UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The international expenses were legitimate costs of UK-owned e-commerce operations.\n#### AD 9.2 - Bank Message Regarding International Transfers\n7.5 The Applicant references bank messages about international transfers. The actual international payment flow is demonstrated by Shopify invoices: UK entities (RegimA Zone Ltd) funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The payment direction is UK \u2192 SA, not SA \u2192 UK as the Applicant's affidavit implies.\n#### AD 9.3 - Financial Misconduct Summary\n7.6 The Applicant summarizes alleged misconduct. The documented financial misconduct includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) without the Second Respondent's authority; (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments (Annexure **SF3**, **SF5**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments for this stock (SARS audit email, Annexure **SF4**); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023, unpaid despite Ms. Farrar's false claim to me that it was paid (Annexure **JF2**, **SF6**).\n---\n### 8. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1-10.14: APPLICATION TO DECLARE RESPONDENTS DELINQUENT\n#### AD 10.1 - Relief Sought - Delinquency or Probation\n8.1 The Applicant seeks delinquency or probation orders under Section 162. The evidence establishes grounds for the Applicant's own delinquency: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers in breach of fiduciary duty as co-director; (2) Card cancellation sabotage one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation; (3) False statements about UK payment flows; (4) Abuse of ex parte process through material non-disclosures.\n#### AD 10.3 - Delinquent Conduct of Respondents\n8.2 The Applicant alleges delinquent conduct by the Second Respondent and me. My actual conduct included: (1) Fulfilling fiduciary duty as trustee by investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025); (2) Confronting Ms. Farrar about profiting from proceeds of murder; (3) Being deceived by co-trustees into signing \"Main Trustee\" document (11 Aug 2025, Annexure **JF5**); (4) Being punished with interdict two days later (13 Aug 2025, Annexure **JF6**).\n#### AD 10.4 - Contravention of Companies Act\n8.3 The Applicant alleges Companies Act contraventions. Section 76(3)(b) requires directors to act in good faith and for a proper purpose. The Applicant's actions demonstrate bad faith: (1) Manufactured crisis (card cancellation day after cooperation); (2) Material non-disclosures in ex parte application; (3) False statements about UK operations; (4) Systematic sabotage of profitable businesses.\n#### AD 10.5.2 - Probation Relief Under Section 162\n8.4 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence reveals: Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) commissioned this affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths. Mr. Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery of the fraud the Second Respondent reported.\n#### AD 10.6 - Close Corporations Act - Fiduciary Duties\n8.5 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act fiduciary duties. The Act requires members to manage in the corporation's interest. RegimA Skin Treatments (CC) owes R1,035,000 to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023. Strategic Logistics (CC) lost R5.4M in stock that \"disappeared\"\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory. These transactions were not in the corporations' interests.\n#### AD 10.6.1 - Member's Duty to Manage in Corporation's Interest\n8.6 The Applicant cites duty to manage in corporation's interest. The R5.4M stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics represents 46% of annual sales\u201410 times the historical adjustment. Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments. This transaction was not in Strategic Logistics' interest.\n#### AD 10.6.2 - Member's Duty Not to Exceed Powers\n8.7 The Applicant cites duty not to exceed powers. The unauthorized R900,000 transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) were made without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director. The Applicant exceeded his powers by acting unilaterally.\n#### AD 10.6.3 - Member's Duty to Avoid Conflicts of Interest\n8.8 The Applicant cites duty to avoid conflicts. The evidence reveals multiple conflicts: (1) Mr. Bantjies: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant; (2) Ms. Farrar's son (Adderory) supplying stock to RegimA Skin Treatments while same stock type \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) Villa Via (trust-owned) charging 86% profit margin rent to group; (4) Regimaskin.co.za (owned by Ms. Farrar's son) competing with RegimA operations.\n#### AD 10.7 - Member Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n8.9 The Applicant invokes breach of fiduciary duty liability. The breaches are established: (1) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to the Second Respondent (co-director) by unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries (as trustee) by attacking them with interdict; (3) Mr. Bantjies breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries by dismissing audit request and facilitating fraud.\n#### AD 10.7.1.2 - Liability for Economic Benefit Derived\n8.10 The Applicant cites liability for economic benefit. The economic benefits derived include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (4) 86% profit margin on Villa Via rent; (5) Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za (Adderory).\n#### AD 10.7.1.4 - Liability for Loss Suffered by Corporation\n8.11 The Applicant cites liability for corporate loss. The losses suffered include: (1) RegimA SA: R900K unauthorized transfers, revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025, Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025; (2) RegimA Zone: Customer diversion to competing domain, card cancellation sabotage; (3) Strategic Logistics: R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (4) RegimA Worldwide: Forced to pay 2 years of unallocated expenses from all companies.\n#### AD 10.8 - Disqualification for Misconduct Under Section 47\n8.12 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act Section 47 disqualification. This section applies when a member is guilty of gross negligence or fraud. The R5.4M stock adjustment (46% of sales, 10x historical) in Strategic Logistics, with Ms. Farrar claiming Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments, and the same stock type supplied by Adderory, suggests systematic fraud.\n#### AD 10.8.1 - Declaration of Delinquency as Alternative Relief\n8.13 The Applicant seeks delinquency declaration. The evidence supports declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5): (1) Intentional harm to companies (systematic sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent conduct (card cancellation without notice); (3) Breach of trust (attacking beneficiaries as trustee); (4) Abuse of process (ex parte order based on material non-disclosures and false statements).\n#### AD 10.9 - Mandatory Disqualification Under Section 162(5)\n8.14 The Applicant invokes Section 162(5) mandatory disqualification grounds. These grounds apply to the Applicant's conduct: (1) Intentional harm to companies (R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent harm (card cancellation rendering documentation inaccessible); (3) Breach of trust (trustee attacking beneficiaries).\n#### AD 10.9.2 - Intentional or Grossly Negligent Harm\n8.15 The Applicant alleges intentional or grossly negligent harm by respondents. The intentional harm was inflicted by the Applicant and his co-conspirators: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent cooperates; (2) 7 June: Cards cancelled; (3) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days after my inquiry); (4) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days after my inquiry); (5) 8 July: Warehouse sabotaged; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action followed either my debt inquiry or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure.\n#### AD 10.9.3 - Manner of Acting - Gross Negligence or Misconduct\n8.16 The Applicant alleges gross negligence or misconduct. The gross negligence is demonstrated by: Cancelling 15 business cards without notice, rendering documentation inaccessible, then complaining about missing documentation. This demonstrates consciousness of guilt and bad faith.\n#### AD 10.9.3.1 - Gross Negligence or Wilful Misconduct\n8.17 The Applicant alleges wilful misconduct. The wilful misconduct includes: (1) Systematic revenue diversion (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (2) Data destruction (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Card sabotage (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). This six-month campaign occurred after I investigated fraud and the Second Respondent exposed fraud.\n#### AD 10.9.3.2 - Acquiescence to Fraudulent Acts\n8.18 The Applicant alleges acquiescence to fraud. The acquiescence to fraud includes: (1) Two years of unallocated expenses while Ms. Farrar controlled systems using the Applicant's email and Linda was employed as bookkeeper; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" with Mr. Bantjies allegedly instructing payments; (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate unpaid since Feb 2023; (4) Villa Via 86% profit margin rent extraction.\n#### AD 10.9.3.3 - Party to Omission with Fraudulent Purpose\n8.19 The Applicant alleges omission with fraudulent purpose. The omissions with fraudulent purpose include: (1) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's trustee status from affidavit; (2) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Applicant omitted R34.9M revenue context for IT expenses; (4) Applicant omitted UK \u2192 SA payment flow (claimed opposite); (5) Applicant omitted timeline showing card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation; (6) Applicant omitted my debt inquiry and subsequent retaliation.\n#### AD 10.10 - Probation Under Section 162(7)\n8.20 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162(7). This section applies when conduct is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) I fulfilled fiduciary duty by investigating debt, then was punished with interdict; (2) Second Respondent exposed fraud to accountant, then suffered six-month sabotage campaign; (3) Both excluded from profitable businesses we built.\n#### AD 10.10.2.3 - Oppressive or Prejudicial Exercise of Powers\n8.21 The Applicant alleges oppressive exercise of powers. The oppressive exercise of powers includes: (1) Applicant used trustee powers to attack beneficiaries; (2) Mr. Bantjies used trustee powers to dismiss audit request and facilitate fraud; (3) Applicant used director powers to make unauthorized R900K transfers; (4) Applicant used court process to obtain ex parte order based on material non-disclosures.\n#### AD 10.10.2.4 - Conduct with Oppressive or Prejudicial Result\n8.22 The Applicant alleges conduct with prejudicial result. The prejudicial results include: (1) I was excluded from companies after investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent excluded from R34.9M operations he built; (3) Customers diverted to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son; (4) R900K transferred without authorization; (5) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (6) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate unpaid.\n#### AD 10.10.22 - Business Conducted in Oppressive Manner\n8.23 The Applicant alleges oppressive business conduct. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled all systems using Applicant's email while claiming to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions; (2) Applicant had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems; (3) Two years of expenses unallocated despite employed bookkeeper; (4) Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) dismissed fraud investigation.\n#### AD 10.10.41 - Conduct Inconsistent with Duties\n8.24 The Applicant alleges conduct inconsistent with duties. The conduct inconsistent with duties includes: (1) Trustee attacking beneficiaries (Applicant, Mr. Bantjies); (2) Director making unauthorized transfers (Applicant); (3) Trustee dismissing fraud investigation (Mr. Bantjies); (4) Accountant facilitating fraud while being debtor (Mr. Bantjies); (5) Administrator controlling systems while diverting revenue (Ms. Farrar).\n#### AD 10.13 - Unaccounted Money - Significant Sums\n8.25 The Applicant alleges unaccounted money. The unaccounted money includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023; (4) R1.73 million transferred 11 Sep 2025; (5) Two years of unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide on 30 Mar 2025.\n#### AD 10.14 - Full Extent of Transgressions Not Yet Determined\n8.26 The Applicant claims full extent not yet determined. The full extent includes: (1) Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email; (4) Ms. Farrar's son's competing domain; (5) Adderory's stock supply relationship; (6) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme; (7) Court order seizing Kayla's email during law enforcement investigation.\n---\n### 9. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 11.2-12.4: UK OPERATIONS AND ALLEGED FRAUD\n#### AD 11.2 - UK Head Office - RegimA UK Ltd\n9.1 The Applicant describes UK operations. RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The UK company is the economic owner of the e-commerce operations.\n#### AD 11.3 - Directors of UK Entity\n9.2 The Applicant describes UK directors. The UK company was established by the Second Respondent and Kayla to own and operate the global e-commerce platforms. After Kayla's murder (13 July 2023), the Second Respondent continued managing the operations.\n#### AD 11.4 - Applicant's Role in Operations\n9.3 The Applicant describes his role. The evidence demonstrates the Applicant had no operational role: (1) No access to email (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (4) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's. The Applicant appears to be a figurehead.\n#### AD 11.6 - UK Branch Operations\n9.4 The Applicant describes UK branch operations. The UK company funded SA operations through Shopify subscription payments. Shopify invoices demonstrate UK \u2192 SA payment flow of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The UK company invested in SA operations, not the reverse.\n#### AD 11.8 - UK Financial Concerns\n9.5 The Applicant expresses UK financial concerns. The financial concerns were manufactured: (1) Card cancellation 7 June 2025 disrupted UK funding; (2) Domain theft 29 May 2025 diverted customers; (3) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 destroyed UK-funded operations; (4) Data expungement 22 May 2025 eliminated audit trail.\n#### AD 12.1 - UK Branch Non-Payment and Fraud Concerns\n9.6 The Applicant alleges UK branch non-payment and fraud. The Shopify invoices prove the opposite: UK entities funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). UK bank transactions corroborate the invoices (Annexure **DF8**). The Applicant's statement is demonstrably false.\n#### AD 12.2 - Misappropriation Leading to Insolvency Risk\n9.7 The Applicant alleges misappropriation leading to insolvency. The actual insolvency risk was created by: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (3) Data expungement (22 May); (4) Card cancellation (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). Despite six months of sabotage, the Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied.\n#### AD 12.3 - Purpose of Court Application\n9.8 The Applicant states the purpose is to prevent further harm. The actual purpose appears to be: (1) Punish me for investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May); (2) Punish Second Respondent for exposing Villa Via fraud (6 June); (3) Seize control of R34.9M operations Second Respondent built; (4) Prevent forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and the systematic fraud.\n#### AD 12.4 - Alternative Roles for Wife and Son\n9.9 The Applicant suggests alternative roles for the Second Respondent and me. The evidence demonstrates: (1) I fulfilled trustee duties by investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent built and managed R34.9M profitable operations; (3) Both were systematically sabotaged after investigating/exposing fraud; (4) Both were attacked with interdict by co-trustees; (5) I was included in interdict two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document.\n---\n### 10. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 13.2-13.8: REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERDICTORY RELIEF\n#### AD 13.2 - Clear Right Not to Be Prejudiced\n10.1 The Applicant claims clear right not to be prejudiced. The Applicant has no clear right: (1) He manufactured the crisis (card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (2) He made unauthorized R900K transfers; (3) He had alternative remedies as trustee with \"additional powers\"; (4) He obtained order through material non-disclosures (Mr. Bantjies's trustee status, debtor status, timeline manipulation, UK payment flow misrepresentation).\n#### AD 13.2.2 - Injury Sustained and Apprehension of Further Harm\n10.2 The Applicant claims injury and apprehension of harm. The Applicant suffered no injury he didn't inflict on himself: (1) Card cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible; (2) Unauthorized transfers depleted accounts; (3) Revenue diversions reduced cash flow; (4) Warehouse sabotage destroyed operations. The apprehension of further harm was manufactured to justify ex parte relief.\n#### AD 13.3 - Reasonable Apprehension of Irreparable Harm\n10.3 The Applicant claims reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm. The irreparable harm was inflicted by the Applicant's six-month sabotage campaign: (1) R34.9M operations destroyed (93.3% revenue collapse); (2) Customer relationships diverted to competing domain; (3) Audit data expunged (100% loss); (4) Documentation rendered inaccessible; (5) Accounts emptied. The Second Respondent and I suffered irreparable harm, not the Applicant.\n#### AD 13.4 - Interdicts Essential for Corporation Survival\n10.4 The Applicant claims interdicts essential for survival. The corporations were profitable under the Second Respondent's management (R34.9M annually). The survival threat came from the Applicant's sabotage: (1) Unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data destruction; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Excluding the Second Respondent and me threatened survival, not ensured it.\n#### AD 13.5 - Balance of Convenience Favours Granting Relief\n10.5 The Applicant claims balance of convenience favors relief. The balance overwhelmingly favors the Second Respondent and me: (1) We built and managed profitable operations; (2) We investigated and exposed fraud; (3) We were systematically sabotaged for doing so; (4) We substituted personal cards to prevent business collapse; (5) We support independent forensic audit. The Applicant obtained relief through material non-disclosures and false statements.\n#### AD 13.8 - Other Relief Sought in Part A\n10.6 The Applicant seeks additional relief. The relief was obtained ex parte based on: (1) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Omitting timeline showing card cancellation day after cooperation; (4) Falsely claiming UK owes SA (opposite is true); (5) Omitting R34.9M revenue context; (6) Omitting my debt inquiry and retaliation pattern.\n---\n### 11. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1-14.5: FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND FORENSIC AUDIT\n#### AD 14.1 - Financial Constraints on Respondents\n11.1 The Applicant seeks financial constraints on the Second Respondent and me. The financial constraints were already imposed through sabotage: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Despite six months of sabotage, the Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors.\n#### AD 14.3 - Constraint to Prevent Financial Prejudice\n11.2 The Applicant seeks constraints to prevent prejudice. The prejudice was inflicted by the Applicant: (1) RegimA SA account opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 (Feb-Mar 2025); (2) 169 customer deposits R566,598.57 proving active trade; (3) R1.73M transferred 11 Sep 2025; (4) R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage.\n#### AD 14.4 - Forensic Audit Necessity and Remuneration\n11.3 The Applicant seeks forensic audit. The Second Respondent and I support independent forensic audit by an impartial party. Such audit would reveal: (1) Mr. Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant); (2) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme (Strategic Logistics \u2192 Adderory \u2192 RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (4) Two years unallocated expenses; (5) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (6) Revenue diversion scheme; (7) Ms. Farrar's control of systems using Applicant's email.\n#### AD 14.5 - Request for Relief Under Part B\n11.4 The Applicant requests Part B relief. The relief should include: (1) Setting aside ex parte order obtained through material non-disclosures; (2) Independent forensic audit; (3) Investigation of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts; (4) Investigation of R5.4M stock \"disappearance\"; (5) Recovery of R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (6) Investigation of Ms. Farrar's control and Adderory's role; (7) Consideration of Applicant's delinquency under Section 162(5).\n---\n### 12. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1-16.12: DISCOVERY AND URGENCY\n#### AD 16.1 - Discovery of Respondents' Conduct\n12.1 The Applicant claims discovery of conduct in mid-June 2025. The actual discovery timeline: (1) 15 May: I discovered R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (2) 6 June: Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies; (3) 7 June: Applicant cancelled cards (day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (4) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed audit request. The Applicant's \"discovery\" was actually consciousness of guilt after the Second Respondent exposed fraud to Mr. Bantjies.\n#### AD 16.2 - R600,000 Transfer as Trigger for Action\n12.2 The Applicant cites R600,000 transfer (later corrected to R500,000) as trigger. The actual triggers were: (1) 15 May: I confronted Ms. Farrar about R1,035,000 debt and \"profiting from proceeds of murder\"; (2) 6 June: Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed audit request. The R500,000 transfer is a pretext.\n#### AD 16.5 - Unawareness of Urgent Application Process\n12.3 The Applicant claims unawareness of urgent process. The Applicant had access to legal advice and Mr. Bantjies as Commissioner of Oaths. The delay from mid-June to August contradicts urgency. The actual urgency appears to be preventing forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and systematic fraud.\n#### AD 16.6 - Delay Would Have Been Avoided\n12.4 The Applicant claims delay would have been avoided if he knew the process. The two-month delay (mid-June to August) contradicts urgency. The timing suggests: (1) Waiting to see if Second Respondent's audit request would proceed; (2) Coordinating with Mr. Bantjies (who dismissed audit request 10 June); (3) Preparing my punishment (included in interdict 13 Aug, two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document 11 Aug).\n#### AD 16.8 - State of Shock and Delayed Response\n12.5 The Applicant claims state of shock. The Applicant was not in shock\u2014he was executing a systematic sabotage campaign: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping; (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 7 Jun: Card cancellation; (6) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (7) 11 Sep: Account emptying. This is not shock\u2014this is systematic execution.\n#### AD 16.10 - Attorney Consultation Timeline\n12.6 The Applicant describes attorney consultation. The consultation occurred after: (1) My debt inquiry (15 May); (2) Data expungement (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June); (5) Card cancellation (7 June); (6) Mr. Bantjies's audit dismissal (10 June). The legal action was retaliation, not discovery.\n#### AD 16.12 - Need for Urgent Court Assistance\n12.7 The Applicant claims need for urgent assistance. The Applicant had alternative remedies: (1) Trustee with \"additional powers\" as Founder; (2) Could have conducted audit as trustee; (3) Could have consulted with co-trustee (me) instead of attacking me; (4) Could have consulted with co-trustee Mr. Bantjies (who was facilitating the fraud). The Applicant chose ex parte process to avoid disclosure of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and systematic sabotage.\n---\n### 13. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 17.3-17.4: EX PARTE BASIS\n#### AD 17.3 - Ex Parte Basis for Application\n13.1 The Applicant justifies ex parte application. The ex parte process was abused through material non-disclosures: (1) Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Timeline manipulation (card cancellation day after cooperation); (4) UK payment flow misrepresentation (claimed SA \u2192 UK, actually UK \u2192 SA); (5) R34.9M revenue context omission; (6) My debt inquiry and retaliation pattern; (7) Second Respondent's fraud exposure and retaliation pattern; (8) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email; (9) Adderory's competing domain; (10) R5.4M stock \"disappearance.\"\n#### AD 17.4 - Urgency Justifies Ex Parte Relief\n13.2 The Applicant claims urgency justifies ex parte relief. The urgency was manufactured: (1) Two-month delay contradicts urgency; (2) Card cancellation day after cooperation shows consciousness of guilt; (3) Systematic sabotage from Feb-Sep shows premeditation; (4) I was included two days after signing document, showing coordination; (5) Alternative remedies available as trustee. The ex parte relief was obtained to prevent the Second Respondent and me from exposing the material non-disclosures and systematic fraud.\n---\n### 14. RESPONSE TO REMAINING AD PARAGRAPHS (18.3, 20, 22, 40.9.4, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, 88)\n#### AD 18.3 - Continual Unauthorized Fund Transfers\n14.1 The Applicant alleges continual unauthorized transfers. The unauthorized transfers were made by the Applicant: R450,000 on 14 Feb 2025 + R450,000 on 15 Feb 2025 = R900,000 total from RegimA SA without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director. RegimA SA account: opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 within one month despite 169 customer deposits R566,598.57.\n#### AD 20 - First and Second Respondent Details\n14.2 The Applicant provides the Second Respondent's and my details. The details omitted include: (1) I confronted Ms. Farrar about R1,035,000 debt on 15 May 2025; (2) I was deceived into signing \"Main Trustee\" document on 11 Aug 2025; (3) I was included in interdict on 13 Aug 2025 (two days later); (4) Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud on 6 June 2025; (5) Second Respondent suffered six-month sabotage campaign; (6) Second Respondent built R34.9M profitable operations with murdered partner Kayla.\n#### AD 22 - Additional Party Information\n14.3 The Applicant provides additional information. The information omitted includes: (1) Faucitt Family Trust has three trustees: Applicant, me, Mr. Bantjies; (2) Mr. Bantjies's trustee status was unknown to beneficiaries; (3) Mr. Bantjies is debtor owing R18.685M; (4) Mr. Bantjies is accountant controlling financial systems; (5) Mr. Bantjies dismissed Second Respondent's audit request; (6) Mr. Bantjies commissioned this affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths.\n#### AD 40.9.4 - Gross Abuse of Director/Member Position\n14.4 The Applicant alleges gross abuse of position. The gross abuse includes: (1) Applicant made R900K unauthorized transfers as director; (2) Applicant cancelled cards without notice as director; (3) Applicant used trustee position to attack beneficiaries; (4) Mr. Bantjies used trustee position to dismiss audit and facilitate fraud; (5) Ms. Farrar used administrative position to control systems, divert revenue, and facilitate son's competing domain.\n#### AD 44 - Applicant Identity Details\n14.5 The Applicant confirms identity. The Applicant's actual position: (1) No access to email (pete@regima.com controlled by Ms. Farrar); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (4) Debtor to Mr. Bantjies (R18.685M due May 2026); (5) Figurehead while Ms. Farrar claims to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions.\n#### AD 50 - Registered Address Details\n14.6 The Applicant provides address: 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview. This is also my address. The Applicant attacked me (co-trustee, beneficiary) with interdict two days after I signed \"Main Trustee\" document, punishing me for investigating R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate and supporting the Second Respondent.\n#### AD 74 - Timeline Context\n14.7 The Applicant provides timeline context. The actual timeline: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping (12-hour deadline); (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 15 May: My debt inquiry; (6) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days later); (7) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days later); (8) 6 Jun: Second Respondent's fraud exposure; (9) 7 Jun: Cards cancelled (1 day later); (10) 10 Jun: Audit dismissed; (11) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotaged; (12) 11 Aug: I sign document; (13) 13 Aug: I included in interdict (2 days later); (14) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied.\n#### AD 78 - Accountant's Office Visit and Discovery\n14.8 The Applicant describes Mr. Bantjies's office visit. The visit occurred after: (1) Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025; (2) Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) Applicant cancelled cards on 7 June 2025 (day after Second Respondent's cooperation). Mr. Bantjies \"discovered\" irregularities after the Second Respondent reported fraud to him. Mr. Bantjies then dismissed audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\"\n#### AD 83 - Irregular Payments Discovery\n14.9 The Applicant describes discovery of irregular payments. The irregular payments include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers by Applicant (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics (same type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments (SARS audit email); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023 (Ms. Farrar falsely claimed paid to me on 15 May 2025).\n#### AD 88 - Follow-up Actions\n14.10 The Applicant describes follow-up actions. The follow-up actions include: (1) 7 Jun: Card cancellation (day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (2) 10 Jun: Mr. Bantjies dismisses audit; (3) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (4) 11 Aug: I was deceived into signing document; (5) 13 Aug: I was included in interdict; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action was retaliation against me (15 May debt inquiry) and the Second Respondent (6 Jun fraud exposure).\n---\n### 15. PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n15.1 I respectfully request that this Honourable Court:\n15.1.1 Set aside the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025 on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n15.1.2 Dismiss the Applicant's application for delinquency or probation orders against the Second Respondent and me.\n15.1.3 Grant a counter-application declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008, on the grounds of:\n- Intentional harm to companies through systematic sabotage;\n- Grossly negligent conduct in card cancellation without notice;\n- Breach of fiduciary duty to beneficiaries as trustee;\n- Abuse of court process through material non-disclosures and false statements.\n15.1.4 Order an independent forensic audit by an impartial auditor to investigate:\n- Mr. Bantjies's conflicts of interest (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant);\n- R5.4 million stock transfer pricing scheme;\n- R1,035,000 debt to Kayla Pretorius's estate;\n- Two years of unallocated expenses;\n- Unauthorized R900,000 transfers;\n- Revenue diversion scheme;\n- Ms. Farrar's control of systems and Adderory's role.\n15.1.5 Order the Applicant to pay the costs of this application on the scale as between attorney and client.\n15.1.6 Grant such further and/or alternative relief as this Honourable Court deems fit.\n---\n### 16. CONCLUSION\n16.1 The evidence presented in this affidavit demonstrates that I fulfilled my fiduciary duties as a trustee by investigating a substantial debt owed to a deceased beneficiary's estate. I confronted Ms. Farrar about this debt on 15 May 2025, stating that keeping the funds would constitute profiting from the proceeds of murder.\n16.2 Within seven days of my inquiry, Shopify data was expunged, eliminating the audit trail. Within 14 days, a competing domain was registered by Ms. Farrar's son's company, diverting customers from the Second Respondent's operations.\n16.3 On 11 August 2025, I was deceived by my co-trustees into signing a \"Main Trustee\" document that backdated the Applicant's designation to 1 July 2025. Two days later, on 13 August 2025, the Applicant and Mr. Bantjies included me in this interdict.\n16.4 The ex parte order was obtained through material non-disclosures, including Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status, his R18.685 million debt to the trust, the timeline showing card cancellation one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation, false statements about UK payment flows, and the omission of the R34.9 million revenue context.\n16.5 The Second Respondent and I support an independent forensic audit by an impartial party. Such an audit would reveal the systematic fraud, conflicts of interest, and abuse of process that underlie this application.\n16.6 I respectfully submit that the balance of convenience overwhelmingly favors setting aside the ex parte order and granting the relief sought in this affidavit.\n---\n**SIGNED at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025.**\n---\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**  \nFirst Respondent\n---\n**THUS SIGNED AND SWORN TO before me at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025, the Deponent having acknowledged that she knows and understands the contents of this Affidavit, that she has no objection to taking the prescribed oath, and that she considers the oath to be binding on her conscience.**\n---\n**COMMISSIONER OF OATHS**\n---\n## LIST OF ANNEXURES\n**JF1:** Trust deed and trustee documentation  \n**JF2:** Email correspondence re R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025)  \n**JF3:** Rynette's false statement documentation  \n**JF4:** Domain registration records (regimaskin.co.za, 29 May 2025)  \n**JF5:** \"Main Trustee\" document (signed 11 Aug 2025, backdated to 1 July 2025)  \n**JF6:** Interdict order (13 Aug 2025)  \n**JF7:** Personal card statements (substitution to prevent collapse)  \n**JF8:** Email from Gee re domain diversion (20 June 2025)\n**DF1:** Shopify operations overview (51+ stores, R34.9M revenue)  \n**DF2:** Villa Via fraud analysis (86% profit margin)  \n**DF3:** Email correspondence with Bantjies (6 June 2025)  \n**DF4:** Card cancellation records (7 June 2025)  \n**DF5-DF7:** Shopify invoices (UK \u2192 SA payment flow, R84,661+ annually)  \n**DF8:** UK bank transactions (corroborating Shopify payments)  \n**DF9:** Unauthorized transfer records (R450K + R450K = R900K, 14-15 Feb 2025)  \n**DF10:** RegimA SA account statements (opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08)  \n**DF11:** Customer deposit records (169 deposits, R566,598.57)  \n**DF12:** Revenue diversion documentation (1 Mar, 14 Apr, 11 Sep 2025)  \n**DF13:** Warehouse sabotage instruction (8 July 2025)  \n**DF14:** Expense dumping documentation (30 Mar 2025)\n**SF1:** Bantjies debt documentation (R18.685M, investment payout schedule)  \n**SF2:** Sage screenshots (Rynette using pete@regima.com, June & Aug 2025)  \n**SF3:** Strategic Logistics R5.4M stock adjustment documentation  \n**SF4:** SARS audit email (Rynette claiming Bantjies instructed payments)  \n**SF5:** Adderory company registration and stock supply documentation  \n**SF6:** Kayla Pretorius estate documentation (R1,035,000 debt)  \n**SF7:** Court order seizing Kayla's email account  \n**SF8:** Linda employment records (bookkeeper)\n---\n**END OF AFFIDAVIT**",

 as he claims in his founding affidavit.\n2.1.5\nEvery instance where the Applicant claims direct knowledge through email receipt constitutes perjury, as he could not have received these communications directly.\n2.2 Information Manipulation and Misrepresentation\n2.2.1\nThe evidence demonstrates that the Applicant has been subjected to systematic information manipulation through intermediaries who control his communications.\n2.2.2\nThe Applicant's knowledge is based entirely on filtered and potentially manipulated information provided by Rynette Farrar and other intermediaries, not on direct observation or communication.\n2.2.3\nThe screenshot dated 25 August 2025 further confirms this control structure, stating: \"To activate your account, please contact Rynette Farrar who is the subscription owner for this registration.\"\n2.3 Confirmatory Affidavit Contamination\n2.3.1\nThe Applicant relies heavily on the confirmatory affidavit of one Daniel Jacobus Bantjies (marked \"PF5\" in the founding papers).\n2.3.2\nEvidence demonstrates that Mr. Bantjies had knowledge of criminal matters, including allegations of murder and fraud, by 10 June 2025.\n2.3.3\nDespite this knowledge, Mr. Bantjies proceeded to provide a confirmatory affidavit supporting allegations he knew to be incomplete and misleading, constituting perjury.\n2.4 Legal Effect of Perjury\n2.4.1\nIt is trite law that perjury in founding affidavits renders the entire application and any order granted thereon void ab initio.\n2.4.2\nThe interdict obtained on 19 August 2025 is therefore void and of no force or effect.\n2.4.3\nThe applicant is attempting to accelerate the proceedings, filing additional interdicts and false claims before the Respondents have an opportunity to prepare the necessary evidence to file a comprehensive response.\n________________________________\n3. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED UNEXPLAINED IT EXPENSES\n3.1\nThe Applicant alleges at paragraphs 7.4 to 7.8 of his founding affidavit that there were \"numerous irregular payments\" and \"unexplained\" IT expenses totalling R6,738,007.47 for 2024 and R2,116,159.47 for 2025.\n3.2\nThese allegations are comprehensively refuted by the following documentary evidence:\n3.2.1 Legitimate Business Expenses\nAll IT expenses were legitimate business expenses necessary for the operation of an international distribution company with:\n*\tMultiple e-commerce platforms requiring substantial infrastructure\n*\tInternational payment processing systems\n*\tCloud storage and backup systems\n*\tCybersecurity measures appropriate for handling sensitive customer data\n*\tSoftware licenses for business operations\n3.2.2 Documentary Evidence\nInvoices and supporting documentation for these expenses exist and include:\n*\tShopify Plus subscription services for RegimA SA and RegimA WW+Zone stores\n*\tWeb Services, hosting and infrastructure\n*\tMicrosoft 365 Business licenses for all staff\n*\tAdobe Creative Cloud for marketing materials\n*\tSage accounting software (which the Applicant admits is legitimate at paragraph 8.2)\n*\tDomain registrations and SSL certificates\n*\tPayment gateway fees (Stripe, PayPal, Peach Payments)\n3.2.3 International Nature of Business\nThe Applicant's allegation at paragraph 8.7 that expenses were \"seemingly international\" ignores the documented fact that:\n*\tRegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd operates internationally\n*\tThe company has international regulatory obligations\n*\tInternational payment processing and infrastructure are essential business requirements\n*\tThe Reserve Bank allocations referenced confirm legitimate international business operations\n3.3\nThe Applicant's claim at paragraph 8.4 that \"we have almost no invoices for these items\" is false. All invoices were available but the Applicant:\n*\tCancelled access cards preventing proper record retrieval (paragraph 7.5)\n*\tObtained a court order\n*\tRefused to engage with explanations provided\n*\tRelied on intermediaries who filtered information\n*\tMany of the accounts are held by Kayla Pretorius who was murdered in 2023 and we were instructed to hand logins to investigators and touch nothing until law enforcement has completed the investigation\n________________________________\n4. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED UNAUTHORIZED BIRTHDAY GIFT\n4.1\nThe Applicant alleges at paragraph 7.18 that the First Respondent transferred R500,000.00 to the Second Respondent as an unauthorized \"birthday gift.\"\n4.2\nThis allegation is refuted as follows:\n4.2.1 Authorized Director Remuneration\nThe payment was not a \"gift\" but constituted authorized director's loan:\n*\tSecond Respondent made the First Respondent aware of the situation\n*\tRecorded in company bank accounts to ensure audit trail compliance\n*\tNecessary to prevent defaulting creditor payments leading to insolvent status\n*\tConsistent with the sudden escalation of personal payments to creditors\n4.2.2 First Respondent's Authority\nAs a co-director and member of the close corporation, the First Respondent had full authority to approve necessary loans in accordance with:\n*\tThe Close Corporations Act provisions\n*\tThe corporations' founding statements\n*\tEstablished company practice over decades\n4.2.3 Pattern of Selective Memory\nThe Applicant's characterization of legitimate director loan as a \"gift\" demonstrates either:\n*\tDeliberate misrepresentation to the Court, or\n*\tCognitive impairment affecting his ability to recall business decisions\n________________________________\n5. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED INTERFERENCE WITH STAFF\n5.1\nThe Applicant alleges at paragraphs 7.9 to 7.14 that the Respondents interfered with corporate staff and withheld email access.\n5.2\nThese allegations are comprehensively refuted:\n5.2.1 Protection of Business Continuity\nFollowing the Applicant's erratic behaviour in cancelling payment cards (paragraph 7.5), which caused:\n*\tDomain names to lapse\n*\tEssential services to be terminated\n*\tBusiness email systems to fail\n*\tCustomer communications to be disrupted\nEmergency measures were required to restore business operations.\n5.2.2 Restoration of Services\nThe Second Respondent worked to:\n*\tRestore domain registrations using personal funds\n*\tReinstate email services for all staff\n*\tMaintain business continuity\n*\tProtect customer relationships\n5.2.3 Staff Communication\nDocumentary evidence shows that:\n*\tAll staff maintained email access except during the period of the Applicant's card cancellations\n*\tStaff communications continued normally once services were restored\n*\tRynette Farrar impersonation of Pete@regima.com <mailto:Pete@regima.com>  email flagged a security hold on Rynette and Linda emails pending investigation\n*\tRegimA Worldwide Distribution itself has No staff members\n5.3\nThe allegation of \"interference\" is projection by the Applicant, who himself interfered with business operations through impulsive card cancellations. The company responsible for payment of worldwide email accounts was sabotaged by the Applicant who then attempted the hold the company liable for disruption caused to staff in a completely different company.\n________________________________\n6. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED WITHHOLDING OF DOCUMENTATION\n6.1\nThe Applicant alleges at paragraphs 7.5 and 8.2 that documentation and invoices were withheld.\n6.2\nThis allegation is false:\n6.2.1 Self-Created Access Problem\nThe Applicant himself created the documentation access problem by:\n*\tCancelling payment cards linked to cloud storage accounts\n*\tCausing accounting software subscriptions to lapse\n*\tTerminating document management systems\n*\tRefusing to maintain essential business services\n6.2.2 Documentation Availability\nAll documentation was and remains available through:\n*\tCloud storage systems (once restored after Applicant's cancellations)\n*\tAccounting software records\n*\tEmail archives\n*\tPhysical files at company premises\n6.2.3 Selective Documentation Request\nThe Applicant's selective request for only IT-related invoices while ignoring other expense categories demonstrates:\n*\tPredetermined narrative construction\n*\tCherry-picking of information\n*\tBad faith in the application\n________________________________\n7. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT\n7.1\nThe Applicant makes sweeping allegations of financial misconduct without providing specific evidence of any actual misappropriation.\n7.2\nThe true position is:\n7.2.1 Profitable Operations\nThe corporations' financial records demonstrate:\n*\tConsistent profitability over multiple years\n*\tGrowing revenue streams (2M->12M->19M)\n*\tSuccessful international expansion\n*\tProper tax compliance (until disrupted by Applicant's actions)\n7.2.2 External Validation\nThe corporations have been audited and reviewed by:\n*\tExternal accountants\n*\tSARS tax compliance\n*\tBanking institutions\n*\tNo findings of misconduct have been made\n7.2.3 Applicant's Financial Mismanagement\nConversely, the Applicant's actions have caused financial harm:\n*\tDisrupting payment systems and forcing companies into insolvency\n*\tCausing service lapses and denying Respondents access to records\n*\tDamaging vendor relationships and POPIA violations\n*\tCreating tax compliance issues through his interference\n________________________________\n8. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTIES\n8.1\nThe Applicant alleges at paragraphs 10.1 to 10.10 various breaches of fiduciary duties citing the Companies Act and Close Corporations Act.\n8.2\nThese allegations are without merit:\n8.2.1 Business Judgment Rule\nAll decisions made by the Respondents were:\n*\tIn good faith\n*\tFor proper purpose\n*\tIn the best interests of the companies\n*\tBased on reasonable business judgment\n8.2.2 Collective Decision Making\nAs equal members/directors, both the Applicant and First Respondent have equal say in corporate matters.

The main issue is that we are denied access by the Applicant so it takes longer to put the necessary supporting evidence together. Peter is attempting to accelerate the whole process to prevent evidence from being seen by the court. Already another interdict has been issued where he already includes a predetermined psychological assessment specified by his own assertions. I have all my personal banking records to refute the claims entirely so we need to submit the evidence proving the claims are false, not follow his speculative delusions down the rabbit hole.\nWarm Regards\nDan\n________________________________\nFrom: Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za>\nSent: Thursday, 02 October 2025 18:42\nTo: jax@regima.zone <jax@regima.zone>; Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nCc: Ian Levitt <ian@ianlevitt.co.za>; Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za>\nSubject: Fw: PETER ANDREW FAUCITT / JACQUELINE FAUCITT & OTHERS // CASE NO: 2025-137857\nDear Jacqui and Daniel,\nPlease see attached. \n\nKind regards,\n\nNATAN BACK\nCANDIDATE ATTORNEY\n\nIAN LEVITT ATTORNEYS\nTHE LEONARDO, OFFICE LEVEL 12,\n75 ON MAUDE STREET\nSANDTON, 2196\nDX 54 SANDTON SQUARE\nTEL:     011 784 3310 \nFAX TO EMAIL :   086 579 5368\nwww.ianlevitt.co.za <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.ianlevitt.co.za_&d=DwMF-g&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=7ZULBZmD5L4dM8U3nU-5WA&m=YNUdyy4XMTA8XYWUgU5btwNh8hqpCFlmEAXLw1ui6_jdWB3t8v8I81MhOQiQYEzI&s=JmaPHxzJWpPtor46PS974OXxiJ5gvosLbdrwuK4E10Y&e=> \nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: \nThis email is intended solely for the recipient(s) to whom this email is addressed.

manufactured crisis\n- Section 76(3)(b) of Companies Act - bad faith and improper purpose\n- Section 162(5) of Companies Act - grounds for Peter's delinquency\n- Section 9(1) of Trust Property Control Act - trustee duties\n- Requirements for interdictory relief (clear right, harm, balance of convenience)\n### Strategic Recommendations\n- Emphasize manufactured crisis argument\n- Highlight retaliation pattern\n- Leverage Shopify invoice evidence for perjury\n- Support independent forensic audit\n- Pursue counter-application for Peter's delinquency\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nSent: Saturday, 01 November 2025 14:30\nTo: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.com>; Daniel Faucitt <d@rzo.io>; regizone <regizone@proton.me>\nSubject: AD NOTES - JACQUELINE FAUCITT \n## ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT: JACQUELINE FAUCITT\n**IN THE HIGH COURT OF SOUTH AFRICA**  \n**GAUTENG DIVISION, PRETORIA**\n**Case No:** 2025-137857\n**In the matter between:**\n**PETER ANDREW FAUCITT** \u2014 Applicant\nand\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT** \u2014 First Respondent  \n**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT** \u2014 Second Respondent  \n*(and others)*\n---\n## I, THE UNDERSIGNED\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**\ndo hereby make oath and state that:\n---\n### 1. INTRODUCTION AND CAPACITY\n1.1 I am the First Respondent in this matter, an adult female, and a South African citizen residing at 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview.\n1.2 I am a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust (IT 3651/2013) and a Beneficiary of the same trust. I am also a co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (2017/087935/07) and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (2011/005722/07), both of which are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust.\n1.3 The facts deposed to in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and belief, save where the context indicates otherwise, and are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\n1.4 Where I make legal submissions, I do so on the advice of my legal representatives.\n---\n### 2. PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT\n2.1 This affidavit is filed in response to the Applicant's founding affidavit and the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025.\n2.2 I oppose the relief sought by the Applicant and seek to have the ex parte order set aside on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n2.3 I address each of the Applicant's allegations in the order they appear in the founding affidavit, following the AD paragraph sequence.\n---\n### 3. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 1-3.13: PARTIES AND STRUCTURE\n#### AD 1 - Director Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n3.1 The Applicant invokes provisions relating to director liability for breach of fiduciary duty. I note that the accounting system used to track the alleged breaches was controlled by Rynette Farrar using the Applicant's email address (pete@regima.com), as evidenced by Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 (Annexure **SF2**). The Applicant himself had no access to this system.\n#### AD 1.3 - Applicant's Personal Details and Declaration\n3.2 The Applicant's personal details are noted. I observe that this affidavit was commissioned by Danie Jacobus Bantjies, identified as \"our accountant.\" The full extent of Mr. Bantjies's roles will become apparent through the evidence presented herein.\n#### AD 2 - Company Business Conduct Requirements\n3.3 The Applicant alleges reckless or grossly negligent business conduct. The financial performance of the companies demonstrates the contrary. The Second Respondent and his late partner, Kayla Pretorius, built 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. RegimA SA operates 25 stores with R8.5 million turnover, while RegimA Zone operates 26 stores with R26.4 million turnover. The businesses were highly profitable under the Second Respondent's management.\n#### AD 2.4 - Parties to the Application - Introduction\n3.4 The Applicant introduces the parties. The corporate structure reveals that certain entities are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust, which has three trustees. Two are identified in the founding affidavit: the Applicant and myself. The third trustee's identity was not disclosed to the beneficiaries until recently.\n#### AD 3 - Court Order for Probation of Directors/Members\n3.5 The Applicant seeks probation orders under Section 162 of the Companies Act. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence will demonstrate that the accountant who allegedly \"discovered\" the irregularities has multiple undisclosed roles that create impermissible conflicts.\n#### AD 3.2 - Respondents - Wife\n3.6 I am correctly identified as the Applicant's wife and First Respondent. On 15 May 2025, I confronted Rynette Farrar regarding a debt of R1,035,000 owed by RegimA Skin Treatments CC to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd since February 2023 (Annexure **JF2**). These funds were part of Kayla Pretorius's estate. I informed Ms. Farrar that keeping these funds would constitute profiting from the proceeds of murder. This confrontation proved significant in the events that followed.\n#### AD 3.4 - Respondents - Son\n3.7 The Second Respondent is correctly identified as the Applicant's son. On 6 June 2025, the Second Respondent cooperated with the Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports to the accountant regarding Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC, which is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust (Annexure **DF3**). The Second Respondent unknowingly reported fraud to one of the perpetrators.\n#### AD 3.4.2 - Third Respondent - RegimA Skin Treatments\n3.8 RegimA Skin Treatments CC (B1992/005371/23) owes R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, part of Kayla Pretorius's estate, since February 2023. When I raised this debt on 15 May 2025, Ms. Farrar claimed it was paid\u2014a statement I have since determined to be false. RegimA Skin Treatments receives stock from Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure **SF5**).\n#### AD 3.6 - Fourth Respondent - Regim A UK\n3.9 RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). This contradicts claims made later in the founding affidavit regarding UK entities owing money to SA operations.\n#### AD 3.6.1 - Fifth Respondent - Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC\n3.10 Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC (1996/004451/23) is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. Financial analysis reveals an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group\u2014an excessive profit extraction (Annexure **DF2**). This was the fraud the Second Respondent reported to the accountant on 6 June 2025.\n#### AD 3.6.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Villa Via Arcadia\n3.11 Property registration confirms trust ownership. The trust has three trustees, but only two were known to the beneficiaries at the time of this application.\n#### AD 3.7 - Sixth Respondent - Strategic Logistics CC\n3.12 Strategic Logistics CC (2008/136496/23) experienced a R5.4 million stock adjustment in 2024\u2014stock that allegedly \"just disappeared\" (Annexure **SF3**). This represents 46% of annual sales (R5.4M on R11.3M sales) and is 10 times the prior year's adjustment. The stock type matches inventory supplied by Adderory (Pty) Ltd to RegimA Skin Treatments.\n#### AD 3.7.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Strategic Logistics\n3.13 Property registration documents are noted. In a SARS audit email concerning the R5.4M stock adjustment, Ms. Farrar claimed that Danie Bantjies instructed her to make the substantial payments related to this transaction (Annexure **SF4**).\n#### AD 3.8 - Seventh Respondent - FirstRand Bank (FNB)\n3.14 FNB holds accounts for the companies. On 14 and 15 February 2025, unauthorized transfers of R450,000 each (R900,000 total) were made from RegimA SA's FNB account without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director (Annexure **DF9**). The account opened with R997,597.94 and closed at R5,284.08 within one month, despite 169 customer deposits totaling R566,598.57 proving active trade (Annexure **DF10**, **DF11**).\n#### AD 3.9 - Eighth and Ninth Respondents\n3.15 ABSA Bank and CIPC are cited. Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution began with an ABSA bank letter dated 14 April 2025 (Annexure **DF12**).\n#### AD 3.11 - Reference to Respondents as Wife and Son\n3.16 The Applicant refers to the Second Respondent and me as \"my wife\" and \"my son.\" Both of us are beneficiaries of the Faucitt Family Trust. I am also a co-trustee. The Trust Property Control Act, 57 of 1988, Section 9(1) requires trustees to act with care, diligence, and skill in the interests of beneficiaries.\n#### AD 3.13 - Court Jurisdiction and Identity Confirmation\n3.17 Jurisdiction is confirmed. The affidavit was commissioned by Danie Bantjies, who signed as \"Commissioner of Oaths.\" Mr. Bantjies's accounting firm is \"Bantjes and Company.\" His full relationship to the trust and companies will be revealed through the evidence presented herein.\n---\n### 4. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTANT DETAILS - BANTJIES CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n#### AD 4 - Accountant Details - Bantjes and Company\n4.1 The Applicant identifies \"our accountant\" as Danie Jacobus Bantjies of \"Bantjes and Company,\" who attended the office in mid-June 2025. What the Applicant does not disclose are the following material facts:\n4.1.1 Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust\u2014a status that was unknown to the beneficiaries, the Second Respondent and myself, until recently.\n4.1.2 Mr. Bantjies is a debtor to the trust, owing R18.685 million on an investment payout schedule with payments due in May 2026, May 2027, and May 2029 (Annexure **SF1**).\n4.1.3 Mr. Bantjies controls the financial systems and gave instructions to Ms. Farrar for multi-million rand transactions, as evidenced by emails (Annexure **SF4**).\n4.1.4 Mr. Bantjies was \"running the companies\" when the Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud on 6 June 2025.\n4.1.5 Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\"\n4.2 This creates an impermissible conflict of interest: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant + Company Controller. Mr. Bantjies had a direct financial interest in preventing discovery of the fraud the Second Respondent reported.\n---\n### 5. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1-6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE\n#### AD 6.1 - Relationships Between Parties\n5.1 The Applicant describes family and corporate relationships. The evidence demonstrates a different control structure. Ms. Farrar controlled all bank accounts (the Applicant had no access), controlled the Sage accounting system using the Applicant's email (pete@regima.com), and claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions rather than the Applicant's (Annexure **SF2**). Ms. Farrar's sister, Linda, was employed as bookkeeper, yet two years of expenses remained unallocated until 30 March 2025 (Annexure **SF8**).\n#### AD 6.3 - Directors and Members of Respondent Entities\n5.2 The Applicant describes directorships. The Second Respondent and I are co-directors of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd. RegimA Worldwide Distribution is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. On 30 March 2025, Ms. Farrar and the Applicant dumped two years of unallocated expenses into RegimA Worldwide Distribution and demanded the Second Respondent sign off within 12 hours for SARS VAT and Annual Accounts (Annexure **DF14**). The Second Respondent used this deadline extension (until 6 June) to finalize reports and uncover the Villa Via fraud.\n#### AD 6.5 - Banking and Registration of Respondent Entities\n5.3 The Applicant describes banking arrangements. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to any bank accounts; (2) Ms. Farrar controlled all accounts; (3) Revenue diversion for RegimA SA started 1 March 2025; (4) Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution started 14 April 2025 (ABSA bank letter); (5) On 11 September 2025, R1.73 million was transferred from accounts (Annexure **DF12**).\n---\n### 6. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7-7.20: URGENCY AND ALLEGED MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 7 - Urgency and Delay Considerations\n6.1 The Applicant claims urgency. The timeline reveals: (1) Alleged discovery mid-June 2025; (2) Application filed August 2025; (3) Two-month delay contradicts urgency. The actual urgency relates to the Second Respondent's fraud exposure on 6 June and my debt inquiry on 15 May.\n#### AD 7.3 - Urgency Details\n6.2 The Applicant claims the accountant noted \"numerous discrepancies\" and \"irregular payments\" in mid-June 2025. Timeline analysis reveals: 6 June 2025 (Second Respondent provides comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies), 7 June 2025 (Applicant cancels 15 UK business cards without notice). The card cancellation occurred one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation, not \"following\" any discovery. This demonstrates that the Applicant created the problem he now complains about.\n#### AD 7.6 - Financial Impact of Misconduct\n6.3 The Applicant alleges financial impact. The actual financial sabotage included: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) Revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025; (3) Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025 (100% audit data loss, seven days after my confrontation with Ms. Farrar); (4) Card cancellation 7 June 2025; (5) Domain theft 29 May 2025 (regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory, 14 days after my confrontation, Annexure **JF4**); (6) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 (R34.9M operations destroyed).\n#### AD 7.8 - Continuing Harm to Corporations\n6.4 The Applicant claims continuing harm. The harm was systematically inflicted. An email from Gee dated 20 June 2025 states she was instructed to send a \"don't use regima.zone only use regimaskin.co.za\" email (Annexure **JF8**). The domain regimaskin.co.za is owned by Adderory (Pty) Ltd (Ms. Farrar's son's company), not by RegimA. This diverted customers from the Second Respondent's platforms to a competing domain controlled by Ms. Farrar's family.\n#### AD 7.10 - Card Cancellations and Service Interruptions\n6.5 The Applicant claims he cancelled cards in June 2025 \"following\" the accountant's discovery and requested invoices from the Second Respondent. Timeline evidence demonstrates: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent provides comprehensive reports; (2) 7 June: Applicant cancels UK cards (5191, 5225) paying for Shopify subscriptions (Annexure **DF4**); (3) Cards cancelled one day after cooperation, not after any discovery. The cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible (card-based authentication), then the Applicant complained about missing documentation.\n#### AD 7.13 - Domain and Service Halts Due to Card Cancellations\n6.6 The Applicant claims subscriptions were halted due to card cancellations. To prevent business collapse, the Second Respondent substituted his personal card (1927) for RegimA SA and I substituted my personal card (3212) for RegimA Zone (Annexure **JF7**). Meanwhile, the competing domain regimaskin.co.za was actively diverting customers.\n#### AD 7.16 - Son's Interference with Business Operations\n6.7 The Applicant alleges the Second Respondent interfered with operations. The evidence demonstrates the Second Respondent built and managed 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually (Annexure **DF1**). The Second Respondent's partner, Kayla Pretorius, co-built these operations before her murder on 13 July 2023. After Kayla's death, a court order was obtained to seize her email account (kayp@rzo.io), which interfered with a law enforcement investigation that had instructed a freeze on the account (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.18 - Email and Account Access Interference\n6.8 The Applicant claims the Second Respondent restricted email access. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to his own email (pete@regima.com)\u2014controlled by Ms. Farrar; (2) Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 show Ms. Farrar using the Applicant's email (Annexure **SF2**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's; (4) Kayla's email was seized by court order after her murder (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.20 - Continued Interference Not in Corporate Interests\n6.9 The Applicant claims interference is not in corporate interests. The corporate interests were served by the Second Respondent's profitable operations (R34.9M annually). The interference came from: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Domain theft; (6) Warehouse sabotage. Each action occurred after either my debt inquiry (15 May) or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June).\n---\n### 7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 8.4-9.3: FINANCIAL DISCREPANCIES AND MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 8.4 - Discovery of Financial Discrepancies\n7.1 The Applicant claims the accountant discovered discrepancies. The accountant, Mr. Bantjies, is also: (1) Undisclosed trustee; (2) Debtor owing R18.685M; (3) Controller of financial systems; (4) Recipient of the Second Respondent's fraud report on 6 June 2025. Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025. The \"discovery\" occurred after the Second Respondent exposed fraud to the person facilitating it.\n#### AD 8.5 - Accountant's Attendance and Findings\n7.2 The Applicant states Mr. Bantjies attended for provisional tax and VAT submissions. The two years of unallocated expenses (dumped into RegimA Worldwide Distribution on 30 March 2025) occurred while: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled the accounting system using the Applicant's email; (2) Linda (Ms. Farrar's sister) was employed as bookkeeper (Annexure **SF8**); (3) Mr. Bantjies was the accountant. The question arises: why were expenses unallocated for two years if the accountant and bookkeeper were performing their duties?\n#### AD 8.7 - IT Expenses and Tax Problems\n7.3 The Applicant cites IT expenses: 2024 tax year R6,738,007.47; 2025 tax year R2,116,159.47. The Applicant claims these are \"almost entirely unexplainable.\" The context omitted from the founding affidavit is that these expenses supported 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. The IT expenses represent 19.3% of revenue (2024) and 6.1% of revenue (2025)\u2014reasonable for a global e-commerce operation. The Applicant fails to disclose the revenue context.\n#### AD 8.10 - International Expenses and Tax Implications\n7.4 The Applicant claims expenses are \"seemingly international\" and accounts have \"almost exceeded the yearly allowable quota for funds leaving South Africa.\" The Shopify platforms were funded by UK company RegimA Zone Ltd (company 10697009). UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The international expenses were legitimate costs of UK-owned e-commerce operations.\n#### AD 9.2 - Bank Message Regarding International Transfers\n7.5 The Applicant references bank messages about international transfers. The actual international payment flow is demonstrated by Shopify invoices: UK entities (RegimA Zone Ltd) funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The payment direction is UK \u2192 SA, not SA \u2192 UK as the Applicant's affidavit implies.\n#### AD 9.3 - Financial Misconduct Summary\n7.6 The Applicant summarizes alleged misconduct. The documented financial misconduct includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) without the Second Respondent's authority; (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments (Annexure **SF3**, **SF5**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments for this stock (SARS audit email, Annexure **SF4**); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023, unpaid despite Ms. Farrar's false claim to me that it was paid (Annexure **JF2**, **SF6**).\n---\n### 8. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1-10.14: APPLICATION TO DECLARE RESPONDENTS DELINQUENT\n#### AD 10.1 - Relief Sought - Delinquency or Probation\n8.1 The Applicant seeks delinquency or probation orders under Section 162. The evidence establishes grounds for the Applicant's own delinquency: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers in breach of fiduciary duty as co-director; (2) Card cancellation sabotage one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation; (3) False statements about UK payment flows; (4) Abuse of ex parte process through material non-disclosures.\n#### AD 10.3 - Delinquent Conduct of Respondents\n8.2 The Applicant alleges delinquent conduct by the Second Respondent and me. My actual conduct included: (1) Fulfilling fiduciary duty as trustee by investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025); (2) Confronting Ms. Farrar about profiting from proceeds of murder; (3) Being deceived by co-trustees into signing \"Main Trustee\" document (11 Aug 2025, Annexure **JF5**); (4) Being punished with interdict two days later (13 Aug 2025, Annexure **JF6**).\n#### AD 10.4 - Contravention of Companies Act\n8.3 The Applicant alleges Companies Act contraventions. Section 76(3)(b) requires directors to act in good faith and for a proper purpose. The Applicant's actions demonstrate bad faith: (1) Manufactured crisis (card cancellation day after cooperation); (2) Material non-disclosures in ex parte application; (3) False statements about UK operations; (4) Systematic sabotage of profitable businesses.\n#### AD 10.5.2 - Probation Relief Under Section 162\n8.4 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence reveals: Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) commissioned this affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths. Mr. Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery of the fraud the Second Respondent reported.\n#### AD 10.6 - Close Corporations Act - Fiduciary Duties\n8.5 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act fiduciary duties. The Act requires members to manage in the corporation's interest. RegimA Skin Treatments (CC) owes R1,035,000 to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023. Strategic Logistics (CC) lost R5.4M in stock that \"disappeared\"\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory. These transactions were not in the corporations' interests.\n#### AD 10.6.1 - Member's Duty to Manage in Corporation's Interest\n8.6 The Applicant cites duty to manage in corporation's interest. The R5.4M stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics represents 46% of annual sales\u201410 times the historical adjustment. Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments. This transaction was not in Strategic Logistics' interest.\n#### AD 10.6.2 - Member's Duty Not to Exceed Powers\n8.7 The Applicant cites duty not to exceed powers. The unauthorized R900,000 transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) were made without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director. The Applicant exceeded his powers by acting unilaterally.\n#### AD 10.6.3 - Member's Duty to Avoid Conflicts of Interest\n8.8 The Applicant cites duty to avoid conflicts. The evidence reveals multiple conflicts: (1) Mr. Bantjies: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant; (2) Ms. Farrar's son (Adderory) supplying stock to RegimA Skin Treatments while same stock type \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) Villa Via (trust-owned) charging 86% profit margin rent to group; (4) Regimaskin.co.za (owned by Ms. Farrar's son) competing with RegimA operations.\n#### AD 10.7 - Member Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n8.9 The Applicant invokes breach of fiduciary duty liability. The breaches are established: (1) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to the Second Respondent (co-director) by unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries (as trustee) by attacking them with interdict; (3) Mr. Bantjies breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries by dismissing audit request and facilitating fraud.\n#### AD 10.7.1.2 - Liability for Economic Benefit Derived\n8.10 The Applicant cites liability for economic benefit. The economic benefits derived include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (4) 86% profit margin on Villa Via rent; (5) Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za (Adderory).\n#### AD 10.7.1.4 - Liability for Loss Suffered by Corporation\n8.11 The Applicant cites liability for corporate loss. The losses suffered include: (1) RegimA SA: R900K unauthorized transfers, revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025, Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025; (2) RegimA Zone: Customer diversion to competing domain, card cancellation sabotage; (3) Strategic Logistics: R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (4) RegimA Worldwide: Forced to pay 2 years of unallocated expenses from all companies.\n#### AD 10.8 - Disqualification for Misconduct Under Section 47\n8.12 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act Section 47 disqualification. This section applies when a member is guilty of gross negligence or fraud. The R5.4M stock adjustment (46% of sales, 10x historical) in Strategic Logistics, with Ms. Farrar claiming Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments, and the same stock type supplied by Adderory, suggests systematic fraud.\n#### AD 10.8.1 - Declaration of Delinquency as Alternative Relief\n8.13 The Applicant seeks delinquency declaration. The evidence supports declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5): (1) Intentional harm to companies (systematic sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent conduct (card cancellation without notice); (3) Breach of trust (attacking beneficiaries as trustee); (4) Abuse of process (ex parte order based on material non-disclosures and false statements).\n#### AD 10.9 - Mandatory Disqualification Under Section 162(5)\n8.14 The Applicant invokes Section 162(5) mandatory disqualification grounds. These grounds apply to the Applicant's conduct: (1) Intentional harm to companies (R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent harm (card cancellation rendering documentation inaccessible); (3) Breach of trust (trustee attacking beneficiaries).\n#### AD 10.9.2 - Intentional or Grossly Negligent Harm\n8.15 The Applicant alleges intentional or grossly negligent harm by respondents. The intentional harm was inflicted by the Applicant and his co-conspirators: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent cooperates; (2) 7 June: Cards cancelled; (3) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days after my inquiry); (4) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days after my inquiry); (5) 8 July: Warehouse sabotaged; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action followed either my debt inquiry or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure.\n#### AD 10.9.3 - Manner of Acting - Gross Negligence or Misconduct\n8.16 The Applicant alleges gross negligence or misconduct. The gross negligence is demonstrated by: Cancelling 15 business cards without notice, rendering documentation inaccessible, then complaining about missing documentation. This demonstrates consciousness of guilt and bad faith.\n#### AD 10.9.3.1 - Gross Negligence or Wilful Misconduct\n8.17 The Applicant alleges wilful misconduct. The wilful misconduct includes: (1) Systematic revenue diversion (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (2) Data destruction (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Card sabotage (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). This six-month campaign occurred after I investigated fraud and the Second Respondent exposed fraud.\n#### AD 10.9.3.2 - Acquiescence to Fraudulent Acts\n8.18 The Applicant alleges acquiescence to fraud. The acquiescence to fraud includes: (1) Two years of unallocated expenses while Ms. Farrar controlled systems using the Applicant's email and Linda was employed as bookkeeper; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" with Mr. Bantjies allegedly instructing payments; (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate unpaid since Feb 2023; (4) Villa Via 86% profit margin rent extraction.\n#### AD 10.9.3.3 - Party to Omission with Fraudulent Purpose\n8.19 The Applicant alleges omission with fraudulent purpose. The omissions with fraudulent purpose include: (1) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's trustee status from affidavit; (2) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Applicant omitted R34.9M revenue context for IT expenses; (4) Applicant omitted UK \u2192 SA payment flow (claimed opposite); (5) Applicant omitted timeline showing card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation; (6) Applicant omitted my debt inquiry and subsequent retaliation.\n#### AD 10.10 - Probation Under Section 162(7)\n8.20 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162(7). This section applies when conduct is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) I fulfilled fiduciary duty by investigating debt, then was punished with interdict; (2) Second Respondent exposed fraud to accountant, then suffered six-month sabotage campaign; (3) Both excluded from profitable businesses we built.\n#### AD 10.10.2.3 - Oppressive or Prejudicial Exercise of Powers\n8.21 The Applicant alleges oppressive exercise of powers. The oppressive exercise of powers includes: (1) Applicant used trustee powers to attack beneficiaries; (2) Mr. Bantjies used trustee powers to dismiss audit request and facilitate fraud; (3) Applicant used director powers to make unauthorized R900K transfers; (4) Applicant used court process to obtain ex parte order based on material non-disclosures.\n#### AD 10.10.2.4 - Conduct with Oppressive or Prejudicial Result\n8.22 The Applicant alleges conduct with prejudicial result. The prejudicial results include: (1) I was excluded from companies after investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent excluded from R34.9M operations he built; (3) Customers diverted to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son; (4) R900K transferred without authorization; (5) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (6) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate unpaid.\n#### AD 10.10.22 - Business Conducted in Oppressive Manner\n8.23 The Applicant alleges oppressive business conduct. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled all systems using Applicant's email while claiming to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions; (2) Applicant had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems; (3) Two years of expenses unallocated despite employed bookkeeper; (4) Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) dismissed fraud investigation.\n#### AD 10.10.41 - Conduct Inconsistent with Duties\n8.24 The Applicant alleges conduct inconsistent with duties. The conduct inconsistent with duties includes: (1) Trustee attacking beneficiaries (Applicant, Mr. Bantjies); (2) Director making unauthorized transfers (Applicant); (3) Trustee dismissing fraud investigation (Mr. Bantjies); (4) Accountant facilitating fraud while being debtor (Mr. Bantjies); (5) Administrator controlling systems while diverting revenue (Ms. Farrar).\n#### AD 10.13 - Unaccounted Money - Significant Sums\n8.25 The Applicant alleges unaccounted money. The unaccounted money includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023; (4) R1.73 million transferred 11 Sep 2025; (5) Two years of unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide on 30 Mar 2025.\n#### AD 10.14 - Full Extent of Transgressions Not Yet Determined\n8.26 The Applicant claims full extent not yet determined. The full extent includes: (1) Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email; (4) Ms. Farrar's son's competing domain; (5) Adderory's stock supply relationship; (6) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme; (7) Court order seizing Kayla's email during law enforcement investigation.\n---\n### 9. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 11.2-12.4: UK OPERATIONS AND ALLEGED FRAUD\n#### AD 11.2 - UK Head Office - RegimA UK Ltd\n9.1 The Applicant describes UK operations. RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The UK company is the economic owner of the e-commerce operations.\n#### AD 11.3 - Directors of UK Entity\n9.2 The Applicant describes UK directors. The UK company was established by the Second Respondent and Kayla to own and operate the global e-commerce platforms. After Kayla's murder (13 July 2023), the Second Respondent continued managing the operations.\n#### AD 11.4 - Applicant's Role in Operations\n9.3 The Applicant describes his role. The evidence demonstrates the Applicant had no operational role: (1) No access to email (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (4) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's. The Applicant appears to be a figurehead.\n#### AD 11.6 - UK Branch Operations\n9.4 The Applicant describes UK branch operations. The UK company funded SA operations through Shopify subscription payments. Shopify invoices demonstrate UK \u2192 SA payment flow of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The UK company invested in SA operations, not the reverse.\n#### AD 11.8 - UK Financial Concerns\n9.5 The Applicant expresses UK financial concerns. The financial concerns were manufactured: (1) Card cancellation 7 June 2025 disrupted UK funding; (2) Domain theft 29 May 2025 diverted customers; (3) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 destroyed UK-funded operations; (4) Data expungement 22 May 2025 eliminated audit trail.\n#### AD 12.1 - UK Branch Non-Payment and Fraud Concerns\n9.6 The Applicant alleges UK branch non-payment and fraud. The Shopify invoices prove the opposite: UK entities funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). UK bank transactions corroborate the invoices (Annexure **DF8**). The Applicant's statement is demonstrably false.\n#### AD 12.2 - Misappropriation Leading to Insolvency Risk\n9.7 The Applicant alleges misappropriation leading to insolvency. The actual insolvency risk was created by: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (3) Data expungement (22 May); (4) Card cancellation (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). Despite six months of sabotage, the Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied.\n#### AD 12.3 - Purpose of Court Application\n9.8 The Applicant states the purpose is to prevent further harm. The actual purpose appears to be: (1) Punish me for investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May); (2) Punish Second Respondent for exposing Villa Via fraud (6 June); (3) Seize control of R34.9M operations Second Respondent built; (4) Prevent forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and the systematic fraud.\n#### AD 12.4 - Alternative Roles for Wife and Son\n9.9 The Applicant suggests alternative roles for the Second Respondent and me. The evidence demonstrates: (1) I fulfilled trustee duties by investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent built and managed R34.9M profitable operations; (3) Both were systematically sabotaged after investigating/exposing fraud; (4) Both were attacked with interdict by co-trustees; (5) I was included in interdict two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document.\n---\n### 10. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 13.2-13.8: REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERDICTORY RELIEF\n#### AD 13.2 - Clear Right Not to Be Prejudiced\n10.1 The Applicant claims clear right not to be prejudiced. The Applicant has no clear right: (1) He manufactured the crisis (card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (2) He made unauthorized R900K transfers; (3) He had alternative remedies as trustee with \"additional powers\"; (4) He obtained order through material non-disclosures (Mr. Bantjies's trustee status, debtor status, timeline manipulation, UK payment flow misrepresentation).\n#### AD 13.2.2 - Injury Sustained and Apprehension of Further Harm\n10.2 The Applicant claims injury and apprehension of harm. The Applicant suffered no injury he didn't inflict on himself: (1) Card cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible; (2) Unauthorized transfers depleted accounts; (3) Revenue diversions reduced cash flow; (4) Warehouse sabotage destroyed operations. The apprehension of further harm was manufactured to justify ex parte relief.\n#### AD 13.3 - Reasonable Apprehension of Irreparable Harm\n10.3 The Applicant claims reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm. The irreparable harm was inflicted by the Applicant's six-month sabotage campaign: (1) R34.9M operations destroyed (93.3% revenue collapse); (2) Customer relationships diverted to competing domain; (3) Audit data expunged (100% loss); (4) Documentation rendered inaccessible; (5) Accounts emptied. The Second Respondent and I suffered irreparable harm, not the Applicant.\n#### AD 13.4 - Interdicts Essential for Corporation Survival\n10.4 The Applicant claims interdicts essential for survival. The corporations were profitable under the Second Respondent's management (R34.9M annually). The survival threat came from the Applicant's sabotage: (1) Unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data destruction; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Excluding the Second Respondent and me threatened survival, not ensured it.\n#### AD 13.5 - Balance of Convenience Favours Granting Relief\n10.5 The Applicant claims balance of convenience favors relief. The balance overwhelmingly favors the Second Respondent and me: (1) We built and managed profitable operations; (2) We investigated and exposed fraud; (3) We were systematically sabotaged for doing so; (4) We substituted personal cards to prevent business collapse; (5) We support independent forensic audit. The Applicant obtained relief through material non-disclosures and false statements.\n#### AD 13.8 - Other Relief Sought in Part A\n10.6 The Applicant seeks additional relief. The relief was obtained ex parte based on: (1) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Omitting timeline showing card cancellation day after cooperation; (4) Falsely claiming UK owes SA (opposite is true); (5) Omitting R34.9M revenue context; (6) Omitting my debt inquiry and retaliation pattern.\n---\n### 11. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1-14.5: FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND FORENSIC AUDIT\n#### AD 14.1 - Financial Constraints on Respondents\n11.1 The Applicant seeks financial constraints on the Second Respondent and me. The financial constraints were already imposed through sabotage: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Despite six months of sabotage, the Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors.\n#### AD 14.3 - Constraint to Prevent Financial Prejudice\n11.2 The Applicant seeks constraints to prevent prejudice. The prejudice was inflicted by the Applicant: (1) RegimA SA account opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 (Feb-Mar 2025); (2) 169 customer deposits R566,598.57 proving active trade; (3) R1.73M transferred 11 Sep 2025; (4) R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage.\n#### AD 14.4 - Forensic Audit Necessity and Remuneration\n11.3 The Applicant seeks forensic audit. The Second Respondent and I support independent forensic audit by an impartial party. Such audit would reveal: (1) Mr. Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant); (2) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme (Strategic Logistics \u2192 Adderory \u2192 RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (4) Two years unallocated expenses; (5) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (6) Revenue diversion scheme; (7) Ms. Farrar's control of systems using Applicant's email.\n#### AD 14.5 - Request for Relief Under Part B\n11.4 The Applicant requests Part B relief. The relief should include: (1) Setting aside ex parte order obtained through material non-disclosures; (2) Independent forensic audit; (3) Investigation of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts; (4) Investigation of R5.4M stock \"disappearance\"; (5) Recovery of R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (6) Investigation of Ms. Farrar's control and Adderory's role; (7) Consideration of Applicant's delinquency under Section 162(5).\n---\n### 12. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1-16.12: DISCOVERY AND URGENCY\n#### AD 16.1 - Discovery of Respondents' Conduct\n12.1 The Applicant claims discovery of conduct in mid-June 2025. The actual discovery timeline: (1) 15 May: I discovered R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (2) 6 June: Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies; (3) 7 June: Applicant cancelled cards (day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (4) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed audit request. The Applicant's \"discovery\" was actually consciousness of guilt after the Second Respondent exposed fraud to Mr. Bantjies.\n#### AD 16.2 - R600,000 Transfer as Trigger for Action\n12.2 The Applicant cites R600,000 transfer (later corrected to R500,000) as trigger. The actual triggers were: (1) 15 May: I confronted Ms. Farrar about R1,035,000 debt and \"profiting from proceeds of murder\"; (2) 6 June: Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed audit request. The R500,000 transfer is a pretext.\n#### AD 16.5 - Unawareness of Urgent Application Process\n12.3 The Applicant claims unawareness of urgent process. The Applicant had access to legal advice and Mr. Bantjies as Commissioner of Oaths. The delay from mid-June to August contradicts urgency. The actual urgency appears to be preventing forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and systematic fraud.\n#### AD 16.6 - Delay Would Have Been Avoided\n12.4 The Applicant claims delay would have been avoided if he knew the process. The two-month delay (mid-June to August) contradicts urgency. The timing suggests: (1) Waiting to see if Second Respondent's audit request would proceed; (2) Coordinating with Mr. Bantjies (who dismissed audit request 10 June); (3) Preparing my punishment (included in interdict 13 Aug, two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document 11 Aug).\n#### AD 16.8 - State of Shock and Delayed Response\n12.5 The Applicant claims state of shock. The Applicant was not in shock\u2014he was executing a systematic sabotage campaign: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping; (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 7 Jun: Card cancellation; (6) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (7) 11 Sep: Account emptying. This is not shock\u2014this is systematic execution.\n#### AD 16.10 - Attorney Consultation Timeline\n12.6 The Applicant describes attorney consultation. The consultation occurred after: (1) My debt inquiry (15 May); (2) Data expungement (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June); (5) Card cancellation (7 June); (6) Mr. Bantjies's audit dismissal (10 June). The legal action was retaliation, not discovery.\n#### AD 16.12 - Need for Urgent Court Assistance\n12.7 The Applicant claims need for urgent assistance. The Applicant had alternative remedies: (1) Trustee with \"additional powers\" as Founder; (2) Could have conducted audit as trustee; (3) Could have consulted with co-trustee (me) instead of attacking me; (4) Could have consulted with co-trustee Mr. Bantjies (who was facilitating the fraud). The Applicant chose ex parte process to avoid disclosure of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and systematic sabotage.\n---\n### 13. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 17.3-17.4: EX PARTE BASIS\n#### AD 17.3 - Ex Parte Basis for Application\n13.1 The Applicant justifies ex parte application. The ex parte process was abused through material non-disclosures: (1) Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Timeline manipulation (card cancellation day after cooperation); (4) UK payment flow misrepresentation (claimed SA \u2192 UK, actually UK \u2192 SA); (5) R34.9M revenue context omission; (6) My debt inquiry and retaliation pattern; (7) Second Respondent's fraud exposure and retaliation pattern; (8) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email; (9) Adderory's competing domain; (10) R5.4M stock \"disappearance.\"\n#### AD 17.4 - Urgency Justifies Ex Parte Relief\n13.2 The Applicant claims urgency justifies ex parte relief. The urgency was manufactured: (1) Two-month delay contradicts urgency; (2) Card cancellation day after cooperation shows consciousness of guilt; (3) Systematic sabotage from Feb-Sep shows premeditation; (4) I was included two days after signing document, showing coordination; (5) Alternative remedies available as trustee. The ex parte relief was obtained to prevent the Second Respondent and me from exposing the material non-disclosures and systematic fraud.\n---\n### 14. RESPONSE TO REMAINING AD PARAGRAPHS (18.3, 20, 22, 40.9.4, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, 88)\n#### AD 18.3 - Continual Unauthorized Fund Transfers\n14.1 The Applicant alleges continual unauthorized transfers. The unauthorized transfers were made by the Applicant: R450,000 on 14 Feb 2025 + R450,000 on 15 Feb 2025 = R900,000 total from RegimA SA without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director. RegimA SA account: opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 within one month despite 169 customer deposits R566,598.57.\n#### AD 20 - First and Second Respondent Details\n14.2 The Applicant provides the Second Respondent's and my details.

The gross abuse includes: (1) Applicant made R900K unauthorized transfers as director; (2) Applicant cancelled cards without notice as director; (3) Applicant used trustee position to attack beneficiaries; (4) Mr. Bantjies used trustee position to dismiss audit and facilitate fraud; (5) Ms. Farrar used administrative position to control systems, divert revenue, and facilitate son's competing domain.\n#### AD 44 - Applicant Identity Details\n14.5 The Applicant confirms identity. The Applicant's actual position: (1) No access to email (pete@regima.com controlled by Ms. Farrar); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (4) Debtor to Mr. Bantjies (R18.685M due May 2026); (5) Figurehead while Ms. Farrar claims to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions.\n#### AD 50 - Registered Address Details\n14.6 The Applicant provides address: 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview. This is also my address. The Applicant attacked me (co-trustee, beneficiary) with interdict two days after I signed \"Main Trustee\" document, punishing me for investigating R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate and supporting the Second Respondent.\n#### AD 74 - Timeline Context\n14.7 The Applicant provides timeline context. The actual timeline: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping (12-hour deadline); (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 15 May: My debt inquiry; (6) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days later); (7) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days later); (8) 6 Jun: Second Respondent's fraud exposure; (9) 7 Jun: Cards cancelled (1 day later); (10) 10 Jun: Audit dismissed; (11) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotaged; (12) 11 Aug: I sign document; (13) 13 Aug: I included in interdict (2 days later); (14) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied.\n#### AD 78 - Accountant's Office Visit and Discovery\n14.8 The Applicant describes Mr. Bantjies's office visit. The visit occurred after: (1) Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025; (2) Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) Applicant cancelled cards on 7 June 2025 (day after Second Respondent's cooperation). Mr. Bantjies \"discovered\" irregularities after the Second Respondent reported fraud to him. Mr. Bantjies then dismissed audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\"\n#### AD 83 - Irregular Payments Discovery\n14.9 The Applicant describes discovery of irregular payments. The irregular payments include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers by Applicant (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics (same type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments (SARS audit email); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023 (Ms. Farrar falsely claimed paid to me on 15 May 2025).\n#### AD 88 - Follow-up Actions\n14.10 The Applicant describes follow-up actions. The follow-up actions include: (1) 7 Jun: Card cancellation (day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (2) 10 Jun: Mr. Bantjies dismisses audit; (3) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (4) 11 Aug: I was deceived into signing document; (5) 13 Aug: I was included in interdict; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action was retaliation against me (15 May debt inquiry) and the Second Respondent (6 Jun fraud exposure).\n---\n### 15. PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n15.1 I respectfully request that this Honourable Court:\n15.1.1 Set aside the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025 on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n15.1.2 Dismiss the Applicant's application for delinquency or probation orders against the Second Respondent and me.\n15.1.3 Grant a counter-application declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008, on the grounds of:\n- Intentional harm to companies through systematic sabotage;\n- Grossly negligent conduct in card cancellation without notice;\n- Breach of fiduciary duty to beneficiaries as trustee;\n- Abuse of court process through material non-disclosures and false statements.\n15.1.4 Order an independent forensic audit by an impartial auditor to investigate:\n- Mr. Bantjies's conflicts of interest (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant);\n- R5.4 million stock transfer pricing scheme;\n- R1,035,000 debt to Kayla Pretorius's estate;\n- Two years of unallocated expenses;\n- Unauthorized R900,000 transfers;\n- Revenue diversion scheme;\n- Ms. Farrar's control of systems and Adderory's role.\n15.1.5 Order the Applicant to pay the costs of this application on the scale as between attorney and client.\n15.1.6 Grant such further and/or alternative relief as this Honourable Court deems fit.\n---\n### 16. CONCLUSION\n16.1 The evidence presented in this affidavit demonstrates that I fulfilled my fiduciary duties as a trustee by investigating a substantial debt owed to a deceased beneficiary's estate. I confronted Ms. Farrar about this debt on 15 May 2025, stating that keeping the funds would constitute profiting from the proceeds of murder.\n16.2 Within seven days of my inquiry, Shopify data was expunged, eliminating the audit trail. Within 14 days, a competing domain was registered by Ms. Farrar's son's company, diverting customers from the Second Respondent's operations.\n16.3 On 11 August 2025, I was deceived by my co-trustees into signing a \"Main Trustee\" document that backdated the Applicant's designation to 1 July 2025. Two days later, on 13 August 2025, the Applicant and Mr. Bantjies included me in this interdict.\n16.4 The ex parte order was obtained through material non-disclosures, including Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status, his R18.685 million debt to the trust, the timeline showing card cancellation one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation, false statements about UK payment flows, and the omission of the R34.9 million revenue context.\n16.5 The Second Respondent and I support an independent forensic audit by an impartial party. Such an audit would reveal the systematic fraud, conflicts of interest, and abuse of process that underlie this application.\n16.6 I respectfully submit that the balance of convenience overwhelmingly favors setting aside the ex parte order and granting the relief sought in this affidavit.\n---\n**SIGNED at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025.**\n---\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**  \nFirst Respondent\n---\n**THUS SIGNED AND SWORN TO before me at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025, the Deponent having acknowledged that she knows and understands the contents of this Affidavit, that she has no objection to taking the prescribed oath, and that she considers the oath to be binding on her conscience.**\n---\n**COMMISSIONER OF OATHS**\n---\n## LIST OF ANNEXURES\n**JF1:** Trust deed and trustee documentation  \n**JF2:** Email correspondence re R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025)  \n**JF3:** Rynette's false statement documentation  \n**JF4:** Domain registration records (regimaskin.co.za, 29 May 2025)  \n**JF5:** \"Main Trustee\" document (signed 11 Aug 2025, backdated to 1 July 2025)  \n**JF6:** Interdict order (13 Aug 2025)  \n**JF7:** Personal card statements (substitution to prevent collapse)  \n**JF8:** Email from Gee re domain diversion (20 June 2025)\n**DF1:** Shopify operations overview (51+ stores, R34.9M revenue)  \n**DF2:** Villa Via fraud analysis (86% profit margin)  \n**DF3:** Email correspondence with Bantjies (6 June 2025)  \n**DF4:** Card cancellation records (7 June 2025)  \n**DF5-DF7:** Shopify invoices (UK \u2192 SA payment flow, R84,661+ annually)  \n**DF8:** UK bank transactions (corroborating Shopify payments)  \n**DF9:** Unauthorized transfer records (R450K + R450K = R900K, 14-15 Feb 2025)  \n**DF10:** RegimA SA account statements (opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08)  \n**DF11:** Customer deposit records (169 deposits, R566,598.57)  \n**DF12:** Revenue diversion documentation (1 Mar, 14 Apr, 11 Sep 2025)  \n**DF13:** Warehouse sabotage instruction (8 July 2025)  \n**DF14:** Expense dumping documentation (30 Mar 2025)\n**SF1:** Bantjies debt documentation (R18.685M, investment payout schedule)  \n**SF2:** Sage screenshots (Rynette using pete@regima.com, June & Aug 2025)  \n**SF3:** Strategic Logistics R5.4M stock adjustment documentation  \n**SF4:** SARS audit email (Rynette claiming Bantjies instructed payments)  \n**SF5:** Adderory company registration and stock supply documentation  \n**SF6:** Kayla Pretorius estate documentation (R1,035,000 debt)  \n**SF7:** Court order seizing Kayla's email account  \n**SF8:** Linda employment records (bookkeeper)\n---\n**END OF AFFIDAVIT**",

DANNY STILL WORKING ON ONE\n\nCase 2025-137857: Coherent Story Arc\nRepository: cogpy/canima\nCreated: November 2, 2025\nPurpose: Integrate Jax's AD notes into the overall narrative structure\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThis document integrates Jacqueline Faucitt's detailed commentary on Peter's founding\naffidavit (AD paragraphs) into a coherent narrative framework that reveals the systematic\nnature of the fraud, retaliation, and abuse of process.\nPART I: THE NARRATIVE ARCHITECTURE\nThe Central Story Arc\nAct I: Building Success (2017-2024)\n\u2022 Jacqui builds RegimA Skin Treatments into one of South Africa's most successful skin\ntreatment companies (33 years)\n\u2022 Daniel and Kayla build 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9M annually\n\u2022 UK company (RegimA Zone Ltd) funds SA operations with R84,661+ annually\n\u2022 Profitable operations across multiple entities\nAct II: Discovery and Confrontation (March-May 2025)\n\u2022 March 30, 2025: Two years of unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide\nwith 12-hour deadline\n\u2022 May 15, 2025: Jacqui confronts Rynette about R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate\n(\"profiting from proceeds of murder\")\n\u2022 May 22, 2025: Shopify audit trail becomes unavailable (7 days after confrontation)\n\u2022 May 29, 2025: Domain regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory (14 days after\nconfrontation)\n\u2022 June 6, 2025: Daniel exposes Villa Via fraud to Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator)\nAct III: Systematic Retaliation (June-August 2025)\n\u2022 June 7, 2025: 15 company cards cancelled (1 day after fraud exposure)\n\u2022 June 10, 2025: Bantjies dismisses audit request (4 days after fraud exposure)\n\u2022 July 8, 2025: Warehouse operations stopped, destroying R34.9M business\n\u2022 August 11, 2025: Jacqui deceived into signing \"Main Trustee\" document\n\u2022 August 13, 2025: Interdict granted against Jacqui and Daniel (2 days after document\nsigning)\nAct IV: The Ex Parte Deception (August 2025)\n\u2022 Material non-disclosures in founding affidavit\n\u2022 False statements about UK payment flows\n\u2022 Timeline manipulation to create false urgency\n\u2022 Bantjies certifies affidavit despite being undisclosed trustee and R18.685M debtor\nAct V: Final Sabotage (September 2025)\n\u2022 September 11, 2025: Company accounts emptied (R1.73M transferred)\n\u2022 Daniel was still managing to pay creditors despite 6 months of sabotage\n\u2022 Accounts emptied to prevent continued operations\nPART II: THE NETWORK OF CONTROL\nThe Power Structure\nBantjies: The Hidden Hand\n\u2022 Undisclosed trustee of Faucitt Family Trust\n\u2022 Debtor owing R18.685M to the trust\n\u2022 Accountant for all RegimA companies\n\u2022 Controller of financial systems\n\u2022 Commissioner of Oaths who certified Peter's affidavit\n\u2022 Dismissed Daniel's audit request on June 10, 2025\n\u2022 Allegedly instructed Rynette to make substantial payments (per SARS audit email)\nRynette Farrar: The Administrator\n\u2022 Controlled accounting system using Peter's email (pete@regima.com)\n\u2022 Controlled all bank accounts\n\u2022 Made false statement to Jacqui that R1,035,000 debt was paid\n\u2022 Sister Linda employed as bookkeeper (yet expenses unallocated for 2 years)\n\u2022 Claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions, not Peter's\n\u2022 Impersonated Peter using his email address\nAdderory (Rynette's Son): The Beneficiary\n\u2022 Registered competing domain regimaskin.co.za on May 29, 2025\n\u2022 Supplied stock to RegimA Skin Treatments\n\u2022 Same stock type as R5.4M that \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics\n\u2022 Received customer diversions via email instructions (June 20, 2025)\nPeter: The Figurehead\n\u2022 No access to email (controlled by Rynette)\n\u2022 No access to bank accounts (controlled by Rynette)\n\u2022 No access to accounting systems (controlled by Rynette)\n\u2022 Does not use a computer\n\u2022 Does not do any banking\n\u2022 Made unauthorized R900K transfers without Daniel's authority\n\u2022 Cancelled 15 cards secretly without informing Jacqui or Daniel\nPART III: JAX'S COMMENTARY INTEGRATION\nSection 4: Urgency and Delay (AD 7-7.20)\nJax's Core Arguments:\n1. No Urgency for Applicant\n\u2022 Peter claimed urgency only in July when Jacqui and Daniel were trying to resolve\nSARS audit\n\u2022 Complete mischaracterization to claim urgency and manipulate timeline proximity\n\u2022 67-day delay between Daniel's reports (June 6) and interdict (August 13) contradicts\nurgency\n2. Actual Urgency for Respondents\n\u2022 Financial impact due to Peter's actions\n\u2022 Rynette (bookkeeper) doing all banking transactions daily\n\u2022 Jacqui and Daniel unable to see any accounts\n\u2022 Massive impact on RegimA Skin Treatments from incompetent bookkeeper\n3. Jacqui's Essential Role\n\u2022 CEO who launched RegimA Skin Treatments 33 years ago\n\u2022 Built company into one of SA's most successful skin treatment companies\n\u2022 Won all major industry awards\n\u2022 Every word ever written about RegimA written by Jacqui\n\u2022 Treated thousands of patients referred from leading plastic surgeons\n\u2022 Only person at RegimA office who can treat patients\n\u2022 Essential for UK and European business as Responsible Person\n4. Price Increase Sabotage\n\u2022 Annual price increase usually done by Daniel (mathematician)\n\u2022 Bookkeeper did it instead and caused \"dreadful harm\" to the structure\n\u2022 Demonstrates incompetence and operational damage\n5. Card Cancellations\n\u2022 All card cancellations carried out by Peter alone in secret\n\u2022 Nobody informed Jacqui or Daniel\n\u2022 Peter cancelled all worldwide FNB cards, specifically Jacqui and Dan's cards\n\u2022 Payments defaulted because of secret cancellations\n6. Rynette's Interference\n\u2022 Took RegimA logo and IP information and put it in her son's name\n\u2022 Sent emails instructing RegimA database not to use regima.zone email addresses\n\u2022 Used new addresses she put in place (regimaskin.co.za)\n\u2022 Did this without informing Jacqui or Daniel\n\u2022 Cancelled regima.zone email addresses\n\u2022 Impersonated Peter using pete@regima.com\n7. System Cancellations\n\u2022 Peter instructed Rynette to cancel all Shopify and other systems\n\u2022 These systems had been set up to automate sales\n\u2022 Were working very well (same system UK successfully uses)\n\u2022 Deliberate sabotage of profitable operations\nSection 5: Financial Discrepancies (AD 8.4-9.3)\nJax's Core Arguments:\n1. Bantjies's Conflict of Interest (AD 8.4)\n\u2022 Accountant who \"discovered\" discrepancies is also:\n\u2022 Undisclosed trustee\n\u2022 Debtor owing R18.685M\n\u2022 Controller of financial systems\n\u2022 Recipient of Daniel's fraud report (June 6, 2025)\n\u2022 Dismissed Daniel's audit request on June 10, 2025\n\u2022 \"Discovery\" occurred after Daniel exposed fraud to the person facilitating it\n2.

manufactured crisis\n- Section 76(3)(b) of Companies Act - bad faith and improper purpose\n- Section 162(5) of Companies Act - grounds for Peter's delinquency\n- Section 9(1) of Trust Property Control Act - trustee duties\n- Requirements for interdictory relief (clear right, harm, balance of convenience)\n### Strategic Recommendations\n- Emphasize manufactured crisis argument\n- Highlight retaliation pattern\n- Leverage Shopify invoice evidence for perjury\n- Support independent forensic audit\n- Pursue counter-application for Peter's delinquency\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nSent: Saturday, 01 November 2025 14:30\nTo: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.com>; Daniel Faucitt <d@rzo.io>; regizone <regizone@proton.me>\nSubject: AD NOTES - JACQUELINE FAUCITT \n## ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT: JACQUELINE FAUCITT\n**IN THE HIGH COURT OF SOUTH AFRICA**  \n**GAUTENG DIVISION, PRETORIA**\n**Case No:** 2025-137857\n**In the matter between:**\n**PETER ANDREW FAUCITT** \u2014 Applicant\nand\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT** \u2014 First Respondent  \n**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT** \u2014 Second Respondent  \n*(and others)*\n---\n## I, THE UNDERSIGNED\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**\ndo hereby make oath and state that:\n---\n### 1. INTRODUCTION AND CAPACITY\n1.1 I am the First Respondent in this matter, an adult female, and a South African citizen residing at 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview.\n1.2 I am a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust (IT 3651/2013) and a Beneficiary of the same trust. I am also a co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (2017/087935/07) and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (2011/005722/07), both of which are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust.\n1.3 The facts deposed to in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and belief, save where the context indicates otherwise, and are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\n1.4 Where I make legal submissions, I do so on the advice of my legal representatives.\n---\n### 2. PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT\n2.1 This affidavit is filed in response to the Applicant's founding affidavit and the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025.\n2.2 I oppose the relief sought by the Applicant and seek to have the ex parte order set aside on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n2.3 I address each of the Applicant's allegations in the order they appear in the founding affidavit, following the AD paragraph sequence.\n---\n### 3. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 1-3.13: PARTIES AND STRUCTURE\n#### AD 1 - Director Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n3.1 The Applicant invokes provisions relating to director liability for breach of fiduciary duty. I note that the accounting system used to track the alleged breaches was controlled by Rynette Farrar using the Applicant's email address (pete@regima.com), as evidenced by Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 (Annexure **SF2**). The Applicant himself had no access to this system.\n#### AD 1.3 - Applicant's Personal Details and Declaration\n3.2 The Applicant's personal details are noted. I observe that this affidavit was commissioned by Danie Jacobus Bantjies, identified as \"our accountant.\" The full extent of Mr. Bantjies's roles will become apparent through the evidence presented herein.\n#### AD 2 - Company Business Conduct Requirements\n3.3 The Applicant alleges reckless or grossly negligent business conduct. The financial performance of the companies demonstrates the contrary. The Second Respondent and his late partner, Kayla Pretorius, built 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. RegimA SA operates 25 stores with R8.5 million turnover, while RegimA Zone operates 26 stores with R26.4 million turnover. The businesses were highly profitable under the Second Respondent's management.\n#### AD 2.4 - Parties to the Application - Introduction\n3.4 The Applicant introduces the parties. The corporate structure reveals that certain entities are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust, which has three trustees. Two are identified in the founding affidavit: the Applicant and myself. The third trustee's identity was not disclosed to the beneficiaries until recently.\n#### AD 3 - Court Order for Probation of Directors/Members\n3.5 The Applicant seeks probation orders under Section 162 of the Companies Act. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence will demonstrate that the accountant who allegedly \"discovered\" the irregularities has multiple undisclosed roles that create impermissible conflicts.\n#### AD 3.2 - Respondents - Wife\n3.6 I am correctly identified as the Applicant's wife and First Respondent. On 15 May 2025, I confronted Rynette Farrar regarding a debt of R1,035,000 owed by RegimA Skin Treatments CC to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd since February 2023 (Annexure **JF2**). These funds were part of Kayla Pretorius's estate. I informed Ms. Farrar that keeping these funds would constitute profiting from the proceeds of murder. This confrontation proved significant in the events that followed.\n#### AD 3.4 - Respondents - Son\n3.7 The Second Respondent is correctly identified as the Applicant's son. On 6 June 2025, the Second Respondent cooperated with the Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports to the accountant regarding Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC, which is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust (Annexure **DF3**). The Second Respondent unknowingly reported fraud to one of the perpetrators.\n#### AD 3.4.2 - Third Respondent - RegimA Skin Treatments\n3.8 RegimA Skin Treatments CC (B1992/005371/23) owes R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, part of Kayla Pretorius's estate, since February 2023. When I raised this debt on 15 May 2025, Ms. Farrar claimed it was paid\u2014a statement I have since determined to be false. RegimA Skin Treatments receives stock from Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure **SF5**).\n#### AD 3.6 - Fourth Respondent - Regim A UK\n3.9 RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). This contradicts claims made later in the founding affidavit regarding UK entities owing money to SA operations.\n#### AD 3.6.1 - Fifth Respondent - Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC\n3.10 Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC (1996/004451/23) is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. Financial analysis reveals an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group\u2014an excessive profit extraction (Annexure **DF2**). This was the fraud the Second Respondent reported to the accountant on 6 June 2025.\n#### AD 3.6.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Villa Via Arcadia\n3.11 Property registration confirms trust ownership. The trust has three trustees, but only two were known to the beneficiaries at the time of this application.\n#### AD 3.7 - Sixth Respondent - Strategic Logistics CC\n3.12 Strategic Logistics CC (2008/136496/23) experienced a R5.4 million stock adjustment in 2024\u2014stock that allegedly \"just disappeared\" (Annexure **SF3**). This represents 46% of annual sales (R5.4M on R11.3M sales) and is 10 times the prior year's adjustment. The stock type matches inventory supplied by Adderory (Pty) Ltd to RegimA Skin Treatments.\n#### AD 3.7.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Strategic Logistics\n3.13 Property registration documents are noted. In a SARS audit email concerning the R5.4M stock adjustment, Ms. Farrar claimed that Danie Bantjies instructed her to make the substantial payments related to this transaction (Annexure **SF4**).\n#### AD 3.8 - Seventh Respondent - FirstRand Bank (FNB)\n3.14 FNB holds accounts for the companies. On 14 and 15 February 2025, unauthorized transfers of R450,000 each (R900,000 total) were made from RegimA SA's FNB account without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director (Annexure **DF9**). The account opened with R997,597.94 and closed at R5,284.08 within one month, despite 169 customer deposits totaling R566,598.57 proving active trade (Annexure **DF10**, **DF11**).\n#### AD 3.9 - Eighth and Ninth Respondents\n3.15 ABSA Bank and CIPC are cited. Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution began with an ABSA bank letter dated 14 April 2025 (Annexure **DF12**).\n#### AD 3.11 - Reference to Respondents as Wife and Son\n3.16 The Applicant refers to the Second Respondent and me as \"my wife\" and \"my son.\" Both of us are beneficiaries of the Faucitt Family Trust. I am also a co-trustee. The Trust Property Control Act, 57 of 1988, Section 9(1) requires trustees to act with care, diligence, and skill in the interests of beneficiaries.\n#### AD 3.13 - Court Jurisdiction and Identity Confirmation\n3.17 Jurisdiction is confirmed. The affidavit was commissioned by Danie Bantjies, who signed as \"Commissioner of Oaths.\" Mr. Bantjies's accounting firm is \"Bantjes and Company.\" His full relationship to the trust and companies will be revealed through the evidence presented herein.\n---\n### 4. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTANT DETAILS - BANTJIES CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n#### AD 4 - Accountant Details - Bantjes and Company\n4.1 The Applicant identifies \"our accountant\" as Danie Jacobus Bantjies of \"Bantjes and Company,\" who attended the office in mid-June 2025. What the Applicant does not disclose are the following material facts:\n4.1.1 Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust\u2014a status that was unknown to the beneficiaries, the Second Respondent and myself, until recently.\n4.1.2 Mr. Bantjies is a debtor to the trust, owing R18.685 million on an investment payout schedule with payments due in May 2026, May 2027, and May 2029 (Annexure **SF1**).\n4.1.3 Mr. Bantjies controls the financial systems and gave instructions to Ms. Farrar for multi-million rand transactions, as evidenced by emails (Annexure **SF4**).\n4.1.4 Mr. Bantjies was \"running the companies\" when the Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud on 6 June 2025.\n4.1.5 Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\"\n4.2 This creates an impermissible conflict of interest: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant + Company Controller. Mr. Bantjies had a direct financial interest in preventing discovery of the fraud the Second Respondent reported.\n---\n### 5. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1-6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE\n#### AD 6.1 - Relationships Between Parties\n5.1 The Applicant describes family and corporate relationships. The evidence demonstrates a different control structure. Ms. Farrar controlled all bank accounts (the Applicant had no access), controlled the Sage accounting system using the Applicant's email (pete@regima.com), and claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions rather than the Applicant's (Annexure **SF2**). Ms. Farrar's sister, Linda, was employed as bookkeeper, yet two years of expenses remained unallocated until 30 March 2025 (Annexure **SF8**).\n#### AD 6.3 - Directors and Members of Respondent Entities\n5.2 The Applicant describes directorships. The Second Respondent and I are co-directors of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd. RegimA Worldwide Distribution is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. On 30 March 2025, Ms. Farrar and the Applicant dumped two years of unallocated expenses into RegimA Worldwide Distribution and demanded the Second Respondent sign off within 12 hours for SARS VAT and Annual Accounts (Annexure **DF14**). The Second Respondent used this deadline extension (until 6 June) to finalize reports and uncover the Villa Via fraud.\n#### AD 6.5 - Banking and Registration of Respondent Entities\n5.3 The Applicant describes banking arrangements. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to any bank accounts; (2) Ms. Farrar controlled all accounts; (3) Revenue diversion for RegimA SA started 1 March 2025; (4) Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution started 14 April 2025 (ABSA bank letter); (5) On 11 September 2025, R1.73 million was transferred from accounts (Annexure **DF12**).\n---\n### 6. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7-7.20: URGENCY AND ALLEGED MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 7 - Urgency and Delay Considerations\n6.1 The Applicant claims urgency. The timeline reveals: (1) Alleged discovery mid-June 2025; (2) Application filed August 2025; (3) Two-month delay contradicts urgency. The actual urgency relates to the Second Respondent's fraud exposure on 6 June and my debt inquiry on 15 May.\n#### AD 7.3 - Urgency Details\n6.2 The Applicant claims the accountant noted \"numerous discrepancies\" and \"irregular payments\" in mid-June 2025. Timeline analysis reveals: 6 June 2025 (Second Respondent provides comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies), 7 June 2025 (Applicant cancels 15 UK business cards without notice). The card cancellation occurred one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation, not \"following\" any discovery. This demonstrates that the Applicant created the problem he now complains about.\n#### AD 7.6 - Financial Impact of Misconduct\n6.3 The Applicant alleges financial impact. The actual financial sabotage included: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) Revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025; (3) Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025 (100% audit data loss, seven days after my confrontation with Ms. Farrar); (4) Card cancellation 7 June 2025; (5) Domain theft 29 May 2025 (regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory, 14 days after my confrontation, Annexure **JF4**); (6) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 (R34.9M operations destroyed).\n#### AD 7.8 - Continuing Harm to Corporations\n6.4 The Applicant claims continuing harm. The harm was systematically inflicted. An email from Gee dated 20 June 2025 states she was instructed to send a \"don't use regima.zone only use regimaskin.co.za\" email (Annexure **JF8**). The domain regimaskin.co.za is owned by Adderory (Pty) Ltd (Ms. Farrar's son's company), not by RegimA. This diverted customers from the Second Respondent's platforms to a competing domain controlled by Ms. Farrar's family.\n#### AD 7.10 - Card Cancellations and Service Interruptions\n6.5 The Applicant claims he cancelled cards in June 2025 \"following\" the accountant's discovery and requested invoices from the Second Respondent. Timeline evidence demonstrates: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent provides comprehensive reports; (2) 7 June: Applicant cancels UK cards (5191, 5225) paying for Shopify subscriptions (Annexure **DF4**); (3) Cards cancelled one day after cooperation, not after any discovery. The cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible (card-based authentication), then the Applicant complained about missing documentation.\n#### AD 7.13 - Domain and Service Halts Due to Card Cancellations\n6.6 The Applicant claims subscriptions were halted due to card cancellations. To prevent business collapse, the Second Respondent substituted his personal card (1927) for RegimA SA and I substituted my personal card (3212) for RegimA Zone (Annexure **JF7**). Meanwhile, the competing domain regimaskin.co.za was actively diverting customers.\n#### AD 7.16 - Son's Interference with Business Operations\n6.7 The Applicant alleges the Second Respondent interfered with operations. The evidence demonstrates the Second Respondent built and managed 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually (Annexure **DF1**). The Second Respondent's partner, Kayla Pretorius, co-built these operations before her murder on 13 July 2023. After Kayla's death, a court order was obtained to seize her email account (kayp@rzo.io), which interfered with a law enforcement investigation that had instructed a freeze on the account (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.18 - Email and Account Access Interference\n6.8 The Applicant claims the Second Respondent restricted email access. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to his own email (pete@regima.com)\u2014controlled by Ms. Farrar; (2) Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 show Ms. Farrar using the Applicant's email (Annexure **SF2**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's; (4) Kayla's email was seized by court order after her murder (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.20 - Continued Interference Not in Corporate Interests\n6.9 The Applicant claims interference is not in corporate interests. The corporate interests were served by the Second Respondent's profitable operations (R34.9M annually). The interference came from: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Domain theft; (6) Warehouse sabotage. Each action occurred after either my debt inquiry (15 May) or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June).\n---\n### 7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 8.4-9.3: FINANCIAL DISCREPANCIES AND MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 8.4 - Discovery of Financial Discrepancies\n7.1 The Applicant claims the accountant discovered discrepancies. The accountant, Mr. Bantjies, is also: (1) Undisclosed trustee; (2) Debtor owing R18.685M; (3) Controller of financial systems; (4) Recipient of the Second Respondent's fraud report on 6 June 2025. Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025. The \"discovery\" occurred after the Second Respondent exposed fraud to the person facilitating it.\n#### AD 8.5 - Accountant's Attendance and Findings\n7.2 The Applicant states Mr. Bantjies attended for provisional tax and VAT submissions. The two years of unallocated expenses (dumped into RegimA Worldwide Distribution on 30 March 2025) occurred while: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled the accounting system using the Applicant's email; (2) Linda (Ms. Farrar's sister) was employed as bookkeeper (Annexure **SF8**); (3) Mr. Bantjies was the accountant. The question arises: why were expenses unallocated for two years if the accountant and bookkeeper were performing their duties?\n#### AD 8.7 - IT Expenses and Tax Problems\n7.3 The Applicant cites IT expenses: 2024 tax year R6,738,007.47; 2025 tax year R2,116,159.47. The Applicant claims these are \"almost entirely unexplainable.\" The context omitted from the founding affidavit is that these expenses supported 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. The IT expenses represent 19.3% of revenue (2024) and 6.1% of revenue (2025)\u2014reasonable for a global e-commerce operation. The Applicant fails to disclose the revenue context.\n#### AD 8.10 - International Expenses and Tax Implications\n7.4 The Applicant claims expenses are \"seemingly international\" and accounts have \"almost exceeded the yearly allowable quota for funds leaving South Africa.\" The Shopify platforms were funded by UK company RegimA Zone Ltd (company 10697009). UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The international expenses were legitimate costs of UK-owned e-commerce operations.\n#### AD 9.2 - Bank Message Regarding International Transfers\n7.5 The Applicant references bank messages about international transfers. The actual international payment flow is demonstrated by Shopify invoices: UK entities (RegimA Zone Ltd) funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The payment direction is UK \u2192 SA, not SA \u2192 UK as the Applicant's affidavit implies.\n#### AD 9.3 - Financial Misconduct Summary\n7.6 The Applicant summarizes alleged misconduct. The documented financial misconduct includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) without the Second Respondent's authority; (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments (Annexure **SF3**, **SF5**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments for this stock (SARS audit email, Annexure **SF4**); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023, unpaid despite Ms. Farrar's false claim to me that it was paid (Annexure **JF2**, **SF6**).\n---\n### 8. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1-10.14: APPLICATION TO DECLARE RESPONDENTS DELINQUENT\n#### AD 10.1 - Relief Sought - Delinquency or Probation\n8.1 The Applicant seeks delinquency or probation orders under Section 162. The evidence establishes grounds for the Applicant's own delinquency: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers in breach of fiduciary duty as co-director; (2) Card cancellation sabotage one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation; (3) False statements about UK payment flows; (4) Abuse of ex parte process through material non-disclosures.\n#### AD 10.3 - Delinquent Conduct of Respondents\n8.2 The Applicant alleges delinquent conduct by the Second Respondent and me. My actual conduct included: (1) Fulfilling fiduciary duty as trustee by investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025); (2) Confronting Ms. Farrar about profiting from proceeds of murder; (3) Being deceived by co-trustees into signing \"Main Trustee\" document (11 Aug 2025, Annexure **JF5**); (4) Being punished with interdict two days later (13 Aug 2025, Annexure **JF6**).\n#### AD 10.4 - Contravention of Companies Act\n8.3 The Applicant alleges Companies Act contraventions. Section 76(3)(b) requires directors to act in good faith and for a proper purpose. The Applicant's actions demonstrate bad faith: (1) Manufactured crisis (card cancellation day after cooperation); (2) Material non-disclosures in ex parte application; (3) False statements about UK operations; (4) Systematic sabotage of profitable businesses.\n#### AD 10.5.2 - Probation Relief Under Section 162\n8.4 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence reveals: Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) commissioned this affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths. Mr. Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery of the fraud the Second Respondent reported.\n#### AD 10.6 - Close Corporations Act - Fiduciary Duties\n8.5 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act fiduciary duties. The Act requires members to manage in the corporation's interest. RegimA Skin Treatments (CC) owes R1,035,000 to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023. Strategic Logistics (CC) lost R5.4M in stock that \"disappeared\"\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory. These transactions were not in the corporations' interests.\n#### AD 10.6.1 - Member's Duty to Manage in Corporation's Interest\n8.6 The Applicant cites duty to manage in corporation's interest. The R5.4M stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics represents 46% of annual sales\u201410 times the historical adjustment. Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments. This transaction was not in Strategic Logistics' interest.\n#### AD 10.6.2 - Member's Duty Not to Exceed Powers\n8.7 The Applicant cites duty not to exceed powers. The unauthorized R900,000 transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) were made without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director. The Applicant exceeded his powers by acting unilaterally.\n#### AD 10.6.3 - Member's Duty to Avoid Conflicts of Interest\n8.8 The Applicant cites duty to avoid conflicts. The evidence reveals multiple conflicts: (1) Mr. Bantjies: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant; (2) Ms. Farrar's son (Adderory) supplying stock to RegimA Skin Treatments while same stock type \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) Villa Via (trust-owned) charging 86% profit margin rent to group; (4) Regimaskin.co.za (owned by Ms. Farrar's son) competing with RegimA operations.\n#### AD 10.7 - Member Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n8.9 The Applicant invokes breach of fiduciary duty liability. The breaches are established: (1) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to the Second Respondent (co-director) by unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries (as trustee) by attacking them with interdict; (3) Mr. Bantjies breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries by dismissing audit request and facilitating fraud.\n#### AD 10.7.1.2 - Liability for Economic Benefit Derived\n8.10 The Applicant cites liability for economic benefit. The economic benefits derived include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (4) 86% profit margin on Villa Via rent; (5) Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za (Adderory).\n#### AD 10.7.1.4 - Liability for Loss Suffered by Corporation\n8.11 The Applicant cites liability for corporate loss. The losses suffered include: (1) RegimA SA: R900K unauthorized transfers, revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025, Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025; (2) RegimA Zone: Customer diversion to competing domain, card cancellation sabotage; (3) Strategic Logistics: R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (4) RegimA Worldwide: Forced to pay 2 years of unallocated expenses from all companies.\n#### AD 10.8 - Disqualification for Misconduct Under Section 47\n8.12 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act Section 47 disqualification. This section applies when a member is guilty of gross negligence or fraud. The R5.4M stock adjustment (46% of sales, 10x historical) in Strategic Logistics, with Ms. Farrar claiming Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments, and the same stock type supplied by Adderory, suggests systematic fraud.\n#### AD 10.8.1 - Declaration of Delinquency as Alternative Relief\n8.13 The Applicant seeks delinquency declaration. The evidence supports declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5): (1) Intentional harm to companies (systematic sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent conduct (card cancellation without notice); (3) Breach of trust (attacking beneficiaries as trustee); (4) Abuse of process (ex parte order based on material non-disclosures and false statements).\n#### AD 10.9 - Mandatory Disqualification Under Section 162(5)\n8.14 The Applicant invokes Section 162(5) mandatory disqualification grounds. These grounds apply to the Applicant's conduct: (1) Intentional harm to companies (R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent harm (card cancellation rendering documentation inaccessible); (3) Breach of trust (trustee attacking beneficiaries).\n#### AD 10.9.2 - Intentional or Grossly Negligent Harm\n8.15 The Applicant alleges intentional or grossly negligent harm by respondents. The intentional harm was inflicted by the Applicant and his co-conspirators: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent cooperates; (2) 7 June: Cards cancelled; (3) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days after my inquiry); (4) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days after my inquiry); (5) 8 July: Warehouse sabotaged; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action followed either my debt inquiry or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure.\n#### AD 10.9.3 - Manner of Acting - Gross Negligence or Misconduct\n8.16 The Applicant alleges gross negligence or misconduct. The gross negligence is demonstrated by: Cancelling 15 business cards without notice, rendering documentation inaccessible, then complaining about missing documentation. This demonstrates consciousness of guilt and bad faith.\n#### AD 10.9.3.1 - Gross Negligence or Wilful Misconduct\n8.17 The Applicant alleges wilful misconduct. The wilful misconduct includes: (1) Systematic revenue diversion (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (2) Data destruction (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Card sabotage (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). This six-month campaign occurred after I investigated fraud and the Second Respondent exposed fraud.\n#### AD 10.9.3.2 - Acquiescence to Fraudulent Acts\n8.18 The Applicant alleges acquiescence to fraud. The acquiescence to fraud includes: (1) Two years of unallocated expenses while Ms. Farrar controlled systems using the Applicant's email and Linda was employed as bookkeeper; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" with Mr. Bantjies allegedly instructing payments; (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate unpaid since Feb 2023; (4) Villa Via 86% profit margin rent extraction.\n#### AD 10.9.3.3 - Party to Omission with Fraudulent Purpose\n8.19 The Applicant alleges omission with fraudulent purpose. The omissions with fraudulent purpose include: (1) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's trustee status from affidavit; (2) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Applicant omitted R34.9M revenue context for IT expenses; (4) Applicant omitted UK \u2192 SA payment flow (claimed opposite); (5) Applicant omitted timeline showing card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation; (6) Applicant omitted my debt inquiry and subsequent retaliation.\n#### AD 10.10 - Probation Under Section 162(7)\n8.20 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162(7). This section applies when conduct is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) I fulfilled fiduciary duty by investigating debt, then was punished with interdict; (2) Second Respondent exposed fraud to accountant, then suffered six-month sabotage campaign; (3) Both excluded from profitable businesses we built.\n#### AD 10.10.2.3 - Oppressive or Prejudicial Exercise of Powers\n8.21 The Applicant alleges oppressive exercise of powers. The oppressive exercise of powers includes: (1) Applicant used trustee powers to attack beneficiaries; (2) Mr. Bantjies used trustee powers to dismiss audit request and facilitate fraud; (3) Applicant used director powers to make unauthorized R900K transfers; (4) Applicant used court process to obtain ex parte order based on material non-disclosures.\n#### AD 10.10.2.4 - Conduct with Oppressive or Prejudicial Result\n8.22 The Applicant alleges conduct with prejudicial result. The prejudicial results include: (1) I was excluded from companies after investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent excluded from R34.9M operations he built; (3) Customers diverted to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son; (4) R900K transferred without authorization; (5) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (6) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate unpaid.\n#### AD 10.10.22 - Business Conducted in Oppressive Manner\n8.23 The Applicant alleges oppressive business conduct. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled all systems using Applicant's email while claiming to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions; (2) Applicant had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems; (3) Two years of expenses unallocated despite employed bookkeeper; (4) Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) dismissed fraud investigation.\n#### AD 10.10.41 - Conduct Inconsistent with Duties\n8.24 The Applicant alleges conduct inconsistent with duties. The conduct inconsistent with duties includes: (1) Trustee attacking beneficiaries (Applicant, Mr. Bantjies); (2) Director making unauthorized transfers (Applicant); (3) Trustee dismissing fraud investigation (Mr. Bantjies); (4) Accountant facilitating fraud while being debtor (Mr. Bantjies); (5) Administrator controlling systems while diverting revenue (Ms. Farrar).\n#### AD 10.13 - Unaccounted Money - Significant Sums\n8.25 The Applicant alleges unaccounted money. The unaccounted money includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023; (4) R1.73 million transferred 11 Sep 2025; (5) Two years of unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide on 30 Mar 2025.\n#### AD 10.14 - Full Extent of Transgressions Not Yet Determined\n8.26 The Applicant claims full extent not yet determined. The full extent includes: (1) Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email; (4) Ms. Farrar's son's competing domain; (5) Adderory's stock supply relationship; (6) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme; (7) Court order seizing Kayla's email during law enforcement investigation.\n---\n### 9. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 11.2-12.4: UK OPERATIONS AND ALLEGED FRAUD\n#### AD 11.2 - UK Head Office - RegimA UK Ltd\n9.1 The Applicant describes UK operations. RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The UK company is the economic owner of the e-commerce operations.\n#### AD 11.3 - Directors of UK Entity\n9.2 The Applicant describes UK directors. The UK company was established by the Second Respondent and Kayla to own and operate the global e-commerce platforms. After Kayla's murder (13 July 2023), the Second Respondent continued managing the operations.\n#### AD 11.4 - Applicant's Role in Operations\n9.3 The Applicant describes his role. The evidence demonstrates the Applicant had no operational role: (1) No access to email (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (4) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's. The Applicant appears to be a figurehead.\n#### AD 11.6 - UK Branch Operations\n9.4 The Applicant describes UK branch operations. The UK company funded SA operations through Shopify subscription payments. Shopify invoices demonstrate UK \u2192 SA payment flow of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The UK company invested in SA operations, not the reverse.\n#### AD 11.8 - UK Financial Concerns\n9.5 The Applicant expresses UK financial concerns. The financial concerns were manufactured: (1) Card cancellation 7 June 2025 disrupted UK funding; (2) Domain theft 29 May 2025 diverted customers; (3) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 destroyed UK-funded operations; (4) Data expungement 22 May 2025 eliminated audit trail.\n#### AD 12.1 - UK Branch Non-Payment and Fraud Concerns\n9.6 The Applicant alleges UK branch non-payment and fraud. The Shopify invoices prove the opposite: UK entities funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). UK bank transactions corroborate the invoices (Annexure **DF8**). The Applicant's statement is demonstrably false.\n#### AD 12.2 - Misappropriation Leading to Insolvency Risk\n9.7 The Applicant alleges misappropriation leading to insolvency. The actual insolvency risk was created by: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (3) Data expungement (22 May); (4) Card cancellation (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). Despite six months of sabotage, the Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied.\n#### AD 12.3 - Purpose of Court Application\n9.8 The Applicant states the purpose is to prevent further harm. The actual purpose appears to be: (1) Punish me for investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May); (2) Punish Second Respondent for exposing Villa Via fraud (6 June); (3) Seize control of R34.9M operations Second Respondent built; (4) Prevent forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and the systematic fraud.\n#### AD 12.4 - Alternative Roles for Wife and Son\n9.9 The Applicant suggests alternative roles for the Second Respondent and me. The evidence demonstrates: (1) I fulfilled trustee duties by investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent built and managed R34.9M profitable operations; (3) Both were systematically sabotaged after investigating/exposing fraud; (4) Both were attacked with interdict by co-trustees; (5) I was included in interdict two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document.\n---\n### 10. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 13.2-13.8: REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERDICTORY RELIEF\n#### AD 13.2 - Clear Right Not to Be Prejudiced\n10.1 The Applicant claims clear right not to be prejudiced. The Applicant has no clear right: (1) He manufactured the crisis (card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (2) He made unauthorized R900K transfers; (3) He had alternative remedies as trustee with \"additional powers\"; (4) He obtained order through material non-disclosures (Mr. Bantjies's trustee status, debtor status, timeline manipulation, UK payment flow misrepresentation).\n#### AD 13.2.2 - Injury Sustained and Apprehension of Further Harm\n10.2 The Applicant claims injury and apprehension of harm. The Applicant suffered no injury he didn't inflict on himself: (1) Card cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible; (2) Unauthorized transfers depleted accounts; (3) Revenue diversions reduced cash flow; (4) Warehouse sabotage destroyed operations. The apprehension of further harm was manufactured to justify ex parte relief.\n#### AD 13.3 - Reasonable Apprehension of Irreparable Harm\n10.3 The Applicant claims reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm. The irreparable harm was inflicted by the Applicant's six-month sabotage campaign: (1) R34.9M operations destroyed (93.3% revenue collapse); (2) Customer relationships diverted to competing domain; (3) Audit data expunged (100% loss); (4) Documentation rendered inaccessible; (5) Accounts emptied. The Second Respondent and I suffered irreparable harm, not the Applicant.\n#### AD 13.4 - Interdicts Essential for Corporation Survival\n10.4 The Applicant claims interdicts essential for survival. The corporations were profitable under the Second Respondent's management (R34.9M annually). The survival threat came from the Applicant's sabotage: (1) Unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data destruction; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Excluding the Second Respondent and me threatened survival, not ensured it.\n#### AD 13.5 - Balance of Convenience Favours Granting Relief\n10.5 The Applicant claims balance of convenience favors relief. The balance overwhelmingly favors the Second Respondent and me: (1) We built and managed profitable operations; (2) We investigated and exposed fraud; (3) We were systematically sabotaged for doing so; (4) We substituted personal cards to prevent business collapse; (5) We support independent forensic audit. The Applicant obtained relief through material non-disclosures and false statements.\n#### AD 13.8 - Other Relief Sought in Part A\n10.6 The Applicant seeks additional relief. The relief was obtained ex parte based on: (1) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Omitting timeline showing card cancellation day after cooperation; (4) Falsely claiming UK owes SA (opposite is true); (5) Omitting R34.9M revenue context; (6) Omitting my debt inquiry and retaliation pattern.\n---\n### 11. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1-14.5: FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND FORENSIC AUDIT\n#### AD 14.1 - Financial Constraints on Respondents\n11.1 The Applicant seeks financial constraints on the Second Respondent and me. The financial constraints were already imposed through sabotage: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Despite six months of sabotage, the Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors.\n#### AD 14.3 - Constraint to Prevent Financial Prejudice\n11.2 The Applicant seeks constraints to prevent prejudice. The prejudice was inflicted by the Applicant: (1) RegimA SA account opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 (Feb-Mar 2025); (2) 169 customer deposits R566,598.57 proving active trade; (3) R1.73M transferred 11 Sep 2025; (4) R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage.\n#### AD 14.4 - Forensic Audit Necessity and Remuneration\n11.3 The Applicant seeks forensic audit. The Second Respondent and I support independent forensic audit by an impartial party. Such audit would reveal: (1) Mr. Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant); (2) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme (Strategic Logistics \u2192 Adderory \u2192 RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (4) Two years unallocated expenses; (5) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (6) Revenue diversion scheme; (7) Ms. Farrar's control of systems using Applicant's email.\n#### AD 14.5 - Request for Relief Under Part B\n11.4 The Applicant requests Part B relief. The relief should include: (1) Setting aside ex parte order obtained through material non-disclosures; (2) Independent forensic audit; (3) Investigation of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts; (4) Investigation of R5.4M stock \"disappearance\"; (5) Recovery of R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (6) Investigation of Ms. Farrar's control and Adderory's role; (7) Consideration of Applicant's delinquency under Section 162(5).\n---\n### 12. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1-16.12: DISCOVERY AND URGENCY\n#### AD 16.1 - Discovery of Respondents' Conduct\n12.1 The Applicant claims discovery of conduct in mid-June 2025. The actual discovery timeline: (1) 15 May: I discovered R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (2) 6 June: Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies; (3) 7 June: Applicant cancelled cards (day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (4) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed audit request. The Applicant's \"discovery\" was actually consciousness of guilt after the Second Respondent exposed fraud to Mr. Bantjies.\n#### AD 16.2 - R600,000 Transfer as Trigger for Action\n12.2 The Applicant cites R600,000 transfer (later corrected to R500,000) as trigger. The actual triggers were: (1) 15 May: I confronted Ms. Farrar about R1,035,000 debt and \"profiting from proceeds of murder\"; (2) 6 June: Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed audit request. The R500,000 transfer is a pretext.\n#### AD 16.5 - Unawareness of Urgent Application Process\n12.3 The Applicant claims unawareness of urgent process. The Applicant had access to legal advice and Mr. Bantjies as Commissioner of Oaths. The delay from mid-June to August contradicts urgency. The actual urgency appears to be preventing forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and systematic fraud.\n#### AD 16.6 - Delay Would Have Been Avoided\n12.4 The Applicant claims delay would have been avoided if he knew the process. The two-month delay (mid-June to August) contradicts urgency. The timing suggests: (1) Waiting to see if Second Respondent's audit request would proceed; (2) Coordinating with Mr. Bantjies (who dismissed audit request 10 June); (3) Preparing my punishment (included in interdict 13 Aug, two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document 11 Aug).\n#### AD 16.8 - State of Shock and Delayed Response\n12.5 The Applicant claims state of shock. The Applicant was not in shock\u2014he was executing a systematic sabotage campaign: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping; (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 7 Jun: Card cancellation; (6) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (7) 11 Sep: Account emptying. This is not shock\u2014this is systematic execution.\n#### AD 16.10 - Attorney Consultation Timeline\n12.6 The Applicant describes attorney consultation. The consultation occurred after: (1) My debt inquiry (15 May); (2) Data expungement (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June); (5) Card cancellation (7 June); (6) Mr. Bantjies's audit dismissal (10 June). The legal action was retaliation, not discovery.\n#### AD 16.12 - Need for Urgent Court Assistance\n12.7 The Applicant claims need for urgent assistance. The Applicant had alternative remedies: (1) Trustee with \"additional powers\" as Founder; (2) Could have conducted audit as trustee; (3) Could have consulted with co-trustee (me) instead of attacking me; (4) Could have consulted with co-trustee Mr. Bantjies (who was facilitating the fraud). The Applicant chose ex parte process to avoid disclosure of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and systematic sabotage.\n---\n### 13. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 17.3-17.4: EX PARTE BASIS\n#### AD 17.3 - Ex Parte Basis for Application\n13.1 The Applicant justifies ex parte application. The ex parte process was abused through material non-disclosures: (1) Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Timeline manipulation (card cancellation day after cooperation); (4) UK payment flow misrepresentation (claimed SA \u2192 UK, actually UK \u2192 SA); (5) R34.9M revenue context omission; (6) My debt inquiry and retaliation pattern; (7) Second Respondent's fraud exposure and retaliation pattern; (8) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email; (9) Adderory's competing domain; (10) R5.4M stock \"disappearance.\"\n#### AD 17.4 - Urgency Justifies Ex Parte Relief\n13.2 The Applicant claims urgency justifies ex parte relief. The urgency was manufactured: (1) Two-month delay contradicts urgency; (2) Card cancellation day after cooperation shows consciousness of guilt; (3) Systematic sabotage from Feb-Sep shows premeditation; (4) I was included two days after signing document, showing coordination; (5) Alternative remedies available as trustee. The ex parte relief was obtained to prevent the Second Respondent and me from exposing the material non-disclosures and systematic fraud.\n---\n### 14. RESPONSE TO REMAINING AD PARAGRAPHS (18.3, 20, 22, 40.9.4, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, 88)\n#### AD 18.3 - Continual Unauthorized Fund Transfers\n14.1 The Applicant alleges continual unauthorized transfers. The unauthorized transfers were made by the Applicant: R450,000 on 14 Feb 2025 + R450,000 on 15 Feb 2025 = R900,000 total from RegimA SA without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n15.1 I respectfully request that this Honourable Court:\n15.1.1 Set aside the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025 on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n15.1.2 Dismiss the Applicant's application for delinquency or probation orders against the Second Respondent and me.\n15.1.3 Grant a counter-application declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008, on the grounds of:\n- Intentional harm to companies through systematic sabotage;\n- Grossly negligent conduct in card cancellation without notice;\n- Breach of fiduciary duty to beneficiaries as trustee;\n- Abuse of court process through material non-disclosures and false statements.\n15.1.4 Order an independent forensic audit by an impartial auditor to investigate:\n- Mr. Bantjies's conflicts of interest (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant);\n- R5.4 million stock transfer pricing scheme;\n- R1,035,000 debt to Kayla Pretorius's estate;\n- Two years of unallocated expenses;\n- Unauthorized R900,000 transfers;\n- Revenue diversion scheme;\n- Ms. Farrar's control of systems and Adderory's role.\n15.1.5 Order the Applicant to pay the costs of this application on the scale as between attorney and client.\n15.1.6 Grant such further and/or alternative relief as this Honourable Court deems fit.\n---\n### 16. CONCLUSION\n16.1 The evidence presented in this affidavit demonstrates that I fulfilled my fiduciary duties as a trustee by investigating a substantial debt owed to a deceased beneficiary's estate. I confronted Ms. Farrar about this debt on 15 May 2025, stating that keeping the funds would constitute profiting from the proceeds of murder.\n16.2 Within seven days of my inquiry, Shopify data was expunged, eliminating the audit trail. Within 14 days, a competing domain was registered by Ms. Farrar's son's company, diverting customers from the Second Respondent's operations.\n16.3 On 11 August 2025, I was deceived by my co-trustees into signing a \"Main Trustee\" document that backdated the Applicant's designation to 1 July 2025. Two days later, on 13 August 2025, the Applicant and Mr. Bantjies included me in this interdict.\n16.4 The ex parte order was obtained through material non-disclosures, including Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status, his R18.685 million debt to the trust, the timeline showing card cancellation one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation, false statements about UK payment flows, and the omission of the R34.9 million revenue context.\n16.5 The Second Respondent and I support an independent forensic audit by an impartial party. Such an audit would reveal the systematic fraud, conflicts of interest, and abuse of process that underlie this application.\n16.6 I respectfully submit that the balance of convenience overwhelmingly favors setting aside the ex parte order and granting the relief sought in this affidavit.\n---\n**SIGNED at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025.**\n---\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**  \nFirst Respondent\n---\n**THUS SIGNED AND SWORN TO before me at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025, the Deponent having acknowledged that she knows and understands the contents of this Affidavit, that she has no objection to taking the prescribed oath, and that she considers the oath to be binding on her conscience.**\n---\n**COMMISSIONER OF OATHS**\n---\n## LIST OF ANNEXURES\n**JF1:** Trust deed and trustee documentation  \n**JF2:** Email correspondence re R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025)  \n**JF3:** Rynette's false statement documentation  \n**JF4:** Domain registration records (regimaskin.co.za, 29 May 2025)  \n**JF5:** \"Main Trustee\" document (signed 11 Aug 2025, backdated to 1 July 2025)  \n**JF6:** Interdict order (13 Aug 2025)  \n**JF7:** Personal card statements (substitution to prevent collapse)  \n**JF8:** Email from Gee re domain diversion (20 June 2025)\n**DF1:** Shopify operations overview (51+ stores, R34.9M revenue)  \n**DF2:** Villa Via fraud analysis (86% profit margin)  \n**DF3:** Email correspondence with Bantjies (6 June 2025)  \n**DF4:** Card cancellation records (7 June 2025)  \n**DF5-DF7:** Shopify invoices (UK \u2192 SA payment flow, R84,661+ annually)  \n**DF8:** UK bank transactions (corroborating Shopify payments)  \n**DF9:** Unauthorized transfer records (R450K + R450K = R900K, 14-15 Feb 2025)  \n**DF10:** RegimA SA account statements (opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08)  \n**DF11:** Customer deposit records (169 deposits, R566,598.57)  \n**DF12:** Revenue diversion documentation (1 Mar, 14 Apr, 11 Sep 2025)  \n**DF13:** Warehouse sabotage instruction (8 July 2025)  \n**DF14:** Expense dumping documentation (30 Mar 2025)\n**SF1:** Bantjies debt documentation (R18.685M, investment payout schedule)  \n**SF2:** Sage screenshots (Rynette using pete@regima.com, June & Aug 2025)  \n**SF3:** Strategic Logistics R5.4M stock adjustment documentation  \n**SF4:** SARS audit email (Rynette claiming Bantjies instructed payments)  \n**SF5:** Adderory company registration and stock supply documentation  \n**SF6:** Kayla Pretorius estate documentation (R1,035,000 debt)  \n**SF7:** Court order seizing Kayla's email account  \n**SF8:** Linda employment records (bookkeeper)\n---\n**END OF AFFIDAVIT**",

INTRODUCTION AND CAPACITY\n1.1 I am JACQUELINE FAUCITT, a major businesswoman with identity number 570607 0898 18 1, resident at 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview.\n1.2 The facts herein contained fall within my personal knowledge, unless otherwise stated, and are true and correct.\n1.3 I am a co-trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust and co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd.\n________________________________\n2. PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT\n2.1 I am the First Respondent in this matter.\n2.2 I have been personally involved with the subject matter and can confirm the contents are within my personal knowledge.\n2.3 Legal submissions are made on advice of my legal representatives.\n2.4 Annexures must be read as incorporated herein.\n________________________________\n\n3. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 3.1-3.13: PARTIES AND STRUCTURE\n3.1 The Applicant's identification is noted.\n3.2 I confirm my identity as stated by the Applicant.\n3.3 The Second Respondent's identity is noted.\n3.4 RegimA Skin Treatments CC is correctly identified. I note that this entity owes R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, part of Kayla Pretorius's deceased estate, since February 2023.\n3.5 RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd is correctly identified. This entity is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust.\n3.6 Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC is correctly identified. This entity is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust and extracts an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group.\n3.7 Strategic Logistics CC is correctly identified. This entity recorded a R5.4 million stock adjustment in 2024, representing 46% of its annual sales.\n3.8 FNB is correctly identified. R900,000 was transferred from RegimA SA's FNB account without my authority as co-director on 14-15 February 2025.\n3.9 ABSA Bank is correctly identified. Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution began with an ABSA bank letter dated 14 April 2025.\n3.10 CIPC is correctly identified.\n3.11 The Applicant's statement that no relief is sought from the 3rd-9th respondents is noted.\n3.12 The Applicant's convenience references are noted.\n3.13 The Applicant's identity confirmation is noted. The commissioning of the affidavit by Mr. Bantjies, an undisclosed trustee and debtor to the Applicant (R18.685M), constitutes a material non-disclosure.\n________________________________\n\n4. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTANT'S CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n4.1 The Applicant identifies Mr. Danie Bantjies as his accountant. The Applicant fails to disclose material facts:\n4.1.1 **Trustee:** Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, concealed from beneficiaries.\n4.1.2 **Debtor:** Mr. Bantjies owes the Applicant R18.685 million (Annexure SF1).\n4.1.3 **Company Controller:** Mr. Bantjies was \"running the companies\" when fraud was reported.\n4.1.4 **Obstruction:** Mr. Bantjies dismissed the audit request on 10 June 2025.\n4.2 This confluence creates an irreconcilable conflict of interest, invalidating any claim of impartial investigation.\n________________________________\n\n5. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1-6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE\n5.1 The Applicant misrepresents the operational control structure. Evidence shows Ms. Farrar controlled all bank accounts and the Sage system.\n5.2 As co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd, I confirm that R900,000 was transferred without my authority on 14-15 February 2025.\n5.3 The Applicant's description of banking arrangements omits systematic revenue diversion orchestrated by his agents.\n________________________________\n6. JURISDICTION AND LOCUS STANDI\n6.1 The Court's jurisdiction is not disputed.\n6.2 The Applicant's locus standi is noted, subject to the material non-disclosures and conflicts of interest detailed herein.\n________________________________\n\n7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7.1-7.20: DISCOVERY OF FINANCIAL IRREGULARITIES\nJR 7.1 I deny the Applicant's claim that his accountant, Mr. Danie Bantjies, attended the office in mid-June 2025 for provisional tax and VAT submissions. The Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025, exposing the fraud involving Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC's excessive profit extraction (86% margin on rent). Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, a fact concealed from the beneficiaries, and owes the Applicant R18.685 million (Annexure SF1).\nJR 7.2 The Applicant's claim that Mr. Bantjies \"noted discrepancies\" in July 2025 is a misrepresentation. The discrepancies were reported to Mr. Bantjies by the Second Respondent on 6 June 2025. The very next day, 7 June 2025, the Applicant cancelled 15 business credit cards (Annexure DF4), demonstrating consciousness of guilt and retaliation for the exposure of fraud.\nJR 7.3 The Applicant mischaracterizes legitimate IT expenses as \"irregular payments.\" These expenses relate to the 51 Shopify stores and associated software infrastructure required to generate R34.9 million in annual revenue. The true irregularities are: (1) R5.4 million stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics CC (46% of annual sales); (2) R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA; (3) Villa Via's 86% profit margin on rent.\nJR 7.4 The Applicant's characterization of the Second Respondent's conduct as \"increasingly erratic\" is unfounded and defamatory. The Second Respondent was managing a profitable global e-commerce operation generating R34.9 million annually. His conduct was professional and transparent, as evidenced by his provision of comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025.\nJR 7.5.1 The Applicant's claim that payments \"could not be explained\" is false. The Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025, including detailed financial analysis and evidence of fraud.\nJR 7.5.2 The Applicant cancelled 15 business credit cards on 7 June 2025, one day after receiving the Second Respondent's reports. This timing demonstrates a manufactured crisis and application of the doctrine of venire contra factum proprium (estoppel). The Applicant cannot complain of a situation he deliberately created.\nJR 7.5.3 The Applicant cancelled his own card \"for the sake thereof,\" suggesting awareness that the card cancellations were punitive rather than protective.\nJR 7.6 The Applicant's claim that \"the majority of the transactions remain unexplained\" is contradicted by the comprehensive reports provided on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's refusal to accept these explanations was part of the retaliation strategy.\nJR 7.7 I confirm that the Applicant's card cancellations on 7 June 2025 caused service interruptions, including the halting of internet domains and essential business subscriptions. This was the direct and foreseeable consequence of the Applicant's own actions.\nJR 7.8 The Applicant's allegation that the Second Respondent \"adopted a 'superior' position and effectively refused to assist\" is false. The Second Respondent had already provided comprehensive assistance on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's characterization is an attempt to justify his retaliatory conduct.\nJR 7.9 The inter-office communications referenced by the Applicant (Annexure PF7) demonstrate the Second Respondent's professionalism and the Applicant's unreasonable demands following the card cancellations.\nJR 7.10 The Applicant's communications were with the Second Respondent's personal assistant because the Applicant had already cancelled the business credit cards, creating a crisis that required immediate attention.\nJR 7.11 The Applicant's claim that the Second Respondent \"would or could not provide relevant invoices\" is contradicted by the comprehensive reports provided on 6 June 2025, which included detailed financial documentation.\nJR 7.12 The Applicant's allegation that the Second Respondent \"interfered with the corporations' staff doing their jobs\" is an inversion of the facts. The interference came from the Applicant and his agents, who:\n*\t\n\tCancelled 15 business credit cards (7 June 2025)\n*\t\n\tRevoked the Second Respondent's email access (retaliation for reporting fraud)\n*\t\n\tDiverted company revenue to competing entities owned by Ms. Farrar's son\n*\t\n\tExpunged Shopify audit data (22 May 2025)\nJR 7.13.1 The Applicant's claim regarding email access is misleading. The Second Respondent's access to email and accounting systems was revoked in retaliation for exposing financial misconduct on 6 June 2025.\nJR 7.13.2 The selective restoration of email access \"on an ad hoc basis\" was controlled by Ms. Farrar, who had control of the Applicant's email address (pete@regima.com <mailto:pete@regima.com> ) and all company systems (Annexures SF2, SF4).\nJR 7.14 The \"continued interference\" referenced by the Applicant was the systematic sabotage orchestrated by the Applicant's agents, including:\n*\t\n\tRevenue diversion from RegimA SA (from 1 March 2025)\n*\t\n\tRevenue diversion from RegimA Worldwide Distribution (from 14 April 2025, Annexure DF12)\n*\t\n\tCustomer diversion to regimaskin.co.za, owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure JF8)\n*\t\n\tWarehouse sabotage (July 2025, Annexure DF13)\nJR 7.15 The conduct \"not in the interests of the corporations\" was the Applicant's systematic dismantling of a profitable R34.9 million operation in retaliation for the Second Respondent's exposure of fraud.\nJR 7.16.1 I confirm that I approached the banks (FNB and ABSA) to obtain duplicate cards on or about 24 June 2025. This action was necessary to prevent the total collapse of the business operations following the Applicant's punitive card cancellations on 7 June 2025.\nJR 7.16.2 The use of personal credit cards to maintain business operations demonstrates the Applicant's bad faith and the manufactured nature of the crisis.\nJR 7.17.1 The Applicant's claim that I \"rejected any idea of malfeasance or neglect on our son's part\" is false. I defended the Second Respondent because he had acted professionally and transparently, providing comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025.\nJR 7.17.2 The Applicant's characterization of my response as \"I will show you\" is a misrepresentation designed to portray me as defiant rather than protective of legitimate business interests.\nJR 7.18.1 I deny transferring R500,000 to the Second Respondent on or about 16 July 2025 as a \"birthday gift.\" This allegation is false and unsupported by evidence.\nJR 7.18.2 The Applicant's claim that I have \"no other sources of income other than remuneration by the third to sixth respondents\" is irrelevant to the allegations and appears designed to undermine my financial independence.\nJR 7.18.3 If any transfer occurred on 16 July 2025, it would have been a legitimate business transaction, not a personal gift. The Applicant provides no evidence (bank statements, invoices, or transfer documentation) to support this allegation.\nJR 7.19 I deny that any transfer was made \"without the Applicant's knowledge.\" As the sole trustee with absolute powers over the Faucitt Family Trust (which owns RegimA Worldwide and Villa Via), and with Ms. Farrar controlling all bank accounts under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, the Applicant had full visibility of all financial transactions.\nJR 7.20 The Applicant's claim that any alleged transfer was \"separate to remuneration as director/member\" is speculative and unsupported. The Second Respondent's remuneration structure included performance-based compensation for managing the R34.9 million e-commerce operation.\n________________________________\n\n8. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 8.1-8.10: IT EXPENSES ANALYSIS\nJR 8.1 The Applicant's claims regarding IT expenses must be viewed in the context of a R34.9 million global e-commerce operation. This operation requires a sophisticated and robust IT infrastructure, which the Second Respondent built and managed.\nJR 8.2 The expense categories referenced by the Applicant are standard for a global e-commerce business. This includes 51 Shopify stores, associated software licenses, payment gateways, and marketing platforms.\nJR 8.3 The expense amounts are proportional to the revenue generated. The IT infrastructure was essential to achieving R34.9 million in annual sales.\nJR 8.4 The Applicant misrepresents the timeline of discovery. The Second Respondent discovered and reported the discrepancies to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's alleged \"discovery\" in mid-June was a pretext for retaliation.\nJR 8.5 The investigation was conducted by the conflicted Mr. Bantjies, who had a direct financial interest in concealing the fraud he was involved in. This invalidates any claim of an impartial investigation.\nJR 8.6 The IT vendors referenced are legitimate and well-known providers of e-commerce services, including Shopify, Google, and various software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms.\nJR 8.7 The Applicant's claim that IT expenses were \"unexplained\" is false. The Second Respondent provided comprehensive documentation to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025.\nJR 8.8 International payments are a standard and necessary part of a global e-commerce business with customers and suppliers in multiple countries.\nJR 8.9 The bank messages regarding foreign exchange limits are standard notifications and not evidence of misconduct. They are a routine part of international transactions.\nJR 8.10 The true financial irregularities are not the legitimate IT expenses, but the R5.4 million stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics CC, the R900,000 in unauthorized transfers, and the 86% profit extraction by Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC.\n________________________________\n\n9. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 9.1-9.4: FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT SUMMARY\nJR 9.1 The Applicant's summary of financial misconduct is an inversion of the facts, designed to deflect from the actual fraud schemes.\nJR 9.2 The bank message regarding foreign exchange limits is a standard notification, not evidence of misconduct. It is a routine part of international business.\nJR 9.3 The Applicant's summary of \"unexplained expenses\" is a mischaracterization of legitimate IT costs. The actual misconduct includes:\n**JR 9.3.1** The **R5.4 million stock adjustment** in Strategic Logistics CC, representing 46% of annual sales.\n**JR 9.3.2** The **R900,000 in unauthorized transfers** from RegimA SA's FNB account.\n**JR 9.3.3** The **86% profit margin on rent** charged by Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC.\nJR 9.4 The total financial impact of the Applicant's and his agents' misconduct is substantial and includes:\n**JR 9.4.1** The **R5.4 million** stock loss in Strategic Logistics CC.\n**JR 9.4.2** The **R900,000** in unauthorized transfers.\n**JR 9.4.3** The **R1,035,000** debt owed to Kayla Pretorius's deceased estate.\n**JR 9.4.4** The ongoing revenue diversion to competing entities.\n________________________________\n\n10. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1-10.13: DELINQUENCY ALLEGATIONS\nJR 10.1 The Applicant's request to have the Second Respondent and me declared delinquent is an abuse of process. Our actions were consistent with our fiduciary duties. It is the Applicant's own conduct that warrants a delinquency declaration under Section 162(5)(c) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008.\nJR 10.2 The Applicant has: (i) grossly abused his position as a director and trustee; (ii) intentionally or by gross negligence inflicted harm upon the companies; and (iii) acted in a manner that constitutes gross negligence, wilful misconduct, and a breach of trust.\nJR 10.3 The Applicant acted in bad faith and for an improper purpose, in contravention of Section 76(3)(b) of the Companies Act, by manufacturing a crisis to conceal the financial misconduct we had exposed.\nJR 10.4 The Applicant's reliance on the Close Corporations Act is noted. The provisions of this Act, particularly regarding gross negligence and fraud, apply to the Applicant's own conduct.\nJR 10.5 The Applicant's definition of delinquency is noted. The Applicant's conduct meets this definition.\nJR 10.6 The Applicant's definition of probation is noted. The Applicant's conduct meets this definition.\nJR 10.7 The Applicant invokes breach of fiduciary duty liability. The breaches are established: (1) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to the Second Respondent (co-director) by unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries (as trustee) by attacking them with interdict; (3) Mr. Bantjies breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries by dismissing audit request and facilitating fraud.\nJR 10.7.1.1 The Applicant cites liability for loss suffered by corporation. The losses include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) Revenue diversion to competing domain; (4) Card cancellation sabotage; (5) Data expungement.\nJR 10.7.1.2 The Applicant cites liability for economic benefit. The economic benefits derived include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (4) 86% profit margin on Villa Via rent; (5) Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za (Adderory).\nJR 10.8 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act Section 47 disqualification. This section applies when a member is guilty of gross negligence or fraud. The R5.4M stock adjustment (46% of sales, 10x historical) in Strategic Logistics, with Ms. Farrar claiming Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments, and the same stock type supplied by Adderory, suggests systematic fraud.\nJR 10.9 The Applicant invokes Section 162(5) mandatory disqualification grounds. These grounds apply to the Applicant's conduct: (1) Intentional harm to companies (R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent harm (card cancellation rendering documentation inaccessible); (3) Breach of trust (trustee attacking beneficiaries).\nJR 10.9.1 The Applicant's reliance on Section 162(5)(a) is noted. This ground applies to the Applicant.\nJR 10.9.2 The Applicant alleges intentional or grossly negligent harm by respondents. The intentional harm was inflicted by the Applicant and his co-conspirators: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent cooperates; (2) 7 June: Cards cancelled; (3) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days after my inquiry); (4) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days after my inquiry); (5) 8 July: Warehouse sabotaged; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action followed either my debt inquiry or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure.\nJR 10.9.3 The Applicant alleges gross negligence or misconduct. The gross negligence is demonstrated by: Cancelling 15 business cards without notice, rendering documentation inaccessible, then complaining about missing documentation. This demonstrates consciousness of guilt and bad faith.\nJR 10.9.3.1 The Applicant alleges wilful misconduct. The wilful misconduct includes: (1) Systematic revenue diversion (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (2) Data destruction (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Card sabotage (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). This six-month campaign occurred after I investigated fraud and the Second Respondent exposed fraud.\nJR 10.9.3.2 The Applicant alleges acquiescence to fraud. The acquiescence to fraud includes: (1) Two years of unallocated expenses while Ms. Farrar controlled systems using the Applicant's email and Linda was employed as bookkeeper; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" with Mr. Bantjies allegedly instructing payments; (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate unpaid since Feb 2023; (4) Villa Via 86% profit margin rent extraction.\nJR 10.9.3.3 The Applicant alleges omission with fraudulent purpose. The omissions with fraudulent purpose include: (1) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's trustee status from affidavit; (2) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Applicant omitted R34.9M revenue context for IT expenses; (4) Applicant omitted UK \u2192 SA payment flow (claimed opposite); (5) Applicant omitted timeline showing card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation; (6) Applicant omitted my debt inquiry and subsequent retaliation.\nJR 10.10 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162(7). This section applies when conduct is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) I fulfilled fiduciary duty by investigating debt, then was punished with interdict; (2) Second Respondent exposed fraud to accountant, then suffered six-month sabotage campaign; (3) Both excluded from profitable businesses we built.\nJR 10.10.1 The Applicant alleges conduct inconsistent with duties. The conduct inconsistent with duties includes: (1) Trustee attacking beneficiaries (Applicant, Mr. Bantjies); (2) Director making unauthorized transfers (Applicant); (3) Trustee dismissing fraud investigation (Mr. Bantjies); (4) Accountant facilitating fraud while being debtor (Mr. Bantjies); (5) Administrator controlling systems while diverting revenue (Ms. Farrar).\nJR 10.10.2 The Applicant invokes Section 162(a)(iii) grounds for probation.\nJR 10.10.2.1 The Applicant alleges conduct with prejudicial result. The prejudicial results include: (1) I was excluded from companies after investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent excluded from R34.9M operations he built; (3) Customers diverted to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son; (4) R900K transferred without authorization; (5) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (6) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate unpaid.\nJR 10.10.2.2 The Applicant alleges oppressive business conduct. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled all systems using Applicant's email while claiming to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions; (2) Applicant had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems; (3) Two years of expenses unallocated despite employed bookkeeper; (4) Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) dismissed fraud investigation.\nJR 10.10.2.3 The Applicant alleges oppressive exercise of powers. The oppressive exercise of powers includes: (1) Applicant used trustee powers to attack beneficiaries; (2) Mr. Bantjies used trustee powers to dismiss audit request and facilitate fraud; (3) Applicant used director powers to make unauthorized R900K transfers; (4) Applicant used court process to obtain ex parte order based on material non-disclosures.\nJR 10.11 The Applicant's requested remedies are inappropriate. The appropriate remedy is a full, independent forensic audit.\nJR 10.12 The Court's discretion should be exercised against the Applicant due to his abuse of process and material non-disclosures.\nJR 10.13 The Applicant alleges unaccounted money. The unaccounted money includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023; (4) R1.73 million transferred 11 Sep 2025; (5) Two years of unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide on 30 Mar 2025.\n________________________________\n\n11. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 11.1-11.9: UK OPERATIONS\nJR 11.1 The Applicant's statement that \"we also began companies in the United Kingdom\" is misleading. The UK e-commerce operations were built and funded by RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009), which is owned and operated by the Second Respondent.\nJR 11.2 The Applicant's claim that these companies \"fall under the UK head office, being RegimA UK Ltd\" is false. RegimA Zone Ltd is an independent entity, not under RegimA UK Ltd.\nJR 11.3 The Applicant's statement regarding directors is noted. The operational control and funding of RegimA Zone Ltd rests with the Second Respondent.\nJR 11.4 The Applicant's claim of \"minimal involvement\" is accurate. The Applicant had no operational involvement in the UK e-commerce operations built by the Second Respondent.\nJR 11.5 The Applicant's statement that the Second Respondent \"was appointed to oversee the UK branch\" is misleading. The Second Respondent built and owns RegimA Zone Ltd independently.\nJR 11.6 The Applicant's claim that \"the third to sixth respondents ship to the UK branch, but do not receive payment therefrom\" is a complete inversion of the facts. UK bank records show that RegimA Zone Ltd continuously paid for the South African Shopify platforms (Annexure DF8). This directly contradicts the Applicant's perjurious claims that the UK entities were indebted to the SA companies.\nJR 11.7 The Applicant's reference to Isaac Chesno and alleged fraud is irrelevant to the current matter and appears designed to create a false narrative of UK financial problems.\nJR 11.8 The Applicant's statement that he fears \"the continued non-payment (from the UK branch) may inter alia be a ruse\" is contradicted by bank records showing continuous UK \u2192 SA payments (Annexure DF8).\nJR 11.9 The Applicant's claim that he has \"no idea pertaining to the financial wellness of the UK branches\" is inconsistent with his role as trustee with absolute powers. This statement appears designed to create a pretext for further interference with the Second Respondent's UK operations.\n________________________________\n\n12. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 12.1-12.4: NECESSITY OF RELIEF\n12.1 The Applicant has failed to establish necessity for the relief sought.\n12.2 The Applicant created the crisis he now complains about through card cancellations on 7 June 2025.\n12.3 The Applicant has alternative remedies available, including his absolute powers as trustee.\n12.4 The relief sought is disproportionate and punitive rather than protective.\n________________________________\n\n13. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 13.1-13.7: INTERDICTORY RELIEF\n13.1 The Applicant has failed to establish the requirements for interdictory relief.\n13.2 The Applicant has no clear right. The alleged misconduct is contradicted by evidence.\n13.3 The Applicant has failed to establish irreparable harm. The harm was self-inflicted.\n13.4 The Applicant has alternative remedies, including his trustee powers.\n13.5 The balance of convenience favors the Respondents. The interdict would destroy a R34.9M operation.\n13.6 The Applicant's delay undermines the urgency claim.\n13.7 The relief sought under Part A is unjustified and should be refused.\n________________________________\n\n14. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1-14.5: FORENSIC AUDIT AND OTHER RELIEF\n14.1 The Applicant seeks a forensic audit. This is disingenuous given Mr. Bantjies's conflict of interest.\n14.2 Any forensic audit must be conducted by an independent auditor, not one selected by the conflicted Applicant.\n14.3 The audit must include Villa Via's 86% profit margin, the R5.4M stock adjustment, and Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt.\n14.4 The costs of any audit should be borne by the Applicant, who created this crisis.\n14.5 Other relief sought is opposed for reasons stated herein.\n________________________________\n\n15. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1-16.12: URGENCY\n15.1 The Applicant's urgency claim is contradicted by the two-month delay between alleged discovery (mid-June) and application (August).\n15.2 The Applicant created the urgency through card cancellations on 7 June 2025.\n15.3 The doctrine of venire contra factum proprium (estoppel) applies. The Applicant cannot complain of a situation he created.\n15.4 The true motivation was retaliation against the Second Respondent and me for exposing financial misconduct.\n15.5 The Applicant's claim of being in a \"state of shock\" is disingenuous, as the evidence reveals a premeditated campaign.\n________________________________\n\n16. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 17.1-17.4: EX PARTE BASIS\n16.1 The Applicant's ex parte application was improper and based on material non-disclosures.\n16.2 The Applicant failed to disclose Mr. Bantjies's triple conflict (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant).\n16.3 The Applicant failed to disclose the timeline showing retaliation (reports 6 June \u2192 cards cancelled 7 June).\n16.4 The ex parte order should be set aside due to material non-disclosures and false statements.\n________________________________\n\n17. RESPONSE TO REMAINING PARAGRAPHS\n17.1 The Applicant's remaining allegations are a continuation of the same pattern of misrepresentation and non-disclosure.\n17.2 The evidence demonstrates that the unauthorized transfers, financial irregularities, and operational sabotage were all orchestrated by the Applicant and his agents in retaliation for our attempts to expose their misconduct.\n________________________________\n\n18. PRAYER\nWHEREFORE I pray for an order in the following terms:\n1.\tThat the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025 be set aside.\n2.\tThat the Applicant's application be dismissed with costs on an attorney and client scale.\n3.\tThat the Applicant be declared a delinquent director in terms of Section 162(5) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008.\n4.\tThat an independent forensic auditor be appointed to investigate the financial affairs of the companies and the conduct of the Applicant and his agents.\n5.\tFurther and/or alternative relief.\n________________________________\nJACQUELINE FAUCITT\nFirst Respondent\nDate: November 2, 2025\n________________________________\nEND OF AFFIDAVIT",

The events between March and June (prior to the stated initiating cause of the interdict) demonstrate strong evidence of how our revenue streams were hijacked. These involve the payment diversion, audit trail disappearance, fulfilment blockade and communication interception in an almost mechanically precise series of weekly actions that ultimately resulted in payments and customer queries going elsewhere while we were left with the expenses and our ability to pay such expenses was systematically removed through card cancellations, interdicts and finally the emptying of the accounts forcing them into insolvency. There are several key pieces of evidence we are still recovering but 80% of the material supporting evidence is in place.\n\nWarm Regards\nDan & Jax\n\nFrom: Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za> \nSent: Tuesday, 30 September 2025 5:28 PM\nTo: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: Daniel J.

Faucitt <dan@regima.com <mailto:dan@regima.com> >\nSubject: Firstly - Regarding the only (false) claim made against Jacqui Faucitt \n\n# Corrected Evidence Analysis - Case 2025_137857\n*Date: September 30, 2025*\n\n## Critical Corrections to Case Narrative\n\n### 1. Jacqui Faucitt's Role\n\n**ESTABLISHED FACTS**:\n- Jacqui Faucitt does NOT handle finances and was informed by Daniel of the payment failures\n- She has NO involvement in financial operations regarding RWW creditors\n- She did NOT give R500,000 to Daniel (this is a misrepresentation)\n\n**EVIDENCE**: \n- No documentation shows Jacqui performing any unusual financial transactions\n- Daniel Faucitt transferred funds to pay creditors when FNB cards cancelled without his knowledge defaulted for 6 weeks from 7 June\n- The R500,000 was a director's loan, not a gift\n\n**CONCLUSION**: Jacqui Faucitt has done nothing wrong financially\n\n### 2. The R500,000 Director's Loan - Actual Facts\n\n**DOCUMENTED REALITY**:\n- **Who**: Daniel Faucitt (company founder and owner)\n- **What**: Director's loan from his own company\n- **Amount**: R500,000\n- **Date**: July 16, 2025\n- **Why**: To maintain company operations after FNB cards were secretly cancelled\n\n**CORRECTING THE FALSE NARRATIVE**:\n- This was NOT a \"gift\" from Jacqui\n- This was NOT unauthorized - Daniel owns the company\n- This was a LEGITIMATE director's loan\n- Directors have the legal right to take loans from their companies\n\n**EVIDENCE**:\n- Timeline shows: \"Dan draws R500,000 Director Loan from SLG\"\n- Context: \"Due to FNB card cancellations 6 weeks earlier\"\n- Purpose: \"maintain creditor payments\"\n\n### 3. The Card Cancellation Context\n\n**TIMELINE OF EVENTS**:\n1. **June 7, 2025**: FNB Company cards secretly cancelled\n2. **June 7 - July 16**: Daniel pays nearly ALL company creditors from personal account\n3. **July 16, 2025**: Director's loan taken to:\n   - Reimburse Daniel's personal expenditures\n   - Continue paying company obligations\n   - Maintain business operations\n\n**BUSINESS NECESSITY**: Without this loan, the company would have defaulted on obligations\n\n### 4. Account Control - Who Can Actually Do What\n\n**RYNETTE FARRAR**:\n- Has exclusive access to all accounts (documented)\n- Only person who can move money\n- Controls Pete@regima.com <mailto:Pete@regima.com>  email address\n\n**JACQUI FAUCITT**:\n- Does NOT do finance with ABSA\n- Has NO account access to ABSA\n- Cannot transfer funds from ABSA\n\n**PETER FAUCITT**:\n- Has NO direct account access\n- Cannot steal money he can't access\n- All his emails go through Rynette\n\n**DANIEL FAUCITT**:\n- Company founder and owner\n- Took legitimate director's loan\n- Was protecting company by paying creditors personally\n\n### 5. Debunking False Accusations\n\n**FALSE CLAIM**: \"Jacqui gave R500,000 to Daniel\"\n**TRUTH**: Daniel took a director's loan from his own company\n\n**FALSE CLAIM**: \"The R500,000 was unauthorized\"\n**TRUTH**: Directors can legally take loans from their companies\n\n**FALSE CLAIM**: \"The R500,000 was a birthday gift\"\n**TRUTH**: It was a documented director's loan for business operations\n\n### 6. Legal and Financial Reality\n\n**Director's Loans**:\n- Legal and common business practice\n- Require proper documentation (which exists)\n- Often used for cash flow management\n- Especially necessary in emergency situations\n\n**The Emergency**:\n- FNB Cards cancelled secretly (June 7)\n- Business operations at risk\n- Creditors needed payment\n- Director stepped in with personal funds\n\n### 7. Summary of Who Did What\n\n**DANIEL FAUCITT**:\n\u2713 Took legitimate director's loan\n\u2713 Saved company from defaulting\n\u2713 Used personal funds for 6 weeks\n\u2713 Acted as responsible company owner\n\n**JACQUI FAUCITT**:\n\u2713 Not involved in finances\n\u2713 Did not give anyone money\n\u2713 Has no financial wrongdoing\n\n**RYNETTE FARRAR**:\n\u2713 Controls all ABSA accounts\n\u2713 Only person who can move money\n\u2713 Has exclusive system access\n\n**PETER FAUCITT**:\n\u2713 Has no account access\n\u2713 Cannot have stolen funds\n\u2713 Depends on Rynette for information\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe narrative that Jacqui gave Daniel R500,000 is completely false. The facts show:\n\n1. Daniel took a legitimate director's loan from his own company\n2. This was necessary due to secret card cancellations on FNB\n3. Jacqui doesn't do finance and wasn't involved\n4. Only Rynette Farrar has the ability to move money in ABSA\n5. Peter couldn't have stolen anything without account access\n\nAll accusations against Jacqui regarding this R500,000 are baseless and contradicted by documented evidence.\n\n---\n*This analysis is based solely on documented evidence and corrects misrepresentations in the case narrative.*",

fraud\n4.The Ex Parte Deception: Material non-disclosures and false statements\n5.The Manufactured Crisis: Peter created the problems he complains about\n6.The Truth: UK funded SA (not vice versa), IT expenses reasonable for R34.9M operations\nThe narrative allows connections to become self-evident through gradual revelation, maintaining professional tone while building an irrefutable case through

manufactured crisis\n- Section 76(3)(b) of Companies Act - bad faith and improper purpose\n- Section 162(5) of Companies Act - grounds for Peter's delinquency\n- Section 9(1) of Trust Property Control Act - trustee duties\n- Requirements for interdictory relief (clear right, harm, balance of convenience)\n### Strategic Recommendations\n- Emphasize manufactured crisis argument\n- Highlight retaliation pattern\n- Leverage Shopify invoice evidence for perjury\n- Support independent forensic audit\n- Pursue counter-application for Peter's delinquency\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nSent: Saturday, 01 November 2025 14:30\nTo: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.com>; Daniel Faucitt <d@rzo.io>; regizone <regizone@proton.me>\nSubject: AD NOTES - JACQUELINE FAUCITT \n## ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT: JACQUELINE FAUCITT\n**IN THE HIGH COURT OF SOUTH AFRICA**  \n**GAUTENG DIVISION, PRETORIA**\n**Case No:** 2025-137857\n**In the matter between:**\n**PETER ANDREW FAUCITT** \u2014 Applicant\nand\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT** \u2014 First Respondent  \n**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT** \u2014 Second Respondent  \n*(and others)*\n---\n## I, THE UNDERSIGNED\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**\ndo hereby make oath and state that:\n---\n### 1. INTRODUCTION AND CAPACITY\n1.1 I am the First Respondent in this matter, an adult female, and a South African citizen residing at 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview.\n1.2 I am a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust (IT 3651/2013) and a Beneficiary of the same trust. I am also a co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (2017/087935/07) and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (2011/005722/07), both of which are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust.\n1.3 The facts deposed to in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and belief, save where the context indicates otherwise, and are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\n1.4 Where I make legal submissions, I do so on the advice of my legal representatives.\n---\n### 2. PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT\n2.1 This affidavit is filed in response to the Applicant's founding affidavit and the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025.\n2.2 I oppose the relief sought by the Applicant and seek to have the ex parte order set aside on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n2.3 I address each of the Applicant's allegations in the order they appear in the founding affidavit, following the AD paragraph sequence.\n---\n### 3. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 1-3.13: PARTIES AND STRUCTURE\n#### AD 1 - Director Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n3.1 The Applicant invokes provisions relating to director liability for breach of fiduciary duty. I note that the accounting system used to track the alleged breaches was controlled by Rynette Farrar using the Applicant's email address (pete@regima.com), as evidenced by Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 (Annexure **SF2**). The Applicant himself had no access to this system.\n#### AD 1.3 - Applicant's Personal Details and Declaration\n3.2 The Applicant's personal details are noted. I observe that this affidavit was commissioned by Danie Jacobus Bantjies, identified as \"our accountant.\" The full extent of Mr. Bantjies's roles will become apparent through the evidence presented herein.\n#### AD 2 - Company Business Conduct Requirements\n3.3 The Applicant alleges reckless or grossly negligent business conduct. The financial performance of the companies demonstrates the contrary. The Second Respondent and his late partner, Kayla Pretorius, built 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. RegimA SA operates 25 stores with R8.5 million turnover, while RegimA Zone operates 26 stores with R26.4 million turnover. The businesses were highly profitable under the Second Respondent's management.\n#### AD 2.4 - Parties to the Application - Introduction\n3.4 The Applicant introduces the parties. The corporate structure reveals that certain entities are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust, which has three trustees. Two are identified in the founding affidavit: the Applicant and myself. The third trustee's identity was not disclosed to the beneficiaries until recently.\n#### AD 3 - Court Order for Probation of Directors/Members\n3.5 The Applicant seeks probation orders under Section 162 of the Companies Act. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence will demonstrate that the accountant who allegedly \"discovered\" the irregularities has multiple undisclosed roles that create impermissible conflicts.\n#### AD 3.2 - Respondents - Wife\n3.6 I am correctly identified as the Applicant's wife and First Respondent. On 15 May 2025, I confronted Rynette Farrar regarding a debt of R1,035,000 owed by RegimA Skin Treatments CC to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd since February 2023 (Annexure **JF2**). These funds were part of Kayla Pretorius's estate. I informed Ms. Farrar that keeping these funds would constitute profiting from the proceeds of murder. This confrontation proved significant in the events that followed.\n#### AD 3.4 - Respondents - Son\n3.7 The Second Respondent is correctly identified as the Applicant's son. On 6 June 2025, the Second Respondent cooperated with the Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports to the accountant regarding Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC, which is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust (Annexure **DF3**). The Second Respondent unknowingly reported fraud to one of the perpetrators.\n#### AD 3.4.2 - Third Respondent - RegimA Skin Treatments\n3.8 RegimA Skin Treatments CC (B1992/005371/23) owes R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, part of Kayla Pretorius's estate, since February 2023. When I raised this debt on 15 May 2025, Ms. Farrar claimed it was paid\u2014a statement I have since determined to be false. RegimA Skin Treatments receives stock from Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure **SF5**).\n#### AD 3.6 - Fourth Respondent - Regim A UK\n3.9 RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). This contradicts claims made later in the founding affidavit regarding UK entities owing money to SA operations.\n#### AD 3.6.1 - Fifth Respondent - Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC\n3.10 Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC (1996/004451/23) is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. Financial analysis reveals an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group\u2014an excessive profit extraction (Annexure **DF2**). This was the fraud the Second Respondent reported to the accountant on 6 June 2025.\n#### AD 3.6.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Villa Via Arcadia\n3.11 Property registration confirms trust ownership. The trust has three trustees, but only two were known to the beneficiaries at the time of this application.\n#### AD 3.7 - Sixth Respondent - Strategic Logistics CC\n3.12 Strategic Logistics CC (2008/136496/23) experienced a R5.4 million stock adjustment in 2024\u2014stock that allegedly \"just disappeared\" (Annexure **SF3**). This represents 46% of annual sales (R5.4M on R11.3M sales) and is 10 times the prior year's adjustment. The stock type matches inventory supplied by Adderory (Pty) Ltd to RegimA Skin Treatments.\n#### AD 3.7.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Strategic Logistics\n3.13 Property registration documents are noted. In a SARS audit email concerning the R5.4M stock adjustment, Ms. Farrar claimed that Danie Bantjies instructed her to make the substantial payments related to this transaction (Annexure **SF4**).\n#### AD 3.8 - Seventh Respondent - FirstRand Bank (FNB)\n3.14 FNB holds accounts for the companies. On 14 and 15 February 2025, unauthorized transfers of R450,000 each (R900,000 total) were made from RegimA SA's FNB account without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director (Annexure **DF9**). The account opened with R997,597.94 and closed at R5,284.08 within one month, despite 169 customer deposits totaling R566,598.57 proving active trade (Annexure **DF10**, **DF11**).\n#### AD 3.9 - Eighth and Ninth Respondents\n3.15 ABSA Bank and CIPC are cited. Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution began with an ABSA bank letter dated 14 April 2025 (Annexure **DF12**).\n#### AD 3.11 - Reference to Respondents as Wife and Son\n3.16 The Applicant refers to the Second Respondent and me as \"my wife\" and \"my son.\" Both of us are beneficiaries of the Faucitt Family Trust. I am also a co-trustee. The Trust Property Control Act, 57 of 1988, Section 9(1) requires trustees to act with care, diligence, and skill in the interests of beneficiaries.\n#### AD 3.13 - Court Jurisdiction and Identity Confirmation\n3.17 Jurisdiction is confirmed. The affidavit was commissioned by Danie Bantjies, who signed as \"Commissioner of Oaths.\" Mr. Bantjies's accounting firm is \"Bantjes and Company.\" His full relationship to the trust and companies will be revealed through the evidence presented herein.\n---\n### 4. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTANT DETAILS - BANTJIES CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n#### AD 4 - Accountant Details - Bantjes and Company\n4.1 The Applicant identifies \"our accountant\" as Danie Jacobus Bantjies of \"Bantjes and Company,\" who attended the office in mid-June 2025. What the Applicant does not disclose are the following material facts:\n4.1.1 Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust\u2014a status that was unknown to the beneficiaries, the Second Respondent and myself, until recently.\n4.1.2 Mr. Bantjies is a debtor to the trust, owing R18.685 million on an investment payout schedule with payments due in May 2026, May 2027, and May 2029 (Annexure **SF1**).\n4.1.3 Mr. Bantjies controls the financial systems and gave instructions to Ms. Farrar for multi-million rand transactions, as evidenced by emails (Annexure **SF4**).\n4.1.4 Mr. Bantjies was \"running the companies\" when the Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud on 6 June 2025.\n4.1.5 Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was \"going on holiday.\"\n4.2 This creates an impermissible conflict of interest: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant + Company Controller. Mr. Bantjies had a direct financial interest in preventing discovery of the fraud the Second Respondent reported.\n---\n### 5. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1-6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE\n#### AD 6.1 - Relationships Between Parties\n5.1 The Applicant describes family and corporate relationships. The evidence demonstrates a different control structure. Ms. Farrar controlled all bank accounts (the Applicant had no access), controlled the Sage accounting system using the Applicant's email (pete@regima.com), and claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions rather than the Applicant's (Annexure **SF2**). Ms. Farrar's sister, Linda, was employed as bookkeeper, yet two years of expenses remained unallocated until 30 March 2025 (Annexure **SF8**).\n#### AD 6.3 - Directors and Members of Respondent Entities\n5.2 The Applicant describes directorships. The Second Respondent and I are co-directors of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd. RegimA Worldwide Distribution is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. On 30 March 2025, Ms. Farrar and the Applicant dumped two years of unallocated expenses into RegimA Worldwide Distribution and demanded the Second Respondent sign off within 12 hours for SARS VAT and Annual Accounts (Annexure **DF14**). The Second Respondent used this deadline extension (until 6 June) to finalize reports and uncover the Villa Via fraud.\n#### AD 6.5 - Banking and Registration of Respondent Entities\n5.3 The Applicant describes banking arrangements. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to any bank accounts; (2) Ms. Farrar controlled all accounts; (3) Revenue diversion for RegimA SA started 1 March 2025; (4) Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution started 14 April 2025 (ABSA bank letter); (5) On 11 September 2025, R1.73 million was transferred from accounts (Annexure **DF12**).\n---\n### 6. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7-7.20: URGENCY AND ALLEGED MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 7 - Urgency and Delay Considerations\n6.1 The Applicant claims urgency. The timeline reveals: (1) Alleged discovery mid-June 2025; (2) Application filed August 2025; (3) Two-month delay contradicts urgency. The actual urgency relates to the Second Respondent's fraud exposure on 6 June and my debt inquiry on 15 May.\n#### AD 7.3 - Urgency Details\n6.2 The Applicant claims the accountant noted \"numerous discrepancies\" and \"irregular payments\" in mid-June 2025. Timeline analysis reveals: 6 June 2025 (Second Respondent provides comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies), 7 June 2025 (Applicant cancels 15 UK business cards without notice). The card cancellation occurred one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation, not \"following\" any discovery. This demonstrates that the Applicant created the problem he now complains about.\n#### AD 7.6 - Financial Impact of Misconduct\n6.3 The Applicant alleges financial impact. The actual financial sabotage included: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) Revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025; (3) Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025 (100% audit data loss, seven days after my confrontation with Ms. Farrar); (4) Card cancellation 7 June 2025; (5) Domain theft 29 May 2025 (regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory, 14 days after my confrontation, Annexure **JF4**); (6) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 (R34.9M operations destroyed).\n#### AD 7.8 - Continuing Harm to Corporations\n6.4 The Applicant claims continuing harm. The harm was systematically inflicted. An email from Gee dated 20 June 2025 states she was instructed to send a \"don't use regima.zone only use regimaskin.co.za\" email (Annexure **JF8**). The domain regimaskin.co.za is owned by Adderory (Pty) Ltd (Ms. Farrar's son's company), not by RegimA. This diverted customers from the Second Respondent's platforms to a competing domain controlled by Ms. Farrar's family.\n#### AD 7.10 - Card Cancellations and Service Interruptions\n6.5 The Applicant claims he cancelled cards in June 2025 \"following\" the accountant's discovery and requested invoices from the Second Respondent. Timeline evidence demonstrates: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent provides comprehensive reports; (2) 7 June: Applicant cancels UK cards (5191, 5225) paying for Shopify subscriptions (Annexure **DF4**); (3) Cards cancelled one day after cooperation, not after any discovery. The cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible (card-based authentication), then the Applicant complained about missing documentation.\n#### AD 7.13 - Domain and Service Halts Due to Card Cancellations\n6.6 The Applicant claims subscriptions were halted due to card cancellations. To prevent business collapse, the Second Respondent substituted his personal card (1927) for RegimA SA and I substituted my personal card (3212) for RegimA Zone (Annexure **JF7**). Meanwhile, the competing domain regimaskin.co.za was actively diverting customers.\n#### AD 7.16 - Son's Interference with Business Operations\n6.7 The Applicant alleges the Second Respondent interfered with operations. The evidence demonstrates the Second Respondent built and managed 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually (Annexure **DF1**). The Second Respondent's partner, Kayla Pretorius, co-built these operations before her murder on 13 July 2023. After Kayla's death, a court order was obtained to seize her email account (kayp@rzo.io), which interfered with a law enforcement investigation that had instructed a freeze on the account (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.18 - Email and Account Access Interference\n6.8 The Applicant claims the Second Respondent restricted email access. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to his own email (pete@regima.com)\u2014controlled by Ms. Farrar; (2) Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 show Ms. Farrar using the Applicant's email (Annexure **SF2**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's; (4) Kayla's email was seized by court order after her murder (Annexure **SF7**).\n#### AD 7.20 - Continued Interference Not in Corporate Interests\n6.9 The Applicant claims interference is not in corporate interests. The corporate interests were served by the Second Respondent's profitable operations (R34.9M annually). The interference came from: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Domain theft; (6) Warehouse sabotage. Each action occurred after either my debt inquiry (15 May) or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June).\n---\n### 7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 8.4-9.3: FINANCIAL DISCREPANCIES AND MISCONDUCT\n#### AD 8.4 - Discovery of Financial Discrepancies\n7.1 The Applicant claims the accountant discovered discrepancies. The accountant, Mr. Bantjies, is also: (1) Undisclosed trustee; (2) Debtor owing R18.685M; (3) Controller of financial systems; (4) Recipient of the Second Respondent's fraud report on 6 June 2025. Mr. Bantjies dismissed the Second Respondent's audit request on 10 June 2025. The \"discovery\" occurred after the Second Respondent exposed fraud to the person facilitating it.\n#### AD 8.5 - Accountant's Attendance and Findings\n7.2 The Applicant states Mr. Bantjies attended for provisional tax and VAT submissions. The two years of unallocated expenses (dumped into RegimA Worldwide Distribution on 30 March 2025) occurred while: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled the accounting system using the Applicant's email; (2) Linda (Ms. Farrar's sister) was employed as bookkeeper (Annexure **SF8**); (3) Mr. Bantjies was the accountant. The question arises: why were expenses unallocated for two years if the accountant and bookkeeper were performing their duties?\n#### AD 8.7 - IT Expenses and Tax Problems\n7.3 The Applicant cites IT expenses: 2024 tax year R6,738,007.47; 2025 tax year R2,116,159.47. The Applicant claims these are \"almost entirely unexplainable.\" The context omitted from the founding affidavit is that these expenses supported 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually. The IT expenses represent 19.3% of revenue (2024) and 6.1% of revenue (2025)\u2014reasonable for a global e-commerce operation. The Applicant fails to disclose the revenue context.\n#### AD 8.10 - International Expenses and Tax Implications\n7.4 The Applicant claims expenses are \"seemingly international\" and accounts have \"almost exceeded the yearly allowable quota for funds leaving South Africa.\" The Shopify platforms were funded by UK company RegimA Zone Ltd (company 10697009). UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The international expenses were legitimate costs of UK-owned e-commerce operations.\n#### AD 9.2 - Bank Message Regarding International Transfers\n7.5 The Applicant references bank messages about international transfers. The actual international payment flow is demonstrated by Shopify invoices: UK entities (RegimA Zone Ltd) funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The payment direction is UK \u2192 SA, not SA \u2192 UK as the Applicant's affidavit implies.\n#### AD 9.3 - Financial Misconduct Summary\n7.6 The Applicant summarizes alleged misconduct. The documented financial misconduct includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) without the Second Respondent's authority; (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments (Annexure **SF3**, **SF5**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments for this stock (SARS audit email, Annexure **SF4**); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023, unpaid despite Ms. Farrar's false claim to me that it was paid (Annexure **JF2**, **SF6**).\n---\n### 8. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1-10.14: APPLICATION TO DECLARE RESPONDENTS DELINQUENT\n#### AD 10.1 - Relief Sought - Delinquency or Probation\n8.1 The Applicant seeks delinquency or probation orders under Section 162. The evidence establishes grounds for the Applicant's own delinquency: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers in breach of fiduciary duty as co-director; (2) Card cancellation sabotage one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation; (3) False statements about UK payment flows; (4) Abuse of ex parte process through material non-disclosures.\n#### AD 10.3 - Delinquent Conduct of Respondents\n8.2 The Applicant alleges delinquent conduct by the Second Respondent and me. My actual conduct included: (1) Fulfilling fiduciary duty as trustee by investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025); (2) Confronting Ms. Farrar about profiting from proceeds of murder; (3) Being deceived by co-trustees into signing \"Main Trustee\" document (11 Aug 2025, Annexure **JF5**); (4) Being punished with interdict two days later (13 Aug 2025, Annexure **JF6**).\n#### AD 10.4 - Contravention of Companies Act\n8.3 The Applicant alleges Companies Act contraventions. Section 76(3)(b) requires directors to act in good faith and for a proper purpose. The Applicant's actions demonstrate bad faith: (1) Manufactured crisis (card cancellation day after cooperation); (2) Material non-disclosures in ex parte application; (3) False statements about UK operations; (4) Systematic sabotage of profitable businesses.\n#### AD 10.5.2 - Probation Relief Under Section 162\n8.4 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence reveals: Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) commissioned this affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths. Mr. Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery of the fraud the Second Respondent reported.\n#### AD 10.6 - Close Corporations Act - Fiduciary Duties\n8.5 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act fiduciary duties. The Act requires members to manage in the corporation's interest. RegimA Skin Treatments (CC) owes R1,035,000 to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023. Strategic Logistics (CC) lost R5.4M in stock that \"disappeared\"\u2014same stock type supplied by Adderory. These transactions were not in the corporations' interests.\n#### AD 10.6.1 - Member's Duty to Manage in Corporation's Interest\n8.6 The Applicant cites duty to manage in corporation's interest. The R5.4M stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics represents 46% of annual sales\u201410 times the historical adjustment. Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments. This transaction was not in Strategic Logistics' interest.\n#### AD 10.6.2 - Member's Duty Not to Exceed Powers\n8.7 The Applicant cites duty not to exceed powers. The unauthorized R900,000 transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) were made without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director. The Applicant exceeded his powers by acting unilaterally.\n#### AD 10.6.3 - Member's Duty to Avoid Conflicts of Interest\n8.8 The Applicant cites duty to avoid conflicts. The evidence reveals multiple conflicts: (1) Mr. Bantjies: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant; (2) Ms. Farrar's son (Adderory) supplying stock to RegimA Skin Treatments while same stock type \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) Villa Via (trust-owned) charging 86% profit margin rent to group; (4) Regimaskin.co.za (owned by Ms. Farrar's son) competing with RegimA operations.\n#### AD 10.7 - Member Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n8.9 The Applicant invokes breach of fiduciary duty liability. The breaches are established: (1) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to the Second Respondent (co-director) by unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries (as trustee) by attacking them with interdict; (3) Mr. Bantjies breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries by dismissing audit request and facilitating fraud.\n#### AD 10.7.1.2 - Liability for Economic Benefit Derived\n8.10 The Applicant cites liability for economic benefit. The economic benefits derived include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (4) 86% profit margin on Villa Via rent; (5) Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za (Adderory).\n#### AD 10.7.1.4 - Liability for Loss Suffered by Corporation\n8.11 The Applicant cites liability for corporate loss. The losses suffered include: (1) RegimA SA: R900K unauthorized transfers, revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025, Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025; (2) RegimA Zone: Customer diversion to competing domain, card cancellation sabotage; (3) Strategic Logistics: R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (4) RegimA Worldwide: Forced to pay 2 years of unallocated expenses from all companies.\n#### AD 10.8 - Disqualification for Misconduct Under Section 47\n8.12 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act Section 47 disqualification. This section applies when a member is guilty of gross negligence or fraud. The R5.4M stock adjustment (46% of sales, 10x historical) in Strategic Logistics, with Ms. Farrar claiming Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments, and the same stock type supplied by Adderory, suggests systematic fraud.\n#### AD 10.8.1 - Declaration of Delinquency as Alternative Relief\n8.13 The Applicant seeks delinquency declaration. The evidence supports declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5): (1) Intentional harm to companies (systematic sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent conduct (card cancellation without notice); (3) Breach of trust (attacking beneficiaries as trustee); (4) Abuse of process (ex parte order based on material non-disclosures and false statements).\n#### AD 10.9 - Mandatory Disqualification Under Section 162(5)\n8.14 The Applicant invokes Section 162(5) mandatory disqualification grounds. These grounds apply to the Applicant's conduct: (1) Intentional harm to companies (R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent harm (card cancellation rendering documentation inaccessible); (3) Breach of trust (trustee attacking beneficiaries).\n#### AD 10.9.2 - Intentional or Grossly Negligent Harm\n8.15 The Applicant alleges intentional or grossly negligent harm by respondents. The intentional harm was inflicted by the Applicant and his co-conspirators: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent cooperates; (2) 7 June: Cards cancelled; (3) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days after my inquiry); (4) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days after my inquiry); (5) 8 July: Warehouse sabotaged; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action followed either my debt inquiry or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure.\n#### AD 10.9.3 - Manner of Acting - Gross Negligence or Misconduct\n8.16 The Applicant alleges gross negligence or misconduct. The gross negligence is demonstrated by: Cancelling 15 business cards without notice, rendering documentation inaccessible, then complaining about missing documentation. This demonstrates consciousness of guilt and bad faith.\n#### AD 10.9.3.1 - Gross Negligence or Wilful Misconduct\n8.17 The Applicant alleges wilful misconduct. The wilful misconduct includes: (1) Systematic revenue diversion (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (2) Data destruction (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Card sabotage (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). This six-month campaign occurred after I investigated fraud and the Second Respondent exposed fraud.\n#### AD 10.9.3.2 - Acquiescence to Fraudulent Acts\n8.18 The Applicant alleges acquiescence to fraud. The acquiescence to fraud includes: (1) Two years of unallocated expenses while Ms. Farrar controlled systems using the Applicant's email and Linda was employed as bookkeeper; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" with Mr. Bantjies allegedly instructing payments; (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate unpaid since Feb 2023; (4) Villa Via 86% profit margin rent extraction.\n#### AD 10.9.3.3 - Party to Omission with Fraudulent Purpose\n8.19 The Applicant alleges omission with fraudulent purpose. The omissions with fraudulent purpose include: (1) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's trustee status from affidavit; (2) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Applicant omitted R34.9M revenue context for IT expenses; (4) Applicant omitted UK \u2192 SA payment flow (claimed opposite); (5) Applicant omitted timeline showing card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation; (6) Applicant omitted my debt inquiry and subsequent retaliation.\n#### AD 10.10 - Probation Under Section 162(7)\n8.20 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162(7). This section applies when conduct is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) I fulfilled fiduciary duty by investigating debt, then was punished with interdict; (2) Second Respondent exposed fraud to accountant, then suffered six-month sabotage campaign; (3) Both excluded from profitable businesses we built.\n#### AD 10.10.2.3 - Oppressive or Prejudicial Exercise of Powers\n8.21 The Applicant alleges oppressive exercise of powers. The oppressive exercise of powers includes: (1) Applicant used trustee powers to attack beneficiaries; (2) Mr. Bantjies used trustee powers to dismiss audit request and facilitate fraud; (3) Applicant used director powers to make unauthorized R900K transfers; (4) Applicant used court process to obtain ex parte order based on material non-disclosures.\n#### AD 10.10.2.4 - Conduct with Oppressive or Prejudicial Result\n8.22 The Applicant alleges conduct with prejudicial result. The prejudicial results include: (1) I was excluded from companies after investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent excluded from R34.9M operations he built; (3) Customers diverted to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son; (4) R900K transferred without authorization; (5) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (6) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate unpaid.\n#### AD 10.10.22 - Business Conducted in Oppressive Manner\n8.23 The Applicant alleges oppressive business conduct. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled all systems using Applicant's email while claiming to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions; (2) Applicant had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems; (3) Two years of expenses unallocated despite employed bookkeeper; (4) Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) dismissed fraud investigation.\n#### AD 10.10.41 - Conduct Inconsistent with Duties\n8.24 The Applicant alleges conduct inconsistent with duties. The conduct inconsistent with duties includes: (1) Trustee attacking beneficiaries (Applicant, Mr. Bantjies); (2) Director making unauthorized transfers (Applicant); (3) Trustee dismissing fraud investigation (Mr. Bantjies); (4) Accountant facilitating fraud while being debtor (Mr. Bantjies); (5) Administrator controlling systems while diverting revenue (Ms. Farrar).\n#### AD 10.13 - Unaccounted Money - Significant Sums\n8.25 The Applicant alleges unaccounted money. The unaccounted money includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023; (4) R1.73 million transferred 11 Sep 2025; (5) Two years of unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide on 30 Mar 2025.\n#### AD 10.14 - Full Extent of Transgressions Not Yet Determined\n8.26 The Applicant claims full extent not yet determined. The full extent includes: (1) Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email; (4) Ms. Farrar's son's competing domain; (5) Adderory's stock supply relationship; (6) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme; (7) Court order seizing Kayla's email during law enforcement investigation.\n---\n### 9. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 11.2-12.4: UK OPERATIONS AND ALLEGED FRAUD\n#### AD 11.2 - UK Head Office - RegimA UK Ltd\n9.1 The Applicant describes UK operations. RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The UK company is the economic owner of the e-commerce operations.\n#### AD 11.3 - Directors of UK Entity\n9.2 The Applicant describes UK directors. The UK company was established by the Second Respondent and Kayla to own and operate the global e-commerce platforms. After Kayla's murder (13 July 2023), the Second Respondent continued managing the operations.\n#### AD 11.4 - Applicant's Role in Operations\n9.3 The Applicant describes his role. The evidence demonstrates the Applicant had no operational role: (1) No access to email (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (4) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's. The Applicant appears to be a figurehead.\n#### AD 11.6 - UK Branch Operations\n9.4 The Applicant describes UK branch operations. The UK company funded SA operations through Shopify subscription payments. Shopify invoices demonstrate UK \u2192 SA payment flow of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The UK company invested in SA operations, not the reverse.\n#### AD 11.8 - UK Financial Concerns\n9.5 The Applicant expresses UK financial concerns. The financial concerns were manufactured: (1) Card cancellation 7 June 2025 disrupted UK funding; (2) Domain theft 29 May 2025 diverted customers; (3) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 destroyed UK-funded operations; (4) Data expungement 22 May 2025 eliminated audit trail.\n#### AD 12.1 - UK Branch Non-Payment and Fraud Concerns\n9.6 The Applicant alleges UK branch non-payment and fraud. The Shopify invoices prove the opposite: UK entities funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). UK bank transactions corroborate the invoices (Annexure **DF8**). The Applicant's statement is demonstrably false.\n#### AD 12.2 - Misappropriation Leading to Insolvency Risk\n9.7 The Applicant alleges misappropriation leading to insolvency. The actual insolvency risk was created by: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (3) Data expungement (22 May); (4) Card cancellation (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). Despite six months of sabotage, the Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied.\n#### AD 12.3 - Purpose of Court Application\n9.8 The Applicant states the purpose is to prevent further harm. The actual purpose appears to be: (1) Punish me for investigating R1,035,000 debt (15 May); (2) Punish Second Respondent for exposing Villa Via fraud (6 June); (3) Seize control of R34.9M operations Second Respondent built; (4) Prevent forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and the systematic fraud.\n#### AD 12.4 - Alternative Roles for Wife and Son\n9.9 The Applicant suggests alternative roles for the Second Respondent and me. The evidence demonstrates: (1) I fulfilled trustee duties by investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent built and managed R34.9M profitable operations; (3) Both were systematically sabotaged after investigating/exposing fraud; (4) Both were attacked with interdict by co-trustees; (5) I was included in interdict two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document.\n---\n### 10. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 13.2-13.8: REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERDICTORY RELIEF\n#### AD 13.2 - Clear Right Not to Be Prejudiced\n10.1 The Applicant claims clear right not to be prejudiced. The Applicant has no clear right: (1) He manufactured the crisis (card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (2) He made unauthorized R900K transfers; (3) He had alternative remedies as trustee with \"additional powers\"; (4) He obtained order through material non-disclosures (Mr. Bantjies's trustee status, debtor status, timeline manipulation, UK payment flow misrepresentation).\n#### AD 13.2.2 - Injury Sustained and Apprehension of Further Harm\n10.2 The Applicant claims injury and apprehension of harm. The Applicant suffered no injury he didn't inflict on himself: (1) Card cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible; (2) Unauthorized transfers depleted accounts; (3) Revenue diversions reduced cash flow; (4) Warehouse sabotage destroyed operations. The apprehension of further harm was manufactured to justify ex parte relief.\n#### AD 13.3 - Reasonable Apprehension of Irreparable Harm\n10.3 The Applicant claims reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm. The irreparable harm was inflicted by the Applicant's six-month sabotage campaign: (1) R34.9M operations destroyed (93.3% revenue collapse); (2) Customer relationships diverted to competing domain; (3) Audit data expunged (100% loss); (4) Documentation rendered inaccessible; (5) Accounts emptied. The Second Respondent and I suffered irreparable harm, not the Applicant.\n#### AD 13.4 - Interdicts Essential for Corporation Survival\n10.4 The Applicant claims interdicts essential for survival. The corporations were profitable under the Second Respondent's management (R34.9M annually). The survival threat came from the Applicant's sabotage: (1) Unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data destruction; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Excluding the Second Respondent and me threatened survival, not ensured it.\n#### AD 13.5 - Balance of Convenience Favours Granting Relief\n10.5 The Applicant claims balance of convenience favors relief. The balance overwhelmingly favors the Second Respondent and me: (1) We built and managed profitable operations; (2) We investigated and exposed fraud; (3) We were systematically sabotaged for doing so; (4) We substituted personal cards to prevent business collapse; (5) We support independent forensic audit. The Applicant obtained relief through material non-disclosures and false statements.\n#### AD 13.8 - Other Relief Sought in Part A\n10.6 The Applicant seeks additional relief. The relief was obtained ex parte based on: (1) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Omitting timeline showing card cancellation day after cooperation; (4) Falsely claiming UK owes SA (opposite is true); (5) Omitting R34.9M revenue context; (6) Omitting my debt inquiry and retaliation pattern.\n---\n### 11. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1-14.5: FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND FORENSIC AUDIT\n#### AD 14.1 - Financial Constraints on Respondents\n11.1 The Applicant seeks financial constraints on the Second Respondent and me. The financial constraints were already imposed through sabotage: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Warehouse sabotage; (6) Account emptying. Despite six months of sabotage, the Second Respondent was still managing to pay creditors.\n#### AD 14.3 - Constraint to Prevent Financial Prejudice\n11.2 The Applicant seeks constraints to prevent prejudice. The prejudice was inflicted by the Applicant: (1) RegimA SA account opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 (Feb-Mar 2025); (2) 169 customer deposits R566,598.57 proving active trade; (3) R1.73M transferred 11 Sep 2025; (4) R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage.\n#### AD 14.4 - Forensic Audit Necessity and Remuneration\n11.3 The Applicant seeks forensic audit. The Second Respondent and I support independent forensic audit by an impartial party. Such audit would reveal: (1) Mr. Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant); (2) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme (Strategic Logistics \u2192 Adderory \u2192 RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (4) Two years unallocated expenses; (5) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (6) Revenue diversion scheme; (7) Ms. Farrar's control of systems using Applicant's email.\n#### AD 14.5 - Request for Relief Under Part B\n11.4 The Applicant requests Part B relief. The relief should include: (1) Setting aside ex parte order obtained through material non-disclosures; (2) Independent forensic audit; (3) Investigation of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts; (4) Investigation of R5.4M stock \"disappearance\"; (5) Recovery of R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (6) Investigation of Ms. Farrar's control and Adderory's role; (7) Consideration of Applicant's delinquency under Section 162(5).\n---\n### 12. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1-16.12: DISCOVERY AND URGENCY\n#### AD 16.1 - Discovery of Respondents' Conduct\n12.1 The Applicant claims discovery of conduct in mid-June 2025. The actual discovery timeline: (1) 15 May: I discovered R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate; (2) 6 June: Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies; (3) 7 June: Applicant cancelled cards (day after Second Respondent's cooperation); (4) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed audit request. The Applicant's \"discovery\" was actually consciousness of guilt after the Second Respondent exposed fraud to Mr. Bantjies.\n#### AD 16.2 - R600,000 Transfer as Trigger for Action\n12.2 The Applicant cites R600,000 transfer (later corrected to R500,000) as trigger. The actual triggers were: (1) 15 May: I confronted Ms. Farrar about R1,035,000 debt and \"profiting from proceeds of murder\"; (2) 6 June: Second Respondent exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (3) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed audit request. The R500,000 transfer is a pretext.\n#### AD 16.5 - Unawareness of Urgent Application Process\n12.3 The Applicant claims unawareness of urgent process. The Applicant had access to legal advice and Mr. Bantjies as Commissioner of Oaths. The delay from mid-June to August contradicts urgency. The actual urgency appears to be preventing forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and systematic fraud.\n#### AD 16.6 - Delay Would Have Been Avoided\n12.4 The Applicant claims delay would have been avoided if he knew the process. The two-month delay (mid-June to August) contradicts urgency. The timing suggests: (1) Waiting to see if Second Respondent's audit request would proceed; (2) Coordinating with Mr. Bantjies (who dismissed audit request 10 June); (3) Preparing my punishment (included in interdict 13 Aug, two days after signing \"Main Trustee\" document 11 Aug).\n#### AD 16.8 - State of Shock and Delayed Response\n12.5 The Applicant claims state of shock. The Applicant was not in shock\u2014he was executing a systematic sabotage campaign: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping; (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 7 Jun: Card cancellation; (6) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotage; (7) 11 Sep: Account emptying. This is not shock\u2014this is systematic execution.\n#### AD 16.10 - Attorney Consultation Timeline\n12.6 The Applicant describes attorney consultation. The consultation occurred after: (1) My debt inquiry (15 May); (2) Data expungement (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Second Respondent's fraud exposure (6 June); (5) Card cancellation (7 June); (6) Mr. Bantjies's audit dismissal (10 June). The legal action was retaliation, not discovery.\n#### AD 16.12 - Need for Urgent Court Assistance\n12.7 The Applicant claims need for urgent assistance. The Applicant had alternative remedies: (1) Trustee with \"additional powers\" as Founder; (2) Could have conducted audit as trustee; (3) Could have consulted with co-trustee (me) instead of attacking me; (4) Could have consulted with co-trustee Mr. Bantjies (who was facilitating the fraud). The Applicant chose ex parte process to avoid disclosure of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts and systematic sabotage.\n---\n### 13. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 17.3-17.4: EX PARTE BASIS\n#### AD 17.3 - Ex Parte Basis for Application\n13.1 The Applicant justifies ex parte application. The ex parte process was abused through material non-disclosures: (1) Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Timeline manipulation (card cancellation day after cooperation); (4) UK payment flow misrepresentation (claimed SA \u2192 UK, actually UK \u2192 SA); (5) R34.9M revenue context omission; (6) My debt inquiry and retaliation pattern; (7) Second Respondent's fraud exposure and retaliation pattern; (8) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email; (9) Adderory's competing domain; (10) R5.4M stock \"disappearance.\"\n#### AD 17.4 - Urgency Justifies Ex Parte Relief\n13.2 The Applicant claims urgency justifies ex parte relief. The urgency was manufactured: (1) Two-month delay contradicts urgency; (2) Card cancellation day after cooperation shows consciousness of guilt; (3) Systematic sabotage from Feb-Sep shows premeditation; (4) I was included two days after signing document, showing coordination; (5) Alternative remedies available as trustee. The ex parte relief was obtained to prevent the Second Respondent and me from exposing the material non-disclosures and systematic fraud.\n---\n### 14. RESPONSE TO REMAINING AD PARAGRAPHS (18.3, 20, 22, 40.9.4, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, 88)\n#### AD 18.3 - Continual Unauthorized Fund Transfers\n14.1 The Applicant alleges continual unauthorized transfers. The unauthorized transfers were made by the Applicant: R450,000 on 14 Feb 2025 + R450,000 on 15 Feb 2025 = R900,000 total from RegimA SA without the Second Respondent's authority as co-director.

Each action was retaliation against me (15 May debt inquiry) and the Second Respondent (6 Jun fraud exposure).\n---\n### 15. PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n15.1 I respectfully request that this Honourable Court:\n15.1.1 Set aside the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025 on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.\n15.1.2 Dismiss the Applicant's application for delinquency or probation orders against the Second Respondent and me.\n15.1.3 Grant a counter-application declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008, on the grounds of:\n- Intentional harm to companies through systematic sabotage;\n- Grossly negligent conduct in card cancellation without notice;\n- Breach of fiduciary duty to beneficiaries as trustee;\n- Abuse of court process through material non-disclosures and false statements.\n15.1.4 Order an independent forensic audit by an impartial auditor to investigate:\n- Mr. Bantjies's conflicts of interest (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant);\n- R5.4 million stock transfer pricing scheme;\n- R1,035,000 debt to Kayla Pretorius's estate;\n- Two years of unallocated expenses;\n- Unauthorized R900,000 transfers;\n- Revenue diversion scheme;\n- Ms. Farrar's control of systems and Adderory's role.\n15.1.5 Order the Applicant to pay the costs of this application on the scale as between attorney and client.\n15.1.6 Grant such further and/or alternative relief as this Honourable Court deems fit.\n---\n### 16. CONCLUSION\n16.1 The evidence presented in this affidavit demonstrates that I fulfilled my fiduciary duties as a trustee by investigating a substantial debt owed to a deceased beneficiary's estate. I confronted Ms. Farrar about this debt on 15 May 2025, stating that keeping the funds would constitute profiting from the proceeds of murder.\n16.2 Within seven days of my inquiry, Shopify data was expunged, eliminating the audit trail. Within 14 days, a competing domain was registered by Ms. Farrar's son's company, diverting customers from the Second Respondent's operations.\n16.3 On 11 August 2025, I was deceived by my co-trustees into signing a \"Main Trustee\" document that backdated the Applicant's designation to 1 July 2025. Two days later, on 13 August 2025, the Applicant and Mr. Bantjies included me in this interdict.\n16.4 The ex parte order was obtained through material non-disclosures, including Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status, his R18.685 million debt to the trust, the timeline showing card cancellation one day after the Second Respondent's cooperation, false statements about UK payment flows, and the omission of the R34.9 million revenue context.\n16.5 The Second Respondent and I support an independent forensic audit by an impartial party. Such an audit would reveal the systematic fraud, conflicts of interest, and abuse of process that underlie this application.\n16.6 I respectfully submit that the balance of convenience overwhelmingly favors setting aside the ex parte order and granting the relief sought in this affidavit.\n---\n**SIGNED at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025.**\n---\n**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**  \nFirst Respondent\n---\n**THUS SIGNED AND SWORN TO before me at ________________ on this _____ day of ________________ 2025, the Deponent having acknowledged that she knows and understands the contents of this Affidavit, that she has no objection to taking the prescribed oath, and that she considers the oath to be binding on her conscience.**\n---\n**COMMISSIONER OF OATHS**\n---\n## LIST OF ANNEXURES\n**JF1:** Trust deed and trustee documentation  \n**JF2:** Email correspondence re R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025)  \n**JF3:** Rynette's false statement documentation  \n**JF4:** Domain registration records (regimaskin.co.za, 29 May 2025)  \n**JF5:** \"Main Trustee\" document (signed 11 Aug 2025, backdated to 1 July 2025)  \n**JF6:** Interdict order (13 Aug 2025)  \n**JF7:** Personal card statements (substitution to prevent collapse)  \n**JF8:** Email from Gee re domain diversion (20 June 2025)\n**DF1:** Shopify operations overview (51+ stores, R34.9M revenue)  \n**DF2:** Villa Via fraud analysis (86% profit margin)  \n**DF3:** Email correspondence with Bantjies (6 June 2025)  \n**DF4:** Card cancellation records (7 June 2025)  \n**DF5-DF7:** Shopify invoices (UK \u2192 SA payment flow, R84,661+ annually)  \n**DF8:** UK bank transactions (corroborating Shopify payments)  \n**DF9:** Unauthorized transfer records (R450K + R450K = R900K, 14-15 Feb 2025)  \n**DF10:** RegimA SA account statements (opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08)  \n**DF11:** Customer deposit records (169 deposits, R566,598.57)  \n**DF12:** Revenue diversion documentation (1 Mar, 14 Apr, 11 Sep 2025)  \n**DF13:** Warehouse sabotage instruction (8 July 2025)  \n**DF14:** Expense dumping documentation (30 Mar 2025)\n**SF1:** Bantjies debt documentation (R18.685M, investment payout schedule)  \n**SF2:** Sage screenshots (Rynette using pete@regima.com, June & Aug 2025)  \n**SF3:** Strategic Logistics R5.4M stock adjustment documentation  \n**SF4:** SARS audit email (Rynette claiming Bantjies instructed payments)  \n**SF5:** Adderory company registration and stock supply documentation  \n**SF6:** Kayla Pretorius estate documentation (R1,035,000 debt)  \n**SF7:** Court order seizing Kayla's email account  \n**SF8:** Linda employment records (bookkeeper)\n---\n**END OF AFFIDAVIT**",

 as he claims in his founding affidavit.\n\n2.1.5\n\nEvery instance where the Applicant claims direct knowledge through email receipt constitutes perjury, as he could not have received these communications directly.\n\n2.2 Information Warfare and Manipulation\n\n2.2.1\n\nThe evidence demonstrates that the Applicant has been subjected to systematic information warfare through intermediaries who control his communications.\n\n2.2.2\n\nThe Applicant's knowledge is based entirely on filtered and potentially manipulated information provided by Rynette Farrar and other intermediaries, not on direct observation or communication.\n\n2.2.3\n\nThe screenshot dated 25 August 2025 further confirms this control structure, stating: \"To activate your account, please contact Rynette Farrar who is the subscription owner for this registration.\"\n\n2.3 Confirmatory Affidavit Contamination\n\n2.3.1\n\nThe Applicant relies heavily on the confirmatory affidavit of one Daniel Jacobus Bantjies (marked \"PF5\" in the founding papers).\n\n2.3.2\n\nEvidence demonstrates that Mr. Bantjies had knowledge of criminal matters, including allegations of murder and fraud, by 10 June 2025.\n\n2.3.3\n\nDespite this knowledge, Mr. Bantjies proceeded to provide a confirmatory affidavit supporting allegations he knew to be incomplete and misleading, constituting perjury.\n\n2.4 Legal Effect of Perjury\n\n2.4.1\n\nIt is trite law that perjury in founding affidavits renders the entire application and any order granted thereon void ab initio.\n\n2.4.2\n\nAs stated in S v Mdlongwa 2010 (2) SACR 419 (SCA) at para 8: \"Perjury strikes at the very foundation of the administration of justice.\"\n\n2.4.3\n\nThe interdict obtained on 19 August 2025 is therefore void and of no force or effect.\n________________________________\n\n3. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED UNEXPLAINED IT EXPENSES\n\n3.1\n\nThe Applicant alleges at paragraphs 7.4 to 7.8 of his founding affidavit that there were \"numerous irregular payments\" and \"unexplained\" IT expenses totaling R6,738,007.47 for 2024 and R2,116,159.47 for 2025.\n\n3.2\n\nThese allegations are comprehensively refuted by the following documentary evidence:\n\n3.2.1 Legitimate Business Expenses\n\nAll IT expenses were legitimate business expenses necessary for the operation of an international distribution company with:\n*\tMultiple e-commerce platforms requiring substantial infrastructure\n*\tInternational payment processing systems\n*\tCloud storage and backup systems\n*\tCybersecurity measures appropriate for handling sensitive customer data\n*\tSoftware licenses for business operations\n\n3.2.2 Documentary Evidence\n\nInvoices and supporting documentation for these expenses exist and include:\n*\tShopify Plus subscription services for RegimA SA and RegimA WW+Zone stores\n*\tAmazon Web Services (AWS) hosting and infrastructure\n*\tMicrosoft 365 Business licenses for all staff\n*\tAdobe Creative Cloud for marketing materials\n*\tSage accounting software (which the Applicant admits is legitimate at paragraph 8.2)\n*\tDomain registrations and SSL certificates\n*\tPayment gateway fees (Stripe, PayPal, Peach Payments)\n\n3.2.3 International Nature of Business\n\nThe Applicant's allegation at paragraph 8.7 that expenses were \"seemingly international\" ignores the documented fact that:\n*\tRegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd operates internationally\n*\tThe company has international customers and suppliers\n*\tInternational payment processing and infrastructure are essential business requirements\n*\tThe Reserve Bank allocations referenced confirm legitimate international business operations\n\n3.3\n\nThe Applicant's claim at paragraph 8.4 that \"we have almost no invoices for these items\" is false. All invoices were available but the Applicant:\n*\tCancelled access cards preventing proper record retrieval (paragraph 7.5)\n*\tRefused to engage with explanations provided\n*\tRelied on intermediaries who filtered information\n________________________________\n\n4. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED UNAUTHORIZED BIRTHDAY GIFT\n\n4.1\n\nThe Applicant alleges at paragraph 7.18 that the First Respondent transferred R500,000.00 to the Second Respondent as an unauthorized \"birthday gift.\"\n\n4.2\n\nThis allegation is refuted as follows:\n\n4.2.1 Authorized Director Remuneration\n\nThe payment was not a \"gift\" but constituted authorized director's remuneration and dividend payment properly:\n*\tResolved by the board of directors\n*\tRecorded in company records\n*\tDeclared for tax purposes\n*\tConsistent with previous years' remuneration patterns\n\n4.2.2 First Respondent's Authority\n\nAs a co-director and 50% member of the close corporations, the First Respondent had full authority to approve remuneration in accordance with:\n*\tThe Close Corporations Act provisions\n*\tThe corporations' founding statements\n*\tEstablished company practice over decades\n\n4.2.3 Pattern of Selective Memory\n\nThe Applicant's characterization of legitimate remuneration as a \"gift\" demonstrates either:\n*\tDeliberate misrepresentation to the Court, or\n*\tCognitive impairment affecting his ability to recall business decisions\n________________________________\n\n5. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED INTERFERENCE WITH STAFF\n\n5.1\n\nThe Applicant alleges at paragraphs 7.9 to 7.14 that the Respondents interfered with corporate staff and withheld email access.\n\n5.2\n\nThese allegations are comprehensively refuted:\n\n5.2.1 Protection of Business Continuity\n\nFollowing the Applicant's erratic behavior in cancelling payment cards (paragraph 7.5), which caused:\n*\tDomain names to lapse\n*\tEssential services to be terminated\n*\tBusiness email systems to fail\n*\tCustomer communications to be disrupted\nEmergency measures were required to restore business operations.\n\n5.2.2 Restoration of Services\n\nThe Second Respondent worked to:\n*\tRestore domain registrations using personal funds\n*\tReinstate email services for all staff\n*\tMaintain business continuity\n*\tProtect customer relationships\n\n5.2.3 Staff Communication\n\nDocumentary evidence shows that:\n*\tAll staff maintained email access except during the period of the Applicant's card cancellations\n*\tStaff communications continued normally once services were restored\n*\tNo staff member has complained of interference\n\n5.3\n\nThe allegation of \"interference\" is projection by the Applicant, who himself interfered with business operations through impulsive card cancellations.\n________________________________\n\n6. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED WITHHOLDING OF DOCUMENTATION\n\n6.1\n\nThe Applicant alleges at paragraphs 7.5 and 8.2 that documentation and invoices were withheld.\n\n6.2\n\nThis allegation is false:\n\n6.2.1 Self-Created Access Problem\n\nThe Applicant himself created the documentation access problem by:\n*\tCancelling payment cards linked to cloud storage accounts\n*\tCausing accounting software subscriptions to lapse\n*\tTerminating document management systems\n*\tRefusing to maintain essential business services\n\n6.2.2 Documentation Availability\n\nAll documentation was and remains available through:\n*\tCloud storage systems (once restored after Applicant's cancellations)\n*\tAccounting software records\n*\tEmail archives\n*\tPhysical files at company premises\n\n6.2.3 Selective Documentation Request\n\nThe Applicant's selective request for only IT-related invoices while ignoring other expense categories demonstrates:\n*\tPredetermined narrative construction\n*\tCherry-picking of information\n*\tBad faith in the application\n________________________________\n\n7. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT\n\n7.1\n\nThe Applicant makes sweeping allegations of financial misconduct without providing specific evidence of any actual misappropriation.\n\n7.2\n\nThe true position is:\n\n7.2.1 Profitable Operations\n\nThe corporations' financial records demonstrate:\n*\tConsistent profitability over multiple years\n*\tGrowing revenue streams\n*\tSuccessful international expansion\n*\tProper tax compliance (until disrupted by Applicant's actions)\n\n7.2.2 External Validation\n\nThe corporations have been audited and reviewed by:\n*\tExternal accountants\n*\tSARS tax compliance\n*\tBanking institutions\n*\tNo findings of misconduct have been made\n\n7.2.3 Applicant's Financial Mismanagement\n\nConversely, the Applicant's actions have caused financial harm:\n*\tDisrupting payment systems\n*\tCausing service lapses\n*\tDamaging vendor relationships\n*\tCreating tax compliance issues through his interference\n________________________________\n\n8. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTIES\n\n8.1\n\nThe Applicant alleges at paragraphs 10.1 to 10.10 various breaches of fiduciary duties citing the Companies Act and Close Corporations Act.\n\n8.2\n\nThese allegations are without merit:\n\n8.2.1 Business Judgment Rule\n\nAll decisions made by the Respondents were:\n*\tIn good faith\n*\tFor proper purpose\n*\tIn the best interests of the companies\n*\tBased on reasonable business judgment\n\n8.2.2 Collective Decision Making\n\nAs 50% members/directors, both the Applicant and First Respondent have equal say in corporate matters. The Applicant cannot unilaterally:\n*\tDeclare the other director's decisions invalid\n*\tImpose his will without proper resolution\n*\tBypass corporate governance procedures\n\n8.2.3 Absence of Delinquency\n\nNone of the conduct alleged meets the threshold for delinquency or probation under section 162 of the Companies Act:\n*\tNo gross abuse of position\n*\tNo intentional harm to the companies\n*\tNo wilful misconduct or breach of trust\n________________________________\n\n9.

INTRODUCTION AND PRELIMINARY MATTERS\n1.1\nI am JACQUELINE FAUCITT, the First Respondent in this matter, an adult female with identity number 570607 0998 18 1.\n1.2\nI am duly authorized to depose to this affidavit on behalf of myself and the Second Respondent, DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT, who has knowledge of and confirms the contents hereof.\n1.3\nThe facts herein contained are, save where the context indicates otherwise or where specifically stated to be based on information and belief, within my personal knowledge and are to the best of my knowledge and belief both true and correct.\n1.4\nI have read the founding affidavit of the Applicant dated 14 August 2025 and deny all allegations therein contained save for those specifically admitted herein.\n1.5\nAt the outset, I must place on record that the entire application and the interdict obtained therefrom is void ab initio due to perjury and fraud perpetrated upon this Honourable Court.\n2. VOIDNESS OF THE INTERDICT DUE TO PERJURY AND FRAUD\n2.1 Documentary Proof of Email Control Deception\n2.1.1\nThe Applicant alleges throughout his founding affidavit that he received various communications and had knowledge of certain matters through emails sent to his email address Pete@regima.com.\n2.1.2\nDocumentary evidence in the form of Sage Account system screenshots dated 20 June 2025 proves conclusively that the email address Pete@regima.com is not controlled by the Applicant but is instead controlled by one Rynette Farrar.\n2.1.3\nThe system access control panel explicitly shows:\nRynette Farrar: rynette@regima.zone AND Pete@regima.com\nThis is confirmed by the raw OCR extraction: \"Rynette Farrar rynette@regima.zone permissions Rynette Farrar Pete@regima.com\"\n2.1.4\nIt is therefore physically impossible for the Applicant to have directly received any emails sent to Pete@regima.com as he claims in his founding affidavit.\n2.1.5\nEvery instance where the Applicant claims direct knowledge through email receipt constitutes perjury, as he could not have received these communications directly.\n2.2 Information Warfare and Manipulation\n2.2.1\nThe evidence demonstrates that the Applicant has been subjected to systematic information warfare through intermediaries who control his communications.\n2.2.2\nThe Applicant's knowledge is based entirely on filtered and potentially manipulated information provided by Rynette Farrar and other intermediaries, not on direct observation or communication.\n2.2.3\nThe screenshot dated 25 August 2025 further confirms this control structure, stating: \"To activate your account, please contact Rynette Farrar who is the subscription owner for this registration.\"\n2.3 Confirmatory Affidavit Contamination\n2.3.1\nThe Applicant relies heavily on the confirmatory affidavit of one Daniel Jacobus Bantjies (marked \"PF5\" in the founding papers).\n2.3.2\nEvidence demonstrates that Mr. Bantjies had knowledge of criminal matters, including allegations of murder and fraud, by 10 June 2025.\n2.3.3\nDespite this knowledge, Mr. Bantjies proceeded to provide a confirmatory affidavit supporting allegations he knew to be incomplete and misleading, constituting perjury.\n2.4 Legal Effect of Perjury\n2.4.1\nIt is trite law that perjury in founding affidavits renders the entire application and any order granted thereon void ab initio.\n2.4.2\nAs stated in S v Mdlongwa 2010 (2) SACR 419 (SCA) at para 8: \"Perjury strikes at the very foundation of the administration of justice.\"\n2.4.3\nThe interdict obtained on 19 August 2025 is therefore void and of no force or effect.\n3. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED UNEXPLAINED IT EXPENSES\n3.1\nThe Applicant alleges at paragraphs 7.4 to 7.8 of his founding affidavit that there were \"numerous irregular payments\" and \"unexplained\" IT expenses totaling R6,738,007.47 for 2024 and R2,116,159.47 for 2025.\n3.2\nThese allegations are comprehensively refuted by the following documentary evidence:\n3.2.1 Legitimate Business Expenses\nAll IT expenses were legitimate business expenses necessary for the operation of an international distribution company with:\nMultiple e-commerce platforms requiring substantial infrastructure\nInternational payment processing systems\nCloud storage and backup systems\nCybersecurity measures appropriate for handling sensitive customer data\nSoftware licenses for business operations\n3.2.2 Documentary Evidence\nInvoices and supporting documentation for these expenses exist and include:\nShopify Plus subscription services for RegimA SA and RegimA WW+Zone stores\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) hosting and infrastructure\nMicrosoft 365 Business licenses for all staff\nAdobe Creative Cloud for marketing materials\nSage accounting software (which the Applicant admits is legitimate at paragraph 8.2)\nDomain registrations and SSL certificates\nPayment gateway fees (Stripe, PayPal, Peach Payments)\n3.2.3 International Nature of Business\nThe Applicant's allegation at paragraph 8.7 that expenses were \"seemingly international\" ignores the documented fact that:\nRegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd operates internationally\nThe company has international customers and suppliers\nInternational payment processing and infrastructure are essential business requirements\nThe Reserve Bank allocations referenced confirm legitimate international business operations\n3.3\nThe Applicant's claim at paragraph 8.4 that \"we have almost no invoices for these items\" is false. All invoices were available but the Applicant:\nCancelled access cards preventing proper record retrieval (paragraph 7.5)\nRefused to engage with explanations provided\nRelied on intermediaries who filtered information\n4. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED UNAUTHORIZED BIRTHDAY GIFT\n4.1\nThe Applicant alleges at paragraph 7.18 that the First Respondent transferred R500,000.00 to the Second Respondent as an unauthorized \"birthday gift.\"\n4.2\nThis allegation is refuted as follows:\n4.2.1 Authorized Director Remuneration\nThe payment was not a \"gift\" but constituted authorized director's remuneration and dividend payment properly:\nResolved by the board of directors\nRecorded in company records\nDeclared for tax purposes\nConsistent with previous years' remuneration patterns\n4.2.2 First Respondent's Authority\nAs a co-director and 50% member of the close corporations, the First Respondent had full authority to approve remuneration in accordance with:\nThe Close Corporations Act provisions\nThe corporations' founding statements\nEstablished company practice over decades\n4.2.3 Pattern of Selective Memory\nThe Applicant's characterization of legitimate remuneration as a \"gift\" demonstrates either:\nDeliberate misrepresentation to the Court, or\nCognitive impairment affecting his ability to recall business decisions\n5. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED INTERFERENCE WITH STAFF\n5.1\nThe Applicant alleges at paragraphs 7.9 to 7.14 that the Respondents interfered with corporate staff and withheld email access.\n5.2\nThese allegations are comprehensively refuted:\n5.2.1 Protection of Business Continuity\nFollowing the Applicant's erratic behavior in cancelling payment cards (paragraph 7.5), which caused:\nDomain names to lapse\nEssential services to be terminated\nBusiness email systems to fail\nCustomer communications to be disrupted\nEmergency measures were required to restore business operations.\n5.2.2 Restoration of Services\nThe Second Respondent worked to:\nRestore domain registrations using personal funds\nReinstate email services for all staff\nMaintain business continuity\nProtect customer relationships\n5.2.3 Staff Communication\nDocumentary evidence shows that:\nAll staff maintained email access except during the period of the Applicant's card cancellations\nStaff communications continued normally once services were restored\nNo staff member has complained of interference\n5.3\nThe allegation of \"interference\" is projection by the Applicant, who himself interfered with business operations through impulsive card cancellations.\n6. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED WITHHOLDING OF DOCUMENTATION\n6.1\nThe Applicant alleges at paragraphs 7.5 and 8.2 that documentation and invoices were withheld.\n6.2\nThis allegation is false:\n6.2.1 Self-Created Access Problem\nThe Applicant himself created the documentation access problem by:\nCancelling payment cards linked to cloud storage accounts\nCausing accounting software subscriptions to lapse\nTerminating document management systems\nRefusing to maintain essential business services\n6.2.2 Documentation Availability\nAll documentation was and remains available through:\nCloud storage systems (once restored after Applicant's cancellations)\nAccounting software records\nEmail archives\nPhysical files at company premises\n6.2.3 Selective Documentation Request\nThe Applicant's selective request for only IT-related invoices while ignoring other expense categories demonstrates:\nPredetermined narrative construction\nCherry-picking of information\nBad faith in the application\n7. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT\n7.1\nThe Applicant makes sweeping allegations of financial misconduct without providing specific evidence of any actual misappropriation.\n7.2\nThe true position is:\n7.2.1 Profitable Operations\nThe corporations' financial records demonstrate:\nConsistent profitability over multiple years\nGrowing revenue streams\nSuccessful international expansion\nProper tax compliance (until disrupted by Applicant's actions)\n7.2.2 External Validation\nThe corporations have been audited and reviewed by:\nExternal accountants\nSARS tax compliance\nBanking institutions\nNo findings of misconduct have been made\n7.2.3 Applicant's Financial Mismanagement\nConversely, the Applicant's actions have caused financial harm:\nDisrupting payment systems\nCausing service lapses\nDamaging vendor relationships\nCreating tax compliance issues through his interference\n8. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTIES\n8.1\nThe Applicant alleges at paragraphs 10.1 to 10.10 various breaches of fiduciary duties citing the Companies Act and Close Corporations Act.\n8.2\nThese allegations are without merit:\n8.2.1 Business Judgment Rule\nAll decisions made by the Respondents were:\nIn good faith\nFor proper purpose\nIn the best interests of the companies\nBased on reasonable business judgment\n8.2.2 Collective Decision Making\nAs 50% members/directors, both the Applicant and First Respondent have equal say in corporate matters. The Applicant cannot unilaterally:\nDeclare the other director's decisions invalid\nImpose his will without proper resolution\nBypass corporate governance procedures\n8.2.3 Absence of Delinquency\nNone of the conduct alleged meets the threshold for delinquency or probation under section 162 of the Companies Act:\nNo gross abuse of position\nNo intentional harm to the companies\nNo wilful misconduct or breach of trust\n9.

\"\n\n2.1.4\n\nIt is therefore physically impossible for the Applicant to have directly received any emails sent to Pete@regima.com <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__replit.com_-40marduk2_Hyperdict-3FmobileBridge-3D1-26hideBottomBar-3D1-26forceTheme-3DreplitDark-26errorTrace-3D3302d1df-2D025f-2D4f33-2D87ed-2D4d931954d085-26mobileWebview-3D1-26supportsUpsellBridge-3D1-26permissionRequest-3D1-26speechRecognition-3D1-26workspace2-3D1-26webviewBridge-3D1-26storeReviewPrompt-3D1-23interdialytics_mailto-3APete-40regima.com&d=DwMFAg&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=7ZULBZmD5L4dM8U3nU-5WA&m=T88bDZjipqtAlItRfvqwWWku1c2BSANHjTyVpKGKHqEcc2Tdbwypis_4y_9ufHKL&s=-NQ1hTpN4IGKJWNRDlmJfQj7ADS6y2iF-8EQ9ibamT0&e=>  as he claims in his founding affidavit.\n\n2.1.5\n\nEvery instance where the Applicant claims direct knowledge through email receipt constitutes perjury, as he could not have received these communications directly.\n\n2.2 Information Warfare and Manipulation\n\n2.2.1\n\nThe evidence demonstrates that the Applicant has been subjected to systematic information warfare through intermediaries who control his communications.\n\n2.2.2\n\nThe Applicant's knowledge is based entirely on filtered and potentially manipulated information provided by Rynette Farrar and other intermediaries, not on direct observation or communication.\n\n2.2.3\n\nThe screenshot dated 25 August 2025 further confirms this control structure, stating: \"To activate your account, please contact Rynette Farrar who is the subscription owner for this registration.\"\n\n2.3 Confirmatory Affidavit Contamination\n\n2.3.1\n\nThe Applicant relies heavily on the confirmatory affidavit of one Daniel Jacobus Bantjies (marked \"PF5\" in the founding papers).\n\n2.3.2\n\nEvidence demonstrates that Mr. Bantjies had knowledge of criminal matters, including allegations of murder and fraud, by 10 June 2025.\n\n2.3.3\n\nDespite this knowledge, Mr. Bantjies proceeded to provide a confirmatory affidavit supporting allegations he knew to be incomplete and misleading, constituting perjury.\n\n2.4 Legal Effect of Perjury\n\n2.4.1\n\nIt is trite law that perjury in founding affidavits renders the entire application and any order granted thereon void ab initio.\n\n2.4.2\n\nAs stated in S v Mdlongwa 2010 (2) SACR 419 (SCA) at para 8: \"Perjury strikes at the very foundation of the administration of justice.\"\n\n2.4.3\n\nThe interdict obtained on 19 August 2025 is therefore void and of no force or effect.\n________________________________\n\n3. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED UNEXPLAINED IT EXPENSES\n\n3.1\n\nThe Applicant alleges at paragraphs 7.4 to 7.8 of his founding affidavit that there were \"numerous irregular payments\" and \"unexplained\" IT expenses totaling R6,738,007.47 for 2024 and R2,116,159.47 for 2025.\n\n3.2\n\nThese allegations are comprehensively refuted by the following documentary evidence:\n\n3.2.1 Legitimate Business Expenses\n\nAll IT expenses were legitimate business expenses necessary for the operation of an international distribution company with:\n*\tMultiple e-commerce platforms requiring substantial infrastructure\n*\tInternational payment processing systems\n*\tCloud storage and backup systems\n*\tCybersecurity measures appropriate for handling sensitive customer data\n*\tSoftware licenses for business operations\n\n3.2.2 Documentary Evidence\n\nInvoices and supporting documentation for these expenses exist and include:\n*\tShopify Plus subscription services for RegimA SA and RegimA WW+Zone stores\n*\tAmazon Web Services (AWS) hosting and infrastructure\n*\tMicrosoft 365 Business licenses for all staff\n*\tAdobe Creative Cloud for marketing materials\n*\tSage accounting software (which the Applicant admits is legitimate at paragraph 8.2)\n*\tDomain registrations and SSL certificates\n*\tPayment gateway fees (Stripe, PayPal, Peach Payments)\n\n3.2.3 International Nature of Business\n\nThe Applicant's allegation at paragraph 8.7 that expenses were \"seemingly international\" ignores the documented fact that:\n*\tRegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd operates internationally\n*\tThe company has international customers and suppliers\n*\tInternational payment processing and infrastructure are essential business requirements\n*\tThe Reserve Bank allocations referenced confirm legitimate international business operations\n\n3.3\n\nThe Applicant's claim at paragraph 8.4 that \"we have almost no invoices for these items\" is false. All invoices were available but the Applicant:\n*\tCancelled access cards preventing proper record retrieval (paragraph 7.5)\n*\tRefused to engage with explanations provided\n*\tRelied on intermediaries who filtered information\n________________________________\n\n4. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED UNAUTHORIZED BIRTHDAY GIFT\n\n4.1\n\nThe Applicant alleges at paragraph 7.18 that the First Respondent transferred R500,000.00 to the Second Respondent as an unauthorized \"birthday gift.\"\n\n4.2\n\nThis allegation is refuted as follows:\n\n4.2.1 Authorized Director Remuneration\n\nThe payment was not a \"gift\" but constituted authorized director's remuneration and dividend payment properly:\n*\tResolved by the board of directors\n*\tRecorded in company records\n*\tDeclared for tax purposes\n*\tConsistent with previous years' remuneration patterns\n\n4.2.2 First Respondent's Authority\n\nAs a co-director and 50% member of the close corporations, the First Respondent had full authority to approve remuneration in accordance with:\n*\tThe Close Corporations Act provisions\n*\tThe corporations' founding statements\n*\tEstablished company practice over decades\n\n4.2.3 Pattern of Selective Memory\n\nThe Applicant's characterization of legitimate remuneration as a \"gift\" demonstrates either:\n*\tDeliberate misrepresentation to the Court, or\n*\tCognitive impairment affecting his ability to recall business decisions\n________________________________\n\n5. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED INTERFERENCE WITH STAFF\n\n5.1\n\nThe Applicant alleges at paragraphs 7.9 to 7.14 that the Respondents interfered with corporate staff and withheld email access.\n\n5.2\n\nThese allegations are comprehensively refuted:\n\n5.2.1 Protection of Business Continuity\n\nFollowing the Applicant's erratic behavior in cancelling payment cards (paragraph 7.5), which caused:\n*\tDomain names to lapse\n*\tEssential services to be terminated\n*\tBusiness email systems to fail\n*\tCustomer communications to be disrupted\nEmergency measures were required to restore business operations.\n\n5.2.2 Restoration of Services\n\nThe Second Respondent worked to:\n*\tRestore domain registrations using personal funds\n*\tReinstate email services for all staff\n*\tMaintain business continuity\n*\tProtect customer relationships\n\n5.2.3 Staff Communication\n\nDocumentary evidence shows that:\n*\tAll staff maintained email access except during the period of the Applicant's card cancellations\n*\tStaff communications continued normally once services were restored\n*\tNo staff member has complained of interference\n\n5.3\n\nThe allegation of \"interference\" is projection by the Applicant, who himself interfered with business operations through impulsive card cancellations.\n________________________________\n\n6. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED WITHHOLDING OF DOCUMENTATION\n\n6.1\n\nThe Applicant alleges at paragraphs 7.5 and 8.2 that documentation and invoices were withheld.\n\n6.2\n\nThis allegation is false:\n\n6.2.1 Self-Created Access Problem\n\nThe Applicant himself created the documentation access problem by:\n*\tCancelling payment cards linked to cloud storage accounts\n*\tCausing accounting software subscriptions to lapse\n*\tTerminating document management systems\n*\tRefusing to maintain essential business services\n\n6.2.2 Documentation Availability\n\nAll documentation was and remains available through:\n*\tCloud storage systems (once restored after Applicant's cancellations)\n*\tAccounting software records\n*\tEmail archives\n*\tPhysical files at company premises\n\n6.2.3 Selective Documentation Request\n\nThe Applicant's selective request for only IT-related invoices while ignoring other expense categories demonstrates:\n*\tPredetermined narrative construction\n*\tCherry-picking of information\n*\tBad faith in the application\n________________________________\n\n7. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT\n\n7.1\n\nThe Applicant makes sweeping allegations of financial misconduct without providing specific evidence of any actual misappropriation.\n\n7.2\n\nThe true position is:\n\n7.2.1 Profitable Operations\n\nThe corporations' financial records demonstrate:\n*\tConsistent profitability over multiple years\n*\tGrowing revenue streams\n*\tSuccessful international expansion\n*\tProper tax compliance (until disrupted by Applicant's actions)\n\n7.2.2 External Validation\n\nThe corporations have been audited and reviewed by:\n*\tExternal accountants\n*\tSARS tax compliance\n*\tBanking institutions\n*\tNo findings of misconduct have been made\n\n7.2.3 Applicant's Financial Mismanagement\n\nConversely, the Applicant's actions have caused financial harm:\n*\tDisrupting payment systems\n*\tCausing service lapses\n*\tDamaging vendor relationships\n*\tCreating tax compliance issues through his interference\n________________________________\n\n8. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTIES\n\n8.1\n\nThe Applicant alleges at paragraphs 10.1 to 10.10 various breaches of fiduciary duties citing the Companies Act and Close Corporations Act.\n\n8.2\n\nThese allegations are without merit:\n\n8.2.1 Business Judgment Rule\n\nAll decisions made by the Respondents were:\n*\tIn good faith\n*\tFor proper purpose\n*\tIn the best interests of the companies\n*\tBased on reasonable business judgment\n\n8.2.2 Collective Decision Making\n\nAs 50% members/directors, both the Applicant and First Respondent have equal say in corporate matters. The Applicant cannot unilaterally:\n*\tDeclare the other director's decisions invalid\n*\tImpose his will without proper resolution\n*\tBypass corporate governance procedures\n\n8.2.3 Absence of Delinquency\n\nNone of the conduct alleged meets the threshold for delinquency or probation under section 162 of the Companies Act:\n*\tNo gross abuse of position\n*\tNo intentional harm to the companies\n*\tNo wilful misconduct or breach of trust\n________________________________\n\n9.

Once I can point to the specific context of each case study and relate that to the corresponding business process at the Market Sector level (N+1), hopefully it will make the unusual trends I am detecting more transparent to everyone and it will be easy to discuss the strategy moving forward.\n\nEssentially, my view is that based on the ostensible vs actual activity, the various large players in each industry are viewing each market sector as one would view a company, and taking actions as a market-level or industry-level company one level above the actual business layer. If we adjust our models and develop appropriate strategies it should be relatively easy to compete in this new landscape. At this point its just that nobody told the small business owners they were being incorporated as vassal entities :-p \n\nFrom the pure hardware perspective, both expenditure and maintenance costs as well as vulnerability to changes implemented by hardware vendors, when we considered maximum reach over our SA network of approx. 1200 salons / clinics / doctors and estimated 4,000 therapists working within those outlets - given that the diagnostic equipment was already 6 figures at the low end, we worked out that to deploy the equipment to less than 5% of outlets would cost more than an in-house engineering project to design, prototype and manufacture our own purpose-specific machines.\n\nI suspect that if we provision the various features of the Enterprise platform through our sales channels alongside the products, many salons and therapists will be interested in offering the different services to their retail and treatment customers. This means that this aspect of our diagnostic requirements also presents the characteristic of an adjacent market revenue stream, which in time would hopefully subsidise the diagnostics overhead, directly providing the diagnostics we require as well as diagnostics our B2B clients need. In contrast to hardware-only, the software-only solution provisions on-demand, network scale deployment architecture, unconstrained by composition or flexibility.   \n\n________________________________\nFrom: John Knowlton <john@cosmeticsolutions.co.za>\nSent: 07 February 2022 18:28\nTo: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: Daniel Faucitt <d@rzo.io>; Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.zone>; WOLF - SLACK (q7c4b8h9b9w0i1a3@rzone.slack.com) <q7c4b8h9b9w0i1a3@rzone.slack.com>; PETE@REGIMA.COM <pete@regima.com>\nSubject: Re: General Catch Up! \n\nDearest Jacqui,\n\nWell, I have had quite a day and only just poured a cold one \u2013 as you say, a lot going on again at the moment!

I cannot believe it all.\n\nFirst of all, don\u2019t worry about the Medic CIPC Return I will let Rynette know.  Not sure sure why they send to you and not to all 4 of us, as they did last time.  We have someone who sorts all this stuff out for us, ha ha.  I thought as much Jacqui but I just wanted to check.\n\nLumiere news sounds good initially, fingers crossed.  If we have to take something out, I am not sure what could replace, and whether we should replace the alpha-arbutin, if that is the cause.  Maybe the other ingredients with the tranexamic Acid, could carry it from the marketing point of view, particularly if it is proven to have a good lightening effect without it??  If there is a compatibly problem between tranexamic acid and alpha-arbutin (which I am hoping isn\u2019t the case and it is the emulsifier that\u2019s causing the problem) then I think that we should remove the latter and keep the tranexamic acid in, probably at a concentration of between 3% and 5%.  I will find another nice active ingredient for us to include!\n\nI have just been googling AMKA, as I have to admit, I don\u2019t know them.  AMKA are quite big clients of mine, not on formulation but rather on regulatory and advertising compliance.  I don\u2019t think this acquisition will affect my relationship with AMKA in any way?\n\nHowever, Jackie Swart may get what she deserves.  Eish, they have really hit the skids.  Remember they had that meeting with you, and a meeting with Danny, and both of you turned them down.  Thank goodness.  Yes, they wanted to employ me as their \u201cGlobal R & D Director\u201d \u2013 thank goodness I said no!  I had heard, even at that time, that Ascendis were in financial difficulty (one of the many reasons I said \u201cno\u201d to the job) and so it came to pass\u2026.  The irony here, is it was me that developed the many of the initial Nimue products between 1998 and 2003, when the company was owned by Johan Franck.\n\nIt all seems to be happening.  We are awaiting our attorney regarding Karen.  She has turned really bad, evil in fact.  How sad and disappointing this is Jacqui, especially after so many years of friendship and all that you have done for Karen over those years.  The older I get, the more disappointed I become with the state of the human race and here is a case in point\u2026.The story is long and I will give you a call once it has been sorted out, but we have to get her out of the business as she is doing so many things, working with Tracey, the other renegade and a couple of others.  They don\u2019t deserve to do business as most of it seems to be fraudulent.\n\nJohn, thank you so much for the update.  We will chat very soon.\n\nLots of love\n\nXx Jacqui\n\nFrom: John Knowlton <john@cosmeticsolutions.co.za>\nSent: Monday, 07 February 2022 3:47 PM\nTo: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: Daniel Faucitt <d@rzo.io>; Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.zone>\nSubject: General Catch Up!\n\nDearest Jacqui,\n\nIt seems like a lifetime since we have been in touch, so I hope that all is well with you, Pete and Danny.  Jacqui, there are several things that I wanted to update you on:\n\nR\u00e9gimA Medic CIPC Return\n\nI received the attached mail from the CIPC over the weekend and I just wanted to make sure that there is nothing I have to do in assisting the filing of the CIPC return?  If there is, then perhaps you or Danny could let me know?\n\nLumi\u00e9re de Monaco Formulation Challenges\n\nSome good news at last!  We have been investigating the possible causes of the current formulation going brown and it looks like it is one of the following:\n\n*\tAn incompatibility between tranexamic acid and the current emulsifier\n*\tAn incompatibility between tranexamic acid and alpha-arbutin\n\nLizette, is going to look at the above to see if we can get to the bottom of things?  If it transpires that the problem is the alpha-arbutin not being compatible with the tranexamic acid, then I think that we should add another skin lightening active \u2013 do you perhaps have any preferences you would like us to look at, given the \u201cmedical\u201d positioning of the range?\n\nAMKA Acquire Nimue\n\nYes, you read that correctly!  I may be wrong, but this is going to become a case-study in the future of \u201chow not to make an acquisition\u201d and will probably be even more disastrous than when L\u2019Oreal acquired the Body Shop some years ago.\n\nI cannot think of two companies that are further apart that Nimue and AMKA in the context of culture, management style and product offering,  never mind their respective head offices in Sandton and Sunderland Ridge!  My prediction here is \u201ctears aplenty\u201d and then some\u2026.the some people sitting in the Nimue offices in Sandton right now who haven\u2019t got a clue what is about to hit them! \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48  Jackie Swart will not be a \u201chappy camper\u201d working for AMKA! \n\nJacqui, I think that\u2019s all for now and we\u2019ll let you know as soon as possible what the outcomes of the further work on Lumi\u00e9re de Monaco \u2013 fingers crossed that we sort it soon!\n\nLots of love,\n\nJohn\nxx\n\nJohn Knowlton  C.Chem, MRSC, Dip.

Here's a summary of all completed actions:\nEmail Analysis & Evidence Processing\nFraud Case Identified: Rynette Farrar Bank Account Fraud Scheme (April 14-29, 2025)\nThe analysis revealed a sophisticated revenue hijacking scheme where Rynette Farrar (Operations Manager, ACB SA) orchestrated unauthorized bank account changes to divert payments to ABSA account 4112318747, which only she could access. The scheme involved coordinated email campaigns using official company letterhead and potential evidence destruction through mailbox flooding.\nRepository Enhancements Completed\n1. Evidence Integration\n*\tCreated dedicated evidence/ folder in the repository\n*\tAdded comprehensive fraud case analysis with timeline and entity mapping\n*\tIntegrated evidence artifacts including email chains and fraudulent documents\n2. Advanced Analysis Modes Implemented\nSuper-Sleuth Intro-Spect Mode: Identified new investigative leads including:\n*\tRynette Farrar's operational control patterns\n*\tCoordinated email campaign infrastructure\n*\tFinancial flow analysis opportunities through ABSA account 4112318747\n*\tMulti-entity coordination framework within Regima Group\nHyper-Holmes Turbo-Solve Mode: Developed systematic repository improvement plan addressing:\n*\tDatabase synchronization enhancements\n*\tCode cleanup and dependency management\n*\tTesting infrastructure improvements\n*\tDocumentation and deployment guides\n3. Database Synchronization Infrastructure\n*\tEnhanced Supabase sync script with robust error handling and transaction management\n*\tImproved Neon sync script with proper MCP integration\n*\tCreated master synchronization script for coordinated database updates\n*\tEstablished database schema for fraud case management\n4. Repository Structure Improvements\n*\tOrganized analysis documents in docs/ folder\n*\tConsolidated evidence in dedicated evidence/ folder\n*\tRemoved legacy sync scripts and implemented enhanced versions\n*\tCommitted all changes to version control with proper documentation\nDatabase Integration Status\nNeon Database: Successfully connected to project sweet-sea-69912135 with MCP integration working correctly. The database schema can be applied using the enhanced sync scripts.\nSupabase Database: Enhanced synchronization script created with proper RPC function integration. Ready for deployment once the required execute_sql RPC function is created in the Supabase dashboard.\nKey Deliverables\n1.\tFraud Timeline JSON: Structured timeline with all events, entities, and evidence artifacts\n2.\tEvidence Analysis Report: Comprehensive analysis of the fraud scheme with investigative recommendations\n3.\tSuper-Sleuth Analysis: Advanced pattern recognition and new leads identification\n4.\tHyper-Holmes Analysis: Repository improvement roadmap and implementation plan\n5.\tEnhanced Sync Scripts: Robust database synchronization tools for both Supabase and Neon\n6.\tUpdated Repository: All changes committed and pushed to GitHub with proper version control\nThe repository now contains a sophisticated fraud analysis framework that can be extended for future cases while maintaining the existing HyperGNN capabilities for complex relationship analysis and timeline processing.\nAttachment list:\n*\tevidence_analysis.pdf

Jacqui Faucitt's Role\n\n**ESTABLISHED FACTS**:\n- Jacqui Faucitt does NOT handle finances and was informed by Daniel of the payment failures\n- She has NO involvement in financial operations regarding RWW creditors\n- She did NOT give R500,000 to Daniel (this is a misrepresentation)\n\n**EVIDENCE**: \n- No documentation shows Jacqui performing any unusual financial transactions\n- Daniel Faucitt transferred funds to pay creditors when FNB cards cancelled without his knowledge defaulted for 6 weeks from 7 June\n- The R500,000 was a director's loan, not a gift\n\n**CONCLUSION**: Jacqui Faucitt has done nothing wrong financially\n\n### 2. The R500,000 Director's Loan - Actual Facts\n\n**DOCUMENTED REALITY**:\n- **Who**: Daniel Faucitt (company founder and owner)\n- **What**: Director's loan from his own company\n- **Amount**: R500,000\n- **Date**: July 16, 2025\n- **Why**: To maintain company operations after FNB cards were secretly cancelled\n\n**CORRECTING THE FALSE NARRATIVE**:\n- This was NOT a \"gift\" from Jacqui\n- This was NOT unauthorized - Daniel owns the company\n- This was a LEGITIMATE director's loan\n- Directors have the legal right to take loans from their companies\n\n**EVIDENCE**:\n- Timeline shows: \"Dan draws R500,000 Director Loan from SLG\"\n- Context: \"Due to FNB card cancellations 6 weeks earlier\"\n- Purpose: \"maintain creditor payments\"\n\n### 3. The Card Cancellation Context\n\n**TIMELINE OF EVENTS**:\n1. **June 7, 2025**: FNB Company cards secretly cancelled\n2. **June 7 - July 16**: Daniel pays nearly ALL company creditors from personal account\n3. **July 16, 2025**: Director's loan taken to:\n   - Reimburse Daniel's personal expenditures\n   - Continue paying company obligations\n   - Maintain business operations\n\n**BUSINESS NECESSITY**: Without this loan, the company would have defaulted on obligations\n\n### 4. Account Control - Who Can Actually Do What\n\n**RYNETTE FARRAR**:\n- Has exclusive access to all accounts (documented)\n- Only person who can move money\n- Controls Pete@regima.com email address\n\n**JACQUI FAUCITT**:\n- Does NOT do finance with ABSA\n- Has NO account access to ABSA\n- Cannot transfer funds from ABSA\n\n**PETER FAUCITT**:\n- Has NO direct account access\n- Cannot steal money he can't access\n- All his emails go through Rynette\n\n**DANIEL FAUCITT**:\n- Company founder and owner\n- Took legitimate director's loan\n- Was protecting company by paying creditors personally\n\n### 5. Debunking False Accusations\n\n**FALSE CLAIM**: \"Jacqui gave R500,000 to Daniel\"\n**TRUTH**: Daniel took a director's loan from his own company\n\n**FALSE CLAIM**: \"The R500,000 was unauthorized\"\n**TRUTH**: Directors can legally take loans from their companies\n\n**FALSE CLAIM**: \"The R500,000 was a birthday gift\"\n**TRUTH**: It was a documented director's loan for business operations\n\n### 6. Legal and Financial Reality\n\n**Director's Loans**:\n- Legal and common business practice\n- Require proper documentation (which exists)\n- Often used for cash flow management\n- Especially necessary in emergency situations\n\n**The Emergency**:\n- FNB Cards cancelled secretly (June 7)\n- Business operations at risk\n- Creditors needed payment\n- Director stepped in with personal funds\n\n### 7. Summary of Who Did What\n\n**DANIEL FAUCITT**:\n\u2713 Took legitimate director's loan\n\u2713 Saved company from defaulting\n\u2713 Used personal funds for 6 weeks\n\u2713 Acted as responsible company owner\n\n**JACQUI FAUCITT**:\n\u2713 Not involved in finances\n\u2713 Did not give anyone money\n\u2713 Has no financial wrongdoing\n\n**RYNETTE FARRAR**:\n\u2713 Controls all ABSA accounts\n\u2713 Only person who can move money\n\u2713 Has exclusive system access\n\n**PETER FAUCITT**:\n\u2713 Has no account access\n\u2713 Cannot have stolen funds\n\u2713 Depends on Rynette for information\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe narrative that Jacqui gave Daniel R500,000 is completely false. The facts show:\n\n1. Daniel took a legitimate director's loan from his own company\n2. This was necessary due to secret card cancellations on FNB\n3. Jacqui doesn't do finance and wasn't involved\n4. Only Rynette Farrar has the ability to move money in ABSA\n5. Peter couldn't have stolen anything without account access\n\nAll accusations against Jacqui regarding this R500,000 are baseless and contradicted by documented evidence.\n\n---\n*This analysis is based solely on documented evidence and corrects misrepresentations in the case narrative.*",

Both affidavits systematically address all 100 AD paragraphs from the founding affidavit, organized into 12 logical sections. The responses expose material non-disclosures, perjury, manufactured crises, and abuse of process, while establishing grounds for a counter-application to declare Peter delinquent.\n---\n## Section 1: Applicant's Personal Details and Parties (AD 1-3.13)\n### Peter's Claims\nPeter identifies himself as a \"major businessman\" and describes the respondents, including his wife Jacqueline and son Daniel, as well as the corporate entities (RegimA Worldwide Distribution, RegimA Skin Treatments, Villa Via Arcadia, Strategic Logistics) and financial institutions involved in the matter.\n### Respondents' Position\n**Daniel's Response:** Daniel confirms the identities and registration details but denies Peter's characterization of their roles and conduct. Daniel establishes his position as sole director of multiple companies (RegimA Zone, RegimA Zone Academy, RegimA Zone Impact, ReZonance, Unicorn Dynamics) and co-director with Jacqueline of RegimA SA and RegimA Worldwide Distribution. He emphasizes that the e-commerce operations he established and managed were highly profitable, generating a combined annual revenue exceeding **R34.9 million**.\n**Jacqueline's Response:** Jacqueline confirms the identities but denies Peter's mischaracterization of their roles. She establishes her role as CEO of RegimA Skin Treatments, managing the brand successfully, while crediting Daniel and his late partner Kayla Pretorius for the growth and success of the e-commerce division.\n**Key Strategic Point:** Both respondents establish the profitability and success of the businesses under their management, directly contradicting Peter's claims of reckless or negligent conduct.\n---\n## Section 2: Accountant Details - Bantjies Conflict of Interest (AD 4)\n### Peter's Claims\nPeter identifies Danie Bantjies as \"our accountant\" who attended the office in mid-June 2025 for provisional tax and VAT submissions and subsequently noted \"numerous discrepancies\" and \"irregular payments.\"\n### Respondents' Position\n**Daniel's Response:** Daniel draws the Court's attention to a **material non-disclosure**: Peter fails to reveal that Danie Bantjies holds three conflicting roles:\n1. **Trustee** of the Faucitt Family Trust (alongside Peter)\n2. **Debtor** to the Trust\n3. **Accountant** for the companies\nThis combination creates an **impermissible conflict of interest**, constituting a breach of the fundamental fiduciary duty of loyalty.\n**Jacqueline's Response:** Jacqueline echoes Daniel's statements, emphasizing that the concealment of Bantjies's status as a Trustee prevented her from understanding the true power dynamics and the severe conflict of interest. This is a direct breach of the principles of transparency and good faith required under the **Trust Property Control Act, 57 of 1988**.\n**Key Strategic Point:** The Bantjies conflict of interest undermines the credibility of Peter's entire founding affidavit, as the alleged \"discovery\" of irregularities comes from a source with multiple undisclosed conflicts.\n---\n## Section 3: Corporate Structure (AD 6.1-6.5)\n### Peter's Claims\nPeter claims he \"caused the third to sixth respondent to be created, together with their present directors/members,\" implying ownership and control over the corporate structure.\n### Respondents' Position\n**Daniel's Response:** Daniel denies Peter's claims regarding the corporate structure and relationships. He establishes that the growth and success of the e-commerce division were driven by his late partner, Kayla Pretorius, and himself, **entirely independent of Peter's involvement or financial support**.\n**Jacqueline's Response:** Jacqueline confirms that while Peter was involved in the initial formation of the companies, the growth and success, particularly of the e-commerce division, were driven by Daniel. Her role was to manage the brand, which she did diligently.\n**Key Strategic Point:** The respondents establish that the business success is attributable to their efforts, not Peter's, undermining his claim to control and his characterization of their conduct as detrimental.\n---\n## Section 4: Urgency and Alleged Misconduct - The Manufactured Crisis (AD 7-7.20)\n### Peter's Claims\nPeter alleges that:\n- In mid-June 2025, the accountant noted discrepancies\n- He cancelled business bank cards in June 2025 and requested invoices from Daniel\n- Daniel \"adopted a 'superior' position and effectively refused to assist\"\n- Some subscriptions were halted due to card cancellations\n- Daniel interfered with staff and restricted email access\n### Respondents' Position\n**Daniel's Response:** Daniel exposes a critical **timeline manipulation**:\n- **6 June 2025:** Daniel cooperated by providing comprehensive reports to the accountant\n- **7 June 2025:** Peter unilaterally cancelled the UK business cards paying for Shopify subscriptions (cards ending 5191 and 5225) **without notice**\nThis sequence demonstrates that Peter cancelled the cards **one day after** Daniel provided the reports, not \"following\" any discovery of irregularities. The card cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible, as systems required card-based authentication. Peter then complained about missing documentation\u2014a problem he created through his own actions. This is a clear application of the legal principle ***venire contra factum proprium*** (estoppel).\nTo prevent business collapse, Daniel was compelled to substitute his personal card (1927) for RegimA SA, and Jacqueline her personal card (3212) for RegimA Zone.\n**Jacqueline's Response:** Jacqueline denies the allegations of mismanagement and provides critical context for the retaliation pattern:\n- **15 May 2025:** Jacqueline confronted Rynette Farrar about a **R1,035,000 debt** owed by RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance (Daniel's company). These funds were part of Kayla Pretorius's estate. This was an act of conscience and fulfillment of her duty under **Section 9(1) of the Trust Property Control Act**.\n- **29 May 2025:** Following the confrontation, Rynette's son's company, Adderory (Pty) Ltd, registered the competing domain `regimaskin.co.za`, suggesting reprisal.\n- **11 August 2025:** Jacqueline signed a document backdating Peter's designation as \"Main Trustee\" to 1 July 2025.\n- **13 August 2025:** Two days later, Jacqueline was included in the interdict, suggesting punishment for supporting Daniel and questioning financial conduct.\n**Key Strategic Point:** The \"manufactured crisis\" argument is the cornerstone of the defense. Peter created the problem he complains about, demonstrating bad faith and abuse of process. The retaliation pattern against Jacqueline for confronting Rynette about the debt is clearly established.\n---\n## Section 5: Financial Discrepancies and Misconduct (AD 8.4-9.3)\n### Peter's Claims\nPeter alleges:\n- 2024 tax year IT expenses: **R6,738,007.47**\n- 2025 tax year IT expenses: **R2,116,159.47**\n- These amounts are \"almost entirely unexplainable\"\n- Many expenses are \"seemingly international\"\n- Business accounts have \"almost exceeded the yearly allowable quota for funds leaving South Africa\"\n### Respondents' Position\n**Daniel's Response:** Daniel denies any financial misconduct. The alleged \"unexplained\" costs were the **legitimate expenses of running a global e-commerce business**. Daniel then turns the tables by identifying Peter's own misconduct:\n- **14-15 February 2025:** Unauthorized transfers of **R450,000 each**, totaling **R900,000**, from RegimA SA's bank account, executed without Daniel's authority, in breach of Peter's fiduciary duties as co-director.\n- **22 May 2025:** The Shopify audit data for RegimA SA was expunged, reflecting **zero sales** for June\u2013August 2025, indicating deliberate data manipulation or deletion.\n**Jacqueline's Response:** Jacqueline confirms Daniel's refutation and emphasizes that the alleged \"unexplained\" costs were legitimate e-commerce expenses.\n**Key Strategic Point:** Peter's failure to disclose the **R34.9 million annual revenue** context makes the IT expenses appear disproportionate when they are, in fact, reasonable for a global e-commerce operation. Peter's own unauthorized R900,000 transfers and the Shopify data expungement establish his misconduct, not the respondents'.\n---\n## Section 6: Application to Declare Respondents Delinquent (AD 10.1-10.14)\n### Peter's Claims\nPeter seeks to declare Jacqueline and Daniel delinquent under **Section 162(5) of the Companies Act** or, alternatively, to place them under probation under **Section 162(7)**, alleging:\n- Gross abuse of position\n- Intentional or grossly negligent harm to the companies\n- Gross negligence, wilful misconduct, or breach of trust\n- Oppressive or unfairly prejudicial conduct\n### Respondents' Position\n**Daniel's Response:** Daniel denies acting in a delinquent, grossly negligent, or breach-of-trust manner. His actions have consistently been in the best interest of the companies he directs. He then establishes that **it is Peter who has acted in bad faith** and for an improper purpose, in breach of **Section 76(3)(b) of the Companies Act**. Peter's systematic destruction of the companies, false claims, and abuse of the court process are grounds for a declaration of delinquency under **Section 162(5)**.\n**Jacqueline's Response:** Jacqueline confirms that her actions were those of a responsible trustee and director. She echoes Daniel's position that Peter has acted in bad faith and that his conduct warrants a delinquency declaration.\n**Key Strategic Point:** The respondents establish a **counter-delinquency claim** against Peter, supported by evidence of his unauthorized transfers, card cancellation sabotage, perjury, and abuse of process.\n---\n## Section 7: UK Operations and Alleged Fraud (AD 11.2-12.4)\n### Peter's Claims\nPeter alleges:\n- RegimA UK Ltd is the \"UK head office\"\n- UK entities owe money to South African operations\n- There are \"fraud concerns\" regarding UK branch non-payment\n- Misappropriation is leading to \"insolvency risk\"\n### Respondents' Position\n**Daniel's Response:** Daniel denies Peter's claims regarding UK entities owing money to South African operations. He provides **Shopify invoice evidence** (annexures DF5\u2013DF7) demonstrating that the actual payment flow is **from the UK to South Africa**, with UK entities funding SA operations to the tune of **R84,661+ annually**. Peter's and Rynette Farrar's debt allegations are **demonstrably false**, constituting **perjury**.\n**Jacqueline's Response:** Jacqueline confirms Daniel's statements, emphasizing that Peter's claims are not supported by the operational realities of the business.\n**Key Strategic Point:** The Shopify invoice evidence directly contradicts Peter's founding affidavit, establishing perjury and material non-disclosure. This is one of the strongest pieces of evidence for setting aside the ex parte order.\n---\n## Section 8: Requirements for Interdictory Relief (AD 13.2-13.8)\n### Peter's Claims\nPeter asserts that he meets the requirements for interdictory relief:\n- Clear right not to be prejudiced\n- Injury sustained and apprehension of further harm\n- Reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm\n- Interdicts essential for corporation survival\n- Balance of convenience favors granting relief\n### Respondents' Position\n**Daniel's Response:** Daniel denies that Peter has met **any** of the requirements for interdictory relief:\n- Peter has **no clear right** (he manufactured the crisis)\n- Peter has suffered **no harm that he did not inflict upon himself** (card cancellation)\n- Peter had **alternative remedies available** to him as a trustee (could have used trust powers)\n- The **balance of convenience overwhelmingly favors** setting aside the order\n**Jacqueline's Response:** Jacqueline confirms that the balance of convenience overwhelmingly favors setting aside the order.\n**Key Strategic Point:** The respondents systematically dismantle each requirement for interdictory relief, establishing that the ex parte order was improperly granted.\n---\n## Section 9: Financial Constraints and Forensic Audit (AD 14.1-14.5)\n### Peter's Claims\nPeter seeks:\n- Financial constraints on the respondents\n- Constraint to prevent financial prejudice\n- Forensic audit necessity and remuneration\n- Relief under Part B\n### Respondents' Position\n**Daniel's Response:** Daniel denies the necessity of the constraints sought by Peter. However, he **supports the necessity of a forensic audit**, provided it is conducted by an **independent and impartial party**, to fully expose the financial misconduct and conflicts of interest detailed in the affidavit.\n**Jacqueline's Response:** Jacqueline echoes Daniel's position, supporting an independent forensic audit.\n**Key Strategic Point:** The respondents' willingness to support an independent forensic audit demonstrates confidence in their position and turns Peter's request into an opportunity to expose his own misconduct.\n---\n## Section 10: Discovery and Urgency (AD 16.1-16.12)\n### Peter's Claims\nPeter alleges:\n- Discovery of respondents' conduct in mid-June 2025\n- R600,000 transfer (later corrected to R500,000) as trigger for action\n- Unawareness of urgent application process\n- State of shock and delayed response\n- Attorney consultation timeline\n- Need for urgent court assistance\n### Respondents' Position\n**Daniel's Response:** Daniel denies Peter's claims regarding the discovery of his conduct and the urgency of the matter. Peter's **delay in bringing this application**, despite claiming knowledge of the alleged issues since mid-June 2025, **contradicts his claim of urgency**. The R600,000 transfer (actually R500,000) is a **pretext** for an action motivated by Peter's desire to seize control of the businesses.\n**Jacqueline's Response:** Jacqueline confirms that Peter's delay contradicts his claim of urgency.\n**Key Strategic Point:** The delay between the alleged discovery (mid-June) and the application (August) undermines Peter's urgency claim, suggesting the application is motivated by other factors (retaliation).\n---\n## Section 11: Ex Parte Basis (AD 17.3-17.4)\n### Peter's Claims\nPeter asserts:\n- Ex parte basis for application\n- Urgency justifies ex parte relief\n### Respondents' Position\n**Daniel's Response:** Daniel denies that the urgency justifies the ex parte relief granted. Peter's **material non-disclosures** and **manufactured crisis** demonstrate an **abuse of the ex parte process**.\n**Jacqueline's Response:** Jacqueline confirms that Peter's material non-disclosures and manufactured crisis demonstrate abuse of the ex parte process.\n**Key Strategic Point:** The ex parte order was obtained through material non-disclosures (Bantjies conflict, timeline manipulation, UK funding perjury), constituting abuse of process and grounds for setting aside the order.\n---\n## Section 12: Remaining Paragraphs (AD 18.3, 20, 22, 40.9.4, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, 88)\n### Peter's Claims\nVarious administrative and procedural paragraphs, including:\n- Continual unauthorized fund transfers\n- First and second respondent details\n- Additional party information\n- Gross abuse of director/member position\n- Applicant identity details\n- Registered address details\n- Timeline context\n- Accountant's office visit and discovery\n- Irregular payments discovery\n- Follow-up actions\n### Respondents' Position\n**Daniel's Response:** Daniel denies the allegations contained in the remaining paragraphs and puts Peter to the proof thereof.\n**Jacqueline's Response:** Jacqueline confirms Daniel's position.\n**Key Strategic Point:** The respondents maintain a comprehensive denial of all remaining allegations, requiring Peter to prove his claims.\n---\n## Conclusion and Prayer\nBoth respondents characterize Peter's application as a **personal vendetta masquerading as a legitimate legal dispute**. They assert that Peter has abused his position as a director and trustee to punish his family and seize control of assets he did not build. They pray that the Court will see through this charade and grant the relief sought in their counter-application, with costs to be paid by Peter on an attorney and own client scale.\n---\n## Strategic Strengths of the Answering Affidavits\n### 1. Manufactured Crisis Argument\nThe affidavits effectively demonstrate that Peter created the crisis he complains about through his card cancellation on 7 June 2025, one day after Daniel provided comprehensive reports. This establishes bad faith and the application of *venire contra factum proprium* (estoppel).\n### 2. Material Non-Disclosures\nThe affidavits expose multiple material non-disclosures in Peter's founding affidavit:\n- Bantjies's triple role (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant)\n- Timeline manipulation (card cancellation before alleged discovery)\n- UK funding perjury (claiming UK owes SA when the opposite is true)\n- Revenue context omission (R34.9M annual revenue)\n### 3. Perjury Exposure\nThe Shopify invoice evidence directly contradicts Peter's claims about UK operations, establishing perjury and undermining the credibility of the entire founding affidavit.\n### 4. Retaliation Pattern\nThe affidavits establish a clear retaliation pattern:\n- Against Jacqueline for confronting Rynette about the R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025)\n- Against Daniel for exposing fraud to Bantjies (6 June 2025)\n- Competing domain registration by Adderory (29 May 2025)\n- Jacqueline's inclusion in the interdict two days after signing the \"Main Trustee\" document (13 August 2025)\n### 5. Counter-Delinquency Grounds\nThe affidavits establish grounds for a counter-application to declare Peter delinquent based on:\n- Unauthorized R900,000 transfers (14-15 February 2025)\n- Card cancellation sabotage (7 June 2025)\n- Perjury in founding affidavit (UK funding claims)\n- Abuse of court process (ex parte order based on material non-disclosures)\n- Shopify data expungement (22 May 2025)\n### 6. Balance of Convenience\nThe affidavits demonstrate that the balance of convenience overwhelmingly favors setting aside the ex parte order, as:\n- Peter manufactured the crisis\n- Peter has alternative remedies as a trustee\n- The respondents' exclusion harms the profitable businesses\n- An independent forensic audit would expose Peter's misconduct\n---\n## Recommendations\n1. **Proceed with Counter-Application:** The affidavits provide a strong foundation for a counter-application to declare Peter delinquent under Section 162(5) of the Companies Act.\n2. **Emphasize Independent Forensic Audit:** The respondents' support for an independent forensic audit demonstrates confidence and turns Peter's request into an opportunity to expose his misconduct.\n3. **Highlight Retaliation Pattern:** The timeline of events (Jacqueline's confrontation on 15 May, competing domain registration on 29 May, Jacqueline's inclusion in the interdict on 13 August) establishes a clear pattern of retaliation.\n4. **Leverage Shopify Invoice Evidence:** The Shopify invoices are the strongest piece of evidence for establishing perjury and should be prominently featured in court submissions.\n5. **Apply *Venire Contra Factum Proprium*:** The manufactured crisis argument, grounded in the legal principle of estoppel, is a powerful defense against Peter's urgency claims.",

manufactured crisis\n- Section 76(3)(b) of Companies Act - bad faith and improper purpose\n- Section 162(5) of Companies Act - grounds for Peter's delinquency\n- Section 9(1) of Trust Property Control Act - trustee duties\n- Requirements for interdictory relief (clear right, harm, balance of convenience)\n### Strategic Recommendations\n- Emphasize manufactured crisis argument\n- Highlight retaliation pattern\n- Leverage Shopify invoice evidence for perjury\n- Support independent forensic audit\n- Pursue counter-application for Peter's delinquency\n---\n**Template Created:** November 1, 2025  \n**Repository:** cogpy/canima  \n**Purpose:** Workspace for detailed AD paragraph analysis and commentary",

INTRODUCTION AND CAPACITY\n1.1 I am JACQUELINE FAUCITT, a major businesswoman with identity number 570607 0898 18 1, resident at 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview.\n1.2 The facts herein contained fall within my personal knowledge, unless otherwise stated, and are true and correct.\n1.3 I am a co-trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust and co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd.\n________________________________\n2. PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT\n2.1 I am the First Respondent in this matter.\n2.2 I have been personally involved with the subject matter and can confirm the contents are within my personal knowledge.\n2.3 Legal submissions are made on advice of my legal representatives.\n2.4 Annexures must be read as incorporated herein.\n________________________________\n\n3. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 3.1-3.13: PARTIES AND STRUCTURE\n3.1 The Applicant's identification is noted.\n3.2 I confirm my identity as stated by the Applicant.\n3.3 The Second Respondent's identity is noted.\n3.4 RegimA Skin Treatments CC is correctly identified. I note that this entity owes R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, part of Kayla Pretorius's deceased estate, since February 2023.\n3.5 RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd is correctly identified. This entity is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust.\n3.6 Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC is correctly identified. This entity is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust and extracts an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group.\n3.7 Strategic Logistics CC is correctly identified. This entity recorded a R5.4 million stock adjustment in 2024, representing 46% of its annual sales.\n3.8 FNB is correctly identified. R900,000 was transferred from RegimA SA's FNB account without my authority as co-director on 14-15 February 2025.\n3.9 ABSA Bank is correctly identified. Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution began with an ABSA bank letter dated 14 April 2025.\n3.10 CIPC is correctly identified.\n3.11 The Applicant's statement that no relief is sought from the 3rd-9th respondents is noted.\n3.12 The Applicant's convenience references are noted.\n3.13 The Applicant's identity confirmation is noted. The commissioning of the affidavit by Mr. Bantjies, an undisclosed trustee and debtor to the Applicant (R18.685M), constitutes a material non-disclosure.\n________________________________\n\n4. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTANT'S CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n4.1 The Applicant identifies Mr. Danie Bantjies as his accountant. The Applicant fails to disclose material facts:\n4.1.1 **Trustee:** Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, concealed from beneficiaries.\n4.1.2 **Debtor:** Mr. Bantjies owes the Applicant R18.685 million (Annexure SF1).\n4.1.3 **Company Controller:** Mr. Bantjies was \"running the companies\" when fraud was reported.\n4.1.4 **Obstruction:** Mr. Bantjies dismissed the audit request on 10 June 2025.\n4.2 This confluence creates an irreconcilable conflict of interest, invalidating any claim of impartial investigation.\n________________________________\n\n5. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1-6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE\n5.1 The Applicant misrepresents the operational control structure. Evidence shows Ms. Farrar controlled all bank accounts and the Sage system.\n5.2 As co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd, I confirm that R900,000 was transferred without my authority on 14-15 February 2025.\n5.3 The Applicant's description of banking arrangements omits systematic revenue diversion orchestrated by his agents.\n________________________________\n6. JURISDICTION AND LOCUS STANDI\n6.1 The Court's jurisdiction is not disputed.\n6.2 The Applicant's locus standi is noted, subject to the material non-disclosures and conflicts of interest detailed herein.\n________________________________\n\n7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7.1-7.20: DISCOVERY OF FINANCIAL IRREGULARITIES\nJR 7.1 I deny the Applicant's claim that his accountant, Mr. Danie Bantjies, attended the office in mid-June 2025 for provisional tax and VAT submissions. The Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025, exposing the fraud involving Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC's excessive profit extraction (86% margin on rent). Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust, a fact concealed from the beneficiaries, and owes the Applicant R18.685 million (Annexure SF1).\nJR 7.2 The Applicant's claim that Mr. Bantjies \"noted discrepancies\" in July 2025 is a misrepresentation. The discrepancies were reported to Mr. Bantjies by the Second Respondent on 6 June 2025. The very next day, 7 June 2025, the Applicant cancelled 15 business credit cards (Annexure DF4), demonstrating consciousness of guilt and retaliation for the exposure of fraud.\nJR 7.3 The Applicant mischaracterizes legitimate IT expenses as \"irregular payments.\" These expenses relate to the 51 Shopify stores and associated software infrastructure required to generate R34.9 million in annual revenue. The true irregularities are: (1) R5.4 million stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics CC (46% of annual sales); (2) R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA; (3) Villa Via's 86% profit margin on rent.\nJR 7.4 The Applicant's characterization of the Second Respondent's conduct as \"increasingly erratic\" is unfounded and defamatory. The Second Respondent was managing a profitable global e-commerce operation generating R34.9 million annually. His conduct was professional and transparent, as evidenced by his provision of comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025.\nJR 7.5.1 The Applicant's claim that payments \"could not be explained\" is false. The Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025, including detailed financial analysis and evidence of fraud.\nJR 7.5.2 The Applicant cancelled 15 business credit cards on 7 June 2025, one day after receiving the Second Respondent's reports. This timing demonstrates a manufactured crisis and application of the doctrine of venire contra factum proprium (estoppel). The Applicant cannot complain of a situation he deliberately created.\nJR 7.5.3 The Applicant cancelled his own card \"for the sake thereof,\" suggesting awareness that the card cancellations were punitive rather than protective.\nJR 7.6 The Applicant's claim that \"the majority of the transactions remain unexplained\" is contradicted by the comprehensive reports provided on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's refusal to accept these explanations was part of the retaliation strategy.\nJR 7.7 I confirm that the Applicant's card cancellations on 7 June 2025 caused service interruptions, including the halting of internet domains and essential business subscriptions. This was the direct and foreseeable consequence of the Applicant's own actions.\nJR 7.8 The Applicant's allegation that the Second Respondent \"adopted a 'superior' position and effectively refused to assist\" is false. The Second Respondent had already provided comprehensive assistance on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's characterization is an attempt to justify his retaliatory conduct.\nJR 7.9 The inter-office communications referenced by the Applicant (Annexure PF7) demonstrate the Second Respondent's professionalism and the Applicant's unreasonable demands following the card cancellations.\nJR 7.10 The Applicant's communications were with the Second Respondent's personal assistant because the Applicant had already cancelled the business credit cards, creating a crisis that required immediate attention.\nJR 7.11 The Applicant's claim that the Second Respondent \"would or could not provide relevant invoices\" is contradicted by the comprehensive reports provided on 6 June 2025, which included detailed financial documentation.\nJR 7.12 The Applicant's allegation that the Second Respondent \"interfered with the corporations' staff doing their jobs\" is an inversion of the facts. The interference came from the Applicant and his agents, who:\n*\t\n\tCancelled 15 business credit cards (7 June 2025)\n*\t\n\tRevoked the Second Respondent's email access (retaliation for reporting fraud)\n*\t\n\tDiverted company revenue to competing entities owned by Ms. Farrar's son\n*\t\n\tExpunged Shopify audit data (22 May 2025)\nJR 7.13.1 The Applicant's claim regarding email access is misleading. The Second Respondent's access to email and accounting systems was revoked in retaliation for exposing financial misconduct on 6 June 2025.\nJR 7.13.2 The selective restoration of email access \"on an ad hoc basis\" was controlled by Ms. Farrar, who had control of the Applicant's email address (pete@regima.com <mailto:pete@regima.com> ) and all company systems (Annexures SF2, SF4).\nJR 7.14 The \"continued interference\" referenced by the Applicant was the systematic sabotage orchestrated by the Applicant's agents, including:\n*\t\n\tRevenue diversion from RegimA SA (from 1 March 2025)\n*\t\n\tRevenue diversion from RegimA Worldwide Distribution (from 14 April 2025, Annexure DF12)\n*\t\n\tCustomer diversion to regimaskin.co.za, owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure JF8)\n*\t\n\tWarehouse sabotage (July 2025, Annexure DF13)\nJR 7.15 The conduct \"not in the interests of the corporations\" was the Applicant's systematic dismantling of a profitable R34.9 million operation in retaliation for the Second Respondent's exposure of fraud.\nJR 7.16.1 I confirm that I approached the banks (FNB and ABSA) to obtain duplicate cards on or about 24 June 2025. This action was necessary to prevent the total collapse of the business operations following the Applicant's punitive card cancellations on 7 June 2025.\nJR 7.16.2 The use of personal credit cards to maintain business operations demonstrates the Applicant's bad faith and the manufactured nature of the crisis.\nJR 7.17.1 The Applicant's claim that I \"rejected any idea of malfeasance or neglect on our son's part\" is false. I defended the Second Respondent because he had acted professionally and transparently, providing comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025.\nJR 7.17.2 The Applicant's characterization of my response as \"I will show you\" is a misrepresentation designed to portray me as defiant rather than protective of legitimate business interests.\nJR 7.18.1 I deny transferring R500,000 to the Second Respondent on or about 16 July 2025 as a \"birthday gift.\" This allegation is false and unsupported by evidence.\nJR 7.18.2 The Applicant's claim that I have \"no other sources of income other than remuneration by the third to sixth respondents\" is irrelevant to the allegations and appears designed to undermine my financial independence.\nJR 7.18.3 If any transfer occurred on 16 July 2025, it would have been a legitimate business transaction, not a personal gift. The Applicant provides no evidence (bank statements, invoices, or transfer documentation) to support this allegation.\nJR 7.19 I deny that any transfer was made \"without the Applicant's knowledge.\" As the sole trustee with absolute powers over the Faucitt Family Trust (which owns RegimA Worldwide and Villa Via), and with Ms. Farrar controlling all bank accounts under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, the Applicant had full visibility of all financial transactions.\nJR 7.20 The Applicant's claim that any alleged transfer was \"separate to remuneration as director/member\" is speculative and unsupported. The Second Respondent's remuneration structure included performance-based compensation for managing the R34.9 million e-commerce operation.\n________________________________\n\n8. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 8.1-8.10: IT EXPENSES ANALYSIS\nJR 8.1 The Applicant's claims regarding IT expenses must be viewed in the context of a R34.9 million global e-commerce operation. This operation requires a sophisticated and robust IT infrastructure, which the Second Respondent built and managed.\nJR 8.2 The expense categories referenced by the Applicant are standard for a global e-commerce business. This includes 51 Shopify stores, associated software licenses, payment gateways, and marketing platforms.\nJR 8.3 The expense amounts are proportional to the revenue generated. The IT infrastructure was essential to achieving R34.9 million in annual sales.\nJR 8.4 The Applicant misrepresents the timeline of discovery. The Second Respondent discovered and reported the discrepancies to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025. The Applicant's alleged \"discovery\" in mid-June was a pretext for retaliation.\nJR 8.5 The investigation was conducted by the conflicted Mr. Bantjies, who had a direct financial interest in concealing the fraud he was involved in. This invalidates any claim of an impartial investigation.\nJR 8.6 The IT vendors referenced are legitimate and well-known providers of e-commerce services, including Shopify, Google, and various software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms.\nJR 8.7 The Applicant's claim that IT expenses were \"unexplained\" is false. The Second Respondent provided comprehensive documentation to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025.\nJR 8.8 International payments are a standard and necessary part of a global e-commerce business with customers and suppliers in multiple countries.\nJR 8.9 The bank messages regarding foreign exchange limits are standard notifications and not evidence of misconduct. They are a routine part of international transactions.\nJR 8.10 The true financial irregularities are not the legitimate IT expenses, but the R5.4 million stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics CC, the R900,000 in unauthorized transfers, and the 86% profit extraction by Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC.\n________________________________\n\n9. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 9.1-9.4: FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT SUMMARY\nJR 9.1 The Applicant's summary of financial misconduct is an inversion of the facts, designed to deflect from the actual fraud schemes.\nJR 9.2 The bank message regarding foreign exchange limits is a standard notification, not evidence of misconduct. It is a routine part of international business.\nJR 9.3 The Applicant's summary of \"unexplained expenses\" is a mischaracterization of legitimate IT costs. The actual misconduct includes:\n**JR 9.3.1** The **R5.4 million stock adjustment** in Strategic Logistics CC, representing 46% of annual sales.\n**JR 9.3.2** The **R900,000 in unauthorized transfers** from RegimA SA's FNB account.\n**JR 9.3.3** The **86% profit margin on rent** charged by Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC.\nJR 9.4 The total financial impact of the Applicant's and his agents' misconduct is substantial and includes:\n**JR 9.4.1** The **R5.4 million** stock loss in Strategic Logistics CC.\n**JR 9.4.2** The **R900,000** in unauthorized transfers.\n**JR 9.4.3** The **R1,035,000** debt owed to Kayla Pretorius's deceased estate.\n**JR 9.4.4** The ongoing revenue diversion to competing entities.\n________________________________\n\n10. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1-10.13: DELINQUENCY ALLEGATIONS\nJR 10.1 The Applicant's request to have the Second Respondent and me declared delinquent is an abuse of process. Our actions were consistent with our fiduciary duties. It is the Applicant's own conduct that warrants a delinquency declaration under Section 162(5)(c) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008.\nJR 10.2 The Applicant has: (i) grossly abused his position as a director and trustee; (ii) intentionally or by gross negligence inflicted harm upon the companies; and (iii) acted in a manner that constitutes gross negligence, wilful misconduct, and a breach of trust.\nJR 10.3 The Applicant acted in bad faith and for an improper purpose, in contravention of Section 76(3)(b) of the Companies Act, by manufacturing a crisis to conceal the financial misconduct we had exposed.\nJR 10.4 The Applicant's reliance on the Close Corporations Act is noted. The provisions of this Act, particularly regarding gross negligence and fraud, apply to the Applicant's own conduct.\nJR 10.5 The Applicant's definition of delinquency is noted. The Applicant's conduct meets this definition.\nJR 10.6 The Applicant's definition of probation is noted. The Applicant's conduct meets this definition.\nJR 10.7 The Applicant invokes breach of fiduciary duty liability. The breaches are established: (1) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to the Second Respondent (co-director) by unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries (as trustee) by attacking them with interdict; (3) Mr. Bantjies breached fiduciary duty to beneficiaries by dismissing audit request and facilitating fraud.\nJR 10.7.1.1 The Applicant cites liability for loss suffered by corporation. The losses include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) Revenue diversion to competing domain; (4) Card cancellation sabotage; (5) Data expungement.\nJR 10.7.1.2 The Applicant cites liability for economic benefit. The economic benefits derived include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (4) 86% profit margin on Villa Via rent; (5) Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za (Adderory).\nJR 10.8 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act Section 47 disqualification. This section applies when a member is guilty of gross negligence or fraud. The R5.4M stock adjustment (46% of sales, 10x historical) in Strategic Logistics, with Ms. Farrar claiming Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments, and the same stock type supplied by Adderory, suggests systematic fraud.\nJR 10.9 The Applicant invokes Section 162(5) mandatory disqualification grounds. These grounds apply to the Applicant's conduct: (1) Intentional harm to companies (R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage); (2) Grossly negligent harm (card cancellation rendering documentation inaccessible); (3) Breach of trust (trustee attacking beneficiaries).\nJR 10.9.1 The Applicant's reliance on Section 162(5)(a) is noted. This ground applies to the Applicant.\nJR 10.9.2 The Applicant alleges intentional or grossly negligent harm by respondents. The intentional harm was inflicted by the Applicant and his co-conspirators: (1) 6 June: Second Respondent cooperates; (2) 7 June: Cards cancelled; (3) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days after my inquiry); (4) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days after my inquiry); (5) 8 July: Warehouse sabotaged; (6) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action followed either my debt inquiry or the Second Respondent's fraud exposure.\nJR 10.9.3 The Applicant alleges gross negligence or misconduct. The gross negligence is demonstrated by: Cancelling 15 business cards without notice, rendering documentation inaccessible, then complaining about missing documentation. This demonstrates consciousness of guilt and bad faith.\nJR 10.9.3.1 The Applicant alleges wilful misconduct. The wilful misconduct includes: (1) Systematic revenue diversion (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (2) Data destruction (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) Card sabotage (7 June); (5) Warehouse sabotage (8 July); (6) Account emptying (11 Sep). This six-month campaign occurred after I investigated fraud and the Second Respondent exposed fraud.\nJR 10.9.3.2 The Applicant alleges acquiescence to fraud. The acquiescence to fraud includes: (1) Two years of unallocated expenses while Ms. Farrar controlled systems using the Applicant's email and Linda was employed as bookkeeper; (2) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\" with Mr. Bantjies allegedly instructing payments; (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate unpaid since Feb 2023; (4) Villa Via 86% profit margin rent extraction.\nJR 10.9.3.3 The Applicant alleges omission with fraudulent purpose. The omissions with fraudulent purpose include: (1) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's trustee status from affidavit; (2) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Applicant omitted R34.9M revenue context for IT expenses; (4) Applicant omitted UK \u2192 SA payment flow (claimed opposite); (5) Applicant omitted timeline showing card cancellation day after Second Respondent's cooperation; (6) Applicant omitted my debt inquiry and subsequent retaliation.\nJR 10.10 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162(7). This section applies when conduct is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) I fulfilled fiduciary duty by investigating debt, then was punished with interdict; (2) Second Respondent exposed fraud to accountant, then suffered six-month sabotage campaign; (3) Both excluded from profitable businesses we built.\nJR 10.10.1 The Applicant alleges conduct inconsistent with duties. The conduct inconsistent with duties includes: (1) Trustee attacking beneficiaries (Applicant, Mr. Bantjies); (2) Director making unauthorized transfers (Applicant); (3) Trustee dismissing fraud investigation (Mr. Bantjies); (4) Accountant facilitating fraud while being debtor (Mr. Bantjies); (5) Administrator controlling systems while diverting revenue (Ms. Farrar).\nJR 10.10.2 The Applicant invokes Section 162(a)(iii) grounds for probation.\nJR 10.10.2.1 The Applicant alleges conduct with prejudicial result. The prejudicial results include: (1) I was excluded from companies after investigating fraud; (2) Second Respondent excluded from R34.9M operations he built; (3) Customers diverted to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son; (4) R900K transferred without authorization; (5) R5.4M stock \"disappeared\"; (6) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate unpaid.\nJR 10.10.2.2 The Applicant alleges oppressive business conduct. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled all systems using Applicant's email while claiming to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions; (2) Applicant had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems; (3) Two years of expenses unallocated despite employed bookkeeper; (4) Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) dismissed fraud investigation.\nJR 10.10.2.3 The Applicant alleges oppressive exercise of powers. The oppressive exercise of powers includes: (1) Applicant used trustee powers to attack beneficiaries; (2) Mr. Bantjies used trustee powers to dismiss audit request and facilitate fraud; (3) Applicant used director powers to make unauthorized R900K transfers; (4) Applicant used court process to obtain ex parte order based on material non-disclosures.\nJR 10.11 The Applicant's requested remedies are inappropriate. The appropriate remedy is a full, independent forensic audit.\nJR 10.12 The Court's discretion should be exercised against the Applicant due to his abuse of process and material non-disclosures.\nJR 10.13 The Applicant alleges unaccounted money. The unaccounted money includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) R5.4 million stock \"disappeared\" from Strategic Logistics; (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023; (4) R1.73 million transferred 11 Sep 2025; (5) Two years of unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide on 30 Mar 2025.\n________________________________\n\n11. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 11.1-11.9: UK OPERATIONS\nJR 11.1 The Applicant's statement that \"we also began companies in the United Kingdom\" is misleading. The UK e-commerce operations were built and funded by RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009), which is owned and operated by the Second Respondent.\nJR 11.2 The Applicant's claim that these companies \"fall under the UK head office, being RegimA UK Ltd\" is false. RegimA Zone Ltd is an independent entity, not under RegimA UK Ltd.\nJR 11.3 The Applicant's statement regarding directors is noted. The operational control and funding of RegimA Zone Ltd rests with the Second Respondent.\nJR 11.4 The Applicant's claim of \"minimal involvement\" is accurate. The Applicant had no operational involvement in the UK e-commerce operations built by the Second Respondent.\nJR 11.5 The Applicant's statement that the Second Respondent \"was appointed to oversee the UK branch\" is misleading. The Second Respondent built and owns RegimA Zone Ltd independently.\nJR 11.6 The Applicant's claim that \"the third to sixth respondents ship to the UK branch, but do not receive payment therefrom\" is a complete inversion of the facts. UK bank records show that RegimA Zone Ltd continuously paid for the South African Shopify platforms (Annexure DF8). This directly contradicts the Applicant's perjurious claims that the UK entities were indebted to the SA companies.\nJR 11.7 The Applicant's reference to Isaac Chesno and alleged fraud is irrelevant to the current matter and appears designed to create a false narrative of UK financial problems.\nJR 11.8 The Applicant's statement that he fears \"the continued non-payment (from the UK branch) may inter alia be a ruse\" is contradicted by bank records showing continuous UK \u2192 SA payments (Annexure DF8).\nJR 11.9 The Applicant's claim that he has \"no idea pertaining to the financial wellness of the UK branches\" is inconsistent with his role as trustee with absolute powers. This statement appears designed to create a pretext for further interference with the Second Respondent's UK operations.\n________________________________\n\n12. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 12.1-12.4: NECESSITY OF RELIEF\n12.1 The Applicant has failed to establish necessity for the relief sought.\n12.2 The Applicant created the crisis he now complains about through card cancellations on 7 June 2025.\n12.3 The Applicant has alternative remedies available, including his absolute powers as trustee.\n12.4 The relief sought is disproportionate and punitive rather than protective.\n________________________________\n\n13. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 13.1-13.7: INTERDICTORY RELIEF\n13.1 The Applicant has failed to establish the requirements for interdictory relief.\n13.2 The Applicant has no clear right. The alleged misconduct is contradicted by evidence.\n13.3 The Applicant has failed to establish irreparable harm. The harm was self-inflicted.\n13.4 The Applicant has alternative remedies, including his trustee powers.\n13.5 The balance of convenience favors the Respondents. The interdict would destroy a R34.9M operation.\n13.6 The Applicant's delay undermines the urgency claim.\n13.7 The relief sought under Part A is unjustified and should be refused.\n________________________________\n\n14. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1-14.5: FORENSIC AUDIT AND OTHER RELIEF\n14.1 The Applicant seeks a forensic audit. This is disingenuous given Mr. Bantjies's conflict of interest.\n14.2 Any forensic audit must be conducted by an independent auditor, not one selected by the conflicted Applicant.\n14.3 The audit must include Villa Via's 86% profit margin, the R5.4M stock adjustment, and Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt.\n14.4 The costs of any audit should be borne by the Applicant, who created this crisis.\n14.5 Other relief sought is opposed for reasons stated herein.\n________________________________\n\n15. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1-16.12: URGENCY\n15.1 The Applicant's urgency claim is contradicted by the two-month delay between alleged discovery (mid-June) and application (August).\n15.2 The Applicant created the urgency through card cancellations on 7 June 2025.\n15.3 The doctrine of venire contra factum proprium (estoppel) applies. The Applicant cannot complain of a situation he created.\n15.4 The true motivation was retaliation against the Second Respondent and me for exposing financial misconduct.\n15.5 The Applicant's claim of being in a \"state of shock\" is disingenuous, as the evidence reveals a premeditated campaign.\n________________________________\n\n16. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 17.1-17.4: EX PARTE BASIS\n16.1 The Applicant's ex parte application was improper and based on material non-disclosures.\n16.2 The Applicant failed to disclose Mr. Bantjies's triple conflict (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant).\n16.3 The Applicant failed to disclose the timeline showing retaliation (reports 6 June \u2192 cards cancelled 7 June).\n16.4 The ex parte order should be set aside due to material non-disclosures and false statements.\n________________________________\n\n17. RESPONSE TO REMAINING PARAGRAPHS\n17.1 The Applicant's remaining allegations are a continuation of the same pattern of misrepresentation and non-disclosure.\n17.2 The evidence demonstrates that the unauthorized transfers, financial irregularities, and operational sabotage were all orchestrated by the Applicant and his agents in retaliation for our attempts to expose their misconduct.\n________________________________\n\n18. PRAYER\nWHEREFORE I pray for an order in the following terms:\n1.\tThat the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025 be set aside.\n2.\tThat the Applicant's application be dismissed with costs on an attorney and client scale.\n3.\tThat the Applicant be declared a delinquent director in terms of Section 162(5) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008.\n4.\tThat an independent forensic auditor be appointed to investigate the financial affairs of the companies and the conduct of the Applicant and his agents.\n5.\tFurther and/or alternative relief.\n________________________________\nJACQUELINE FAUCITT\nFirst Respondent\nDate: November 2, 2025\n________________________________\nEND OF AFFIDAVIT",

Contempt of Court\n*\tViolating/exceeding a court order\n*\tCriminal offense (imprisonment possible)\n*\tCourt can issue warrant for arrest\n*\tFines and penalties apply\n2. Personal Liability\n*\tActs outside authority = personal responsibility\n*\tNo protection from court order\n*\tCan be sued personally for damages\n*\tPiercing corporate veil possible\n3. Invalid Actions\n*\tDecisions beyond authority are void\n*\tContracts signed ultra vires unenforceable\n*\tActions can be reversed\n*\tNo legal effect\nStrategic Consequences:\n4. Grounds for Rescission\n*\tShows bad faith\n*\tAbuse of court process\n*\tJustifies setting aside order\n*\tEvidence of fraudulent intent\n5. Criminal Charges\n*\tFraud (misusing court order)\n*\tAssault (phone grabbing)\n*\tObstruction of justice\n*\tIntimidation\nPractical Effects:\n6. Loss of Court Protection\n*\tCan't rely on order he violated\n*\t\"Unclean hands\" doctrine applies\n*\tCourt unlikely to assist him further\n*\tEnforcement becomes impossible\n7. Evidence of Broader Fraud\n*\tShows interdict obtained for improper purpose\n*\tProves never intended to comply\n*\tPattern of abuse established\n*\tStrengthens fraud arguments\nYour Remedies:\nUrgent Court Application:\n*\tReport contempt to court\n*\tSeek his removal from control\n*\tRequest punitive costs\n*\tApply for rescission\nCriminal Complaint:\n*\tHawks/police for contempt\n*\tAssault charges for phone incident\n*\tObstruction charges\nCivil Claims:\n*\tDamages for harm caused\n*\tPersonal liability claims\n*\tDelictual action\nThe \"Control All Companies\" Statement:\nThis is particularly damaging because:\n*\tAdmission against interest - proves exceeded authority\n*\tShows criminal intent - knew he was exceeding\n*\tWitnesses heard it - employee present\n*\tContradicts interdict - financial only, not total\nLegal Doctrine Applied:\nFunctus Officio:\n*\tOnce exceeded, authority ends\n*\tCan't pick and choose compliance\n*\tAll or nothing with court orders\nEx Turpi Causa:\n*\tCan't benefit from own wrongdoing\n*\tViolation prevents enforcement\n*\tUnclean hands bar relief\nWhat Courts Do:\nWhen someone exceeds an interdict:\n1.\tImmediate: Can issue contempt proceedings\n2.\tSanctions: Fines, imprisonment, costs\n3.\tReversal: Undo unauthorized acts\n4.\tRescission: Set aside abused order\n5.\tBar: Prevent future applications\nBottom Line\nPeter exceeding the interdict is legally catastrophic for him:\n*\tCriminally: Contempt charges possible\n*\tCivilly: Personal liability attaches\n*\tStrategically: Loses ability to enforce\n*\tEvidentially: Proves bad faith\nFor you, it:\n*\tProvides grounds for immediate rescission\n*\tJustifies urgent court intervention\n*\tCreates personal claims against him\n*\tProves the settlement was obtained fraudulently\nA party who violates their own court order cannot enforce it against others. Peter's claim of total control when he only had financial authority, combined with preventing legal compliance and assaulting an employee, transforms him from protected applicant to potential criminal defendant.\nThe court that granted the order would be particularly offended by someone using their authority to exceed what was granted and commit crimes.",

I'm preventing us from legitimizing a criminal fraud by treating it as valid.\nTo the best of my understanding, the law is clear - fraud vitiates everything.\nCan we please focus on the rescission application based on proven perjury rather than responding to disputes in a criminally void document?\n\nWarm Regards,\nDan\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPLEASE SEE ADDENDA BELOW RELATING TO MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE SITUATION AND Rule 6(12)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou cannot answer \"disputes\" in a document obtained by perjury - doing so validates the crime.\nThe strategy must be:\n1.      Attack the legitimacy (void ab initio)\n2.      Prove the perjury (criminal evidence)\n3.      Refuse engagement (no Part B response)\n4.      Criminal referral (not civil litigation)\nThis isn't stubbornness - it's correct legal strategy when dealing with criminally fraudulent proceedings.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUrgent Applications and the Interpretation of Rule 6(12) in South African Courts\n\nUrgent applications are a critical component of South African civil procedure, enabling litigants to approach the courts for immediate relief in circumstances where the ordinary procedural timelines would render justice ineffective or moot. Rule 6(12) of the Uniform Rules of Court governs the procedure for bringing such applications, and its interpretation by the courts reflects a careful balancing of the right to urgent relief and the need to prevent abuse of process.\nRule 6(12) provides as follows:\n\"(a) In urgent applications the court or a judge may dispense with the forms and service provided for in these rules and may dispose of such matter at such time and place and in such manner and in accordance with such procedure (which shall as far as practicable be in terms of these rules) as it deems fit.\n(b) In every affidavit filed in support of any application under paragraph (a) of this subrule, the applicant shall set forth explicitly the circumstances which he avers render the matter urgent and the reasons why he claims that he could not be afforded substantial redress at a hearing in due course.\"\n\nKey Elements of Rule 6(12)\nThere are two key elements that an applicant must satisfy for an urgent application to be entertained:\n1.      Urgency: The applicant must demonstrate that the matter is genuinely urgent.\n2.      Lack of Substantial Redress: The applicant must show that he or she will not obtain substantial redress in due course if the matter were to proceed in the ordinary way.\nCourts require these elements to be clearly and explicitly set out in the founding affidavit. The mere assertion of urgency, or inconvenience caused by delay, is not sufficient.\n\nJudicial Interpretation\nSouth African courts have developed guiding principles to interpret and apply Rule 6(12). A few notable cases illustrate the approach:\n\nLuna Meubel Vervaardigers v Makin and Another 1977 (4) SA 135 (W)\nThis seminal case by Coetzee J remains a cornerstone in interpreting urgency. The court warned against the misuse of urgent applications and emphasized that the rules should not be circumvented lightly. It held that:\n\u201cPractitioners must carefully analyse the facts to determine whether a case really deserves the court's urgent attention.\u201d\nThe court distinguished between real urgency (such as imminent harm) and self-created urgency, where a litigant delays and then invokes urgency to fast-track relief.\n\nEast Rock Trading 7 (Pty) Ltd v Eagle Valley Granite (Pty) Ltd 2012 JDR 1836 (GSJ)\nHere, the court reiterated that urgency must be assessed objectively and warned that self-created urgency will not justify departure from the rules. An applicant who sits on their hands and then seeks urgent relief faces dismissal on procedural grounds.\n\nCaledon Street Restaurants CC v Monica D'Aviera 1998 (4) SA 10 (C)\nThis case clarified that the test is not merely whether the matter is urgent, but whether the applicant cannot obtain substantial redress at a hearing in due course. If eventual relief can still be meaningful, the matter should follow normal timelines.\n\nMisuse and Judicial Scrutiny\nGiven the risk of procedural abuse, courts often deal with Rule 6(12) applications critically. Applicants must:\n*        Show diligence,\n*        Act promptly upon learning of the facts giving rise to the urgency,\n*        Provide full and frank disclosure,\n*        Avoid creating urgency through tactical delay.\nFailure to meet these standards may result in the application being struck off the roll or punitive costs orders.\n\nConclusion\nRule 6(12) serves a vital function in protecting litigants\u2019 rights in time-sensitive matters. However, the threshold is high: urgency must be real, not contrived, and applicants must convincingly show that waiting for the normal court process would result in injustice. Courts continue to interpret the rule with caution to ensure that it remains a remedy for exceptional circumstances\u2014not a procedural shortcut.\n\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Ian Levitt <ian@ianlevitt.co.za <mailto:ian@ianlevitt.co.za> >\nSent: Friday, 07 November 2025 07:29\nTo: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone <mailto:jax@regima.zone> >; Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za <mailto:block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za> >; Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za <mailto:Natan@ianlevitt.co.za> >\nCc: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com <mailto:dan@regima.com> >\nSubject: RE: ARE YOU ABLE TO OPPOSE PART A OF THE EXPARTE INTERDICT, THE FIRST ONE\n\nCan we please have a teams and discuss the memo to client?\n\nNatan please set up.\n\nIAN LEVITT\n\nTHE LEONARDO\nOFFICE LEVEL 12\n75 MAUDE STREET\nSANDOWN\nSANDTON, 2196\nDX 54 SANDTON SQUARE\nTEL:      011 784 3310\nCell :  082 445 1586\nwww.ianlevitt.co.za <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.ianlevitt.co.za_&d=DwMFAg&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=7ZULBZmD5L4dM8U3nU-5WA&m=CykiEeHtzpC3UoPNvgUavjpVzIitb4TT0eYRBj4XtRZxo8tS5Utzvuue_JWu4h68&s=8kpC5LXoFodm86SAZDwqCP3WkNvHwmgod7BUTC2KX7Q&e=> \n\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE:\n\nThis email is intended solely for the recipient(s) to whom this email is addressed.

The interdict prevents access to reporting systems, creating immediate violations.\n2.\t\n\tPrevents Safety Corrections: Article 5(2) requires the RP to \"immediately\" inform authorities of products presenting human health risks. The word \"immediately\" admits no exceptions for court orders.\n3.\t\n\tObstructs Market Surveillance: Article 22 requires competent authorities to monitor compliance through the RP. The interdict severs this regulatory link, blinding authorities to safety issues.\n4.\t\n\tCreates Regulatory Vacuum: Products remain on market without legally required oversight, analogous to operating a nuclear facility without a licensed safety officer.\n\nInternational Regulatory Equivalence\nThe Responsible Person parallels:\n*\tFDA's \"Responsible Person\" under MoCRA (US - 21 USC 364)\n*\tUK's \"Responsible Person\" under Schedule 34 (post-Brexit continuation)\n*\tHealth Canada's \"Regulatory Correspondent\" under Cosmetic Regulations\n*\tASEAN's \"Safety Assessor\" under ACD Guidelines\nEach creates a designated regulatory interface with enforcement authorities.\nBlocking this position obstructs governmental safety oversight.\nCriminal Implications\nUK Regulation 12(2)(a) Cosmetic Products Enforcement Regulations 2013:\n\t\"A person is guilty of an offence if that person intentionally obstructs any person acting in the execution or enforcement of these Regulations.\"\nThe interdict preventing RP functions constitutes intentional obstruction of regulatory enforcement, exposing Peter to criminal prosecution in each affected jurisdiction.\nThe Core Issue\nThis is not about private commercial dispute resolution.\nThe interdict attempts to prevent a designated safety officer from performing mandatory governmental oversight functions.\nIt is legally equivalent to obtaining a court order preventing:\n*\tAn air traffic controller from directing planes\n*\tA pharmacist from verifying prescriptions\n*\tA building inspector from examining structures\nThe regulatory framework contains zero provisions allowing suspension of RP duties for any reason - bankruptcy, litigation, force majeure, or court orders.\nConsumer safety obligations are absolute and continuous.\nBottom line:\nThe interdict interferes with a statutory regulatory office carrying governmental oversight responsibilities, not merely a private employee performing commercial functions.\nThis transforms a civil dispute into obstruction of regulatory enforcement across 31 jurisdictions and potentially 6 others.\n________________________________\nFrom: Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za>\nSent: Friday, 17 October 2025 17:57\nTo: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>; Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: d@rzo.io <d@rzo.io>; Ian Levitt <ian@ianlevitt.co.za>; Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za>\nSubject: Re: FAUCITT - URGENT FEEDBACK \nCan we please consult urgently next week.

The challenge is mainly that the primary evidence base I have is 3 years worth of forensic evidence prepared for two parallel criminal cases and a third that I am preparing to file in the near future. As such there is a mountain of evidence from up to 7 different sources arranged specifically to meet the \"beyond reasonable doubt\" requirement along with aggressive language and claims. I think I have managed to select the most relevant pieces of evidence to refute the mistaken claims of Peter's interdict without compromising the integrity of the criminal case by exposing it to those involved.\nMy personal bank statements refute the 500k claim and the Shopify invoices demonstrate that the RegimA Worldwide revenue is actually owned and paid for by my IK entity RegimA Zone Ltd which shows how \"Worldwide\" is not a single entity but many with various international expenses all paid for by me anyway. I do not wish to attack Peter or make any derogatory statements, only to prove his mistake and ask that the interdict be set aside so that we can continue with a voluntary and collaborative forensic audit with transparency so that all checks and balances are done in the open to everyone's satisfaction.\nMy primary concerns follow as parts 2 and 3..\nThe second is the hijacking of the revenue streams by Rynette Farrar resulting in audit trails also being removed. For this matter my request is simply that the court order the reinstatement of the POPIA compliant Shopify plaforms we have used for over a decade as it was before the interference. The stores are still being paid for and awaiting order to resume. As for any damages in this regard I request only that we need to gather more evidence as this forms part of a much larger criminal case.\nThe third and final point of current concern is the covert appointment of accountant Bantjies (by Rynette Farrar who controls Peter's email address in July 2024)as a Trustee of our family trust. Mr Bantjies is the accountant, trustee, commissioner of oaths and principal debtor to both Pete and Jacqui with a sum of over R18 million coming due in May 2026. This is an extreme conflict of interests as if Mr Bantjies were to find that the entire family was declared incapacitated by dishonest medical professionals before May 2026 they would fall under the curatorship of Mr Bantjies who would no longer need to pay the debt and would also control the entire estate forever. Thus if all parties still feel it necessary given the interdict claims are disproven, regardless it must be stated - No medical testing can take place prior to the May 2026 payout and for that matter cannot take place while he is a trustee on our family trust!\nPlease see attached and below a summary of what I think is necessary for us to submit below:\n---------\nResponse Affidavit & Annexures\nOverview\nImplemented complete legal affidavits for the rescission application to set aside the ex parte interdict granted on 19 August 2025 in Case No: 2025-137857 (Dan & Jax v.

Main Responding Affidavit\nEstablishes three independent grounds for setting aside the interdict (any one sufficient):\n\u00b7       Ground 1: Material Non-Disclosure - Documents 8 categories of facts Peter concealed from the Court, rendering the interdict void ab initio under the uberrima fides principle:\n\t1.\tResponsible Person regulatory crisis (R50M+ exposure, 37 jurisdictions)\n\t2.\tSettlement agreement timing (signed 8 days before interdict)\n\t3.\tInvestment payout timing (R18M due May 2026, 9 months after interdict)\n\t4.\tPeter's own disruptive actions (card cancellation, system lockout)\n\t5.\tDirector loan account structure (R500K was repayment, not gift)\n\t6.\tHistorical collaborative business model (20+ years established practice)\n\t7.\tDisproportionate harm (136:1 ratio - R68M harm vs R500K concern)\n\t8.\tTransfer of control to non-director (Rynette Farrar)\n\u00b7       Ground 2: False Factual Premises - Proves core allegations are factually incorrect:\no   R500K \"unauthorized gift\" is FALSE (was authorized director loan repayment)\no   \"UK owes SA\" claim is FALSE (UK is creditor, paid USD150,000+ for platform)\no   Third-party evidence (26+ Shopify invoices) proves payment direction: UK \u2192 SA\n\u00b7       Ground 3: Gross Disproportionality - Constitutional violation:\n\t*\t136:1 harm ratio (R68,141,648+ harm vs R500,000 concern)\n\t*\tViolates proportionality principle\n\t*\tPeter derives NO benefit (exposed to R110M+ liability)\n\n2. Supporting Affidavit - Shopify/Rynette Evidence\nDocuments platform ownership and criminal revenue hijacking:\n*\tPlatform Ownership: Third-party evidence (Shopify email 26 July 2017, 26+ invoices) proves UK entity owns and funded platform with R677,288+ investment\n*\tRevenue Hijacking: Criminal enterprise timeline showing Rynette Farrar's systematic theft:\n\t*\tCompany registration (Adderory - April 2021)\n\t*\tBank account hijacking (14 April 2025)\n\t*\tEvidence destruction (22 May 2025 - 7 days after confrontation)\n\t*\tDomain takeover, customer theft\n\t*\tTotal theft: R14,500,000+ (R97,000/day ongoing)\n*\tUrgent Relief: 48-hour platform restoration order, audit trail recovery, Adderory account freeze, forensic investigation\n\n3. Supporting Affidavit - Bantjies/Medical Testing (642 lines)\nAddresses trustee conflicts and medical testing manipulation risks:\n*\tMultiple Conflicting Roles: Bantjies serves as Accountant + Trustee + Commissioner of Oaths (unacceptable concentration)\n*\tFalse Sworn Statements: Already provided false confirmatory affidavit (JF-BANTJIES1 contradicts JF-BANTJIES2)\n*\tR18M Payout at Risk: Investment due May 2026, medical testing scheduled October 2025 (7 months before payout)\n*\tManipulation Scenario: 8-step analysis showing how role concentration enables manipulation of medical testing to control R18M\n*\tCui Bono Analysis: Peter derives NO benefit; only Rynette (R97K/day theft) and Bantjies (R18M control) benefit\n*\tRelief Required: Suspend Bantjies, appoint independent trustee, delay testing until AFTER May 2026 payout, protect R18M with independent oversight\n\nKey Metrics Documented\nMetric\nAmount\nContext\nHarm Ratio\n136:1\nR68M+ harm vs R500K concern\nRevenue Theft\nR14.5M+\nRynette Farrar criminal enterprise\nDaily Theft\nR97,000\nOngoing while interdict in place\nPersonal Bleeding\nR100K/month\nDan & Jax paying from personal funds\nRegulatory Exposure\nR50M+\n37 jurisdictions, Responsible Person\nPlatform Investment\nUSD150,000+\nUK entity paid since 2023\nEvidence References\nAll evidence from the problem statement properly cited with 100+ references including:\n\u00b7       Third-party evidence: JF1 (Shopify email), DF4/DF5/DF6 (26+ invoices)\n\u00b7       Financial evidence: JF-BS1 (bank statement), JF-DLA1/2/3 (director loans), JF-PA1-4 (Peter's withdrawals)\n\u00b7       Timeline evidence: JF5 (settlement 11 Aug), JF-INVESTMENT1 (R18M May 2026), JF9 (evidence destruction 22 May)\n\u00b7       Regulatory evidence: JF-RP1/2 (37 jurisdictions, R50M+ exposure)\n\u00b7       Criminal evidence: JF-CIPC-ADDERORY, JF-BANK-CHANGE, JF-AUDIT-DESTRUCTION\n\u00b7       Trustee evidence: JF-TRUST1, JF-BANTJIES1/2, JF5-DRAFT/FINAL/COMPARISON\n\nRelief Sought\nPrimary:\n*\tSet aside ex parte interdict (19 August 2025)\n*\tCosts on attorney-and-client scale (including two counsel)\n*\tCriminal referral to NPA (perjury, fraud, theft)\nPlatform Restoration (Urgent):\n*\t48-hour order for Shopify access restoration\n*\tAudit trail recovery from Shopify backups\n*\tAdderory account freeze\n*\tForensic investigation appointment\nTrustee Protection:\n*\tBantjies suspended pending investigation\n*\tIndependent interim trustee appointed\n*\tMedical testing stayed until AFTER May 2026 payout\n*\tR18M payout protected with beneficiary consent required\n ----\nWarm Regards\nDan\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za>\nSent: Friday, October 17, 2025 16:25\nTo: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>; Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za>\nSubject: Re: FAUCITT - URGENT FEEDBACK\nDear Daniel,\nThe documents are quite difficult to follow, as they appear to have been AI-generated.

If I spend any longer on the formatting there will be nothing so it seems we need someone who is able to help with formatting documents how you need them. I can generate markdown and convert to pdf & docx but to actually recover the original formatting requires using the actual word program.\nAnyway the best I can do is send the docx versions I have with the AD headers. Please let me know if you can open this then I will format the others similarly and send.\nWarm Regards\nDan\n________________________________\nFrom: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nSent: Wednesday, 15 October 2025 19:34\nTo: Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za>; Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: Ian Levitt <ian@ianlevitt.co.za>; Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za>\nSubject: Re: FAUCITT - URGENT FEEDBACK\nIt's nearly done with each AD processed and a series of notes 90% there i'm just cross-referencing the response paras with the notes and annexures will send through soon.\nWarm Regards,\nDan \n________________________________\nFrom: Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za>\nSent: Wednesday, 15 October 2025 18:38\nTo: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>; Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: Ian Levitt <ian@ianlevitt.co.za>; Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za>\nSubject: FAUCITT - URGENT FEEDBACK\nDear Jacqui and Daniel,\nWe have sent our draft for consideration over a week ago.

I'm preventing us from legitimizing a criminal fraud by treating it as valid.\nTo the best of my understanding, the law is clear - fraud vitiates everything.\nCan we please focus on the rescission application based on proven perjury rather than responding to disputes in a criminally void document?\nWarm Regards,\nDan\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPLEASE SEE ADDENDA BELOW RELATING TO MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE SITUATION AND Rule 6(12)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou cannot answer \"disputes\" in a document obtained by perjury - doing so validates the crime.\nThe strategy must be:\n1.\tAttack the legitimacy (void ab initio)\n2.\tProve the perjury (criminal evidence)\n3.\tRefuse engagement (no Part B response)\n4.\tCriminal referral (not civil litigation)\nThis isn't stubbornness - it's correct legal strategy when dealing with criminally fraudulent proceedings.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUrgent Applications and the Interpretation of Rule 6(12) in South African Courts\nUrgent applications are a critical component of South African civil procedure, enabling litigants to approach the courts for immediate relief in circumstances where the ordinary procedural timelines would render justice ineffective or moot. Rule 6(12) of the Uniform Rules of Court governs the procedure for bringing such applications, and its interpretation by the courts reflects a careful balancing of the right to urgent relief and the need to prevent abuse of process.\nRule 6(12) provides as follows:\n\"(a) In urgent applications the court or a judge may dispense with the forms and service provided for in these rules and may dispose of such matter at such time and place and in such manner and in accordance with such procedure (which shall as far as practicable be in terms of these rules) as it deems fit.\n(b) In every affidavit filed in support of any application under paragraph (a) of this subrule, the applicant shall set forth explicitly the circumstances which he avers render the matter urgent and the reasons why he claims that he could not be afforded substantial redress at a hearing in due course.\"\nKey Elements of Rule 6(12)\nThere are two key elements that an applicant must satisfy for an urgent application to be entertained:\n1.\tUrgency: The applicant must demonstrate that the matter is genuinely urgent.\n2.\tLack of Substantial Redress: The applicant must show that he or she will not obtain substantial redress in due course if the matter were to proceed in the ordinary way.\nCourts require these elements to be clearly and explicitly set out in the founding affidavit. The mere assertion of urgency, or inconvenience caused by delay, is not sufficient.\nJudicial Interpretation\nSouth African courts have developed guiding principles to interpret and apply Rule 6(12). A few notable cases illustrate the approach:\nLuna Meubel Vervaardigers v Makin and Another 1977 (4) SA 135 (W)\nThis seminal case by Coetzee J remains a cornerstone in interpreting urgency. The court warned against the misuse of urgent applications and emphasized that the rules should not be circumvented lightly. It held that:\n\u201cPractitioners must carefully analyse the facts to determine whether a case really deserves the court's urgent attention.\u201d\nThe court distinguished between real urgency (such as imminent harm) and self-created urgency, where a litigant delays and then invokes urgency to fast-track relief.\nEast Rock Trading 7 (Pty) Ltd v Eagle Valley Granite (Pty) Ltd 2012 JDR 1836 (GSJ)\nHere, the court reiterated that urgency must be assessed objectively and warned that self-created urgency will not justify departure from the rules. An applicant who sits on their hands and then seeks urgent relief faces dismissal on procedural grounds.\nCaledon Street Restaurants CC v Monica D'Aviera 1998 (4) SA 10 (C)\nThis case clarified that the test is not merely whether the matter is urgent, but whether the applicant cannot obtain substantial redress at a hearing in due course. If eventual relief can still be meaningful, the matter should follow normal timelines.\nMisuse and Judicial Scrutiny\nGiven the risk of procedural abuse, courts often deal with Rule 6(12) applications critically. Applicants must:\n*\tShow diligence,\n*\tAct promptly upon learning of the facts giving rise to the urgency,\n*\tProvide full and frank disclosure,\n*\tAvoid creating urgency through tactical delay.\nFailure to meet these standards may result in the application being struck off the roll or punitive costs orders.\nConclusion\nRule 6(12) serves a vital function in protecting litigants\u2019 rights in time-sensitive matters. However, the threshold is high: urgency must be real, not contrived, and applicants must convincingly show that waiting for the normal court process would result in injustice. Courts continue to interpret the rule with caution to ensure that it remains a remedy for exceptional circumstances\u2014not a procedural shortcut.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Ian Levitt <ian@ianlevitt.co.za>\nSent: Friday, 07 November 2025 07:29\nTo: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>; Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za>; Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za>\nCc: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nSubject: RE: ARE YOU ABLE TO OPPOSE PART A OF THE EXPARTE INTERDICT, THE FIRST ONE \n\nCan we please have a teams and discuss the memo to client?\n\nNatan please set up.\n\nIAN LEVITT\n\nTHE LEONARDO\nOFFICE LEVEL 12\n75 MAUDE STREET\nSANDOWN\nSANDTON, 2196\nDX 54 SANDTON SQUARE\nTEL:      011 784 3310 \nCell :  082 445 1586\nwww.ianlevitt.co.za <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.ianlevitt.co.za_&d=DwMFAg&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=7ZULBZmD5L4dM8U3nU-5WA&m=CykiEeHtzpC3UoPNvgUavjpVzIitb4TT0eYRBj4XtRZxo8tS5Utzvuue_JWu4h68&s=8kpC5LXoFodm86SAZDwqCP3WkNvHwmgod7BUTC2KX7Q&e=> \n\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: \n\nThis email is intended solely for the recipient(s) to whom this email is addressed.

This adds another layer of liability.\nBasically I (Daniel) am quite happy to let the interdict remain in place indefinitely as it has absolutely no effect on me in the long term. The businesses in question are for all practical purposes an office building (Villa Via) where without Jacqui the only thing left is a fulfilment warehouse for picking & packing (RegimA Skin Treatments) of customer orders placed through distributors (RegimA Worldwide Distribution). All other functions are outsourced.\nIn contrast, every day and every hour where Jacqui is prevented from fulfilling the duties of her regulatory office is another day and another hour that the business is being allowed to operate without mandatory regulatory oversight.\n** IMPORTANT:\nThe regulatory obligations on Jacqui relate to consumer safety and broader health & safety in many jurisdictions as she holds a regulatory office that supersedes any and all commercial or personal disputes. Daniel is registered as the \"Responsible Person\" for market compliance related to information and trading standards in each region but these obligations are not concerned with safety but more administrative duties not requiring the physical inspection of facilities or laboratory studies of physical products.\nIt is necessary to urgently resolve Jacqui's ability to perform her regulatory functions related to product safety and manufacturing standards. Only Jacqui can approve each batch of products for distribution to the various markets and file the necessary material safety data reports to clear the products for export.\nWe must therefore focus only on resolving the material non-disclosure of Jacqui's regulatory office separately and deal with claims against Daniel at a later time. Jacqui and Daniel cannot be treated as the same entity in the interdict since the interdict applied to Jacqui represents a criminal breach of international regulatory compliance and an obstruction of mandatory consumer safety procedures.\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nSent: Saturday, 18 October 2025 08:10\nTo: Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za>; Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: d@rzo.io <d@rzo.io>; Ian Levitt <ian@ianlevitt.co.za>; Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za>\nSubject: EU-1223/2009 REGULATORY OFFICE DESIGNATION: \"RESPONSIBLE PERSON\" AS STATUTORY POSITION \nREGULATORY OFFICE DESIGNATION:\n\n\"RESPONSIBLE PERSON\" AS STATUTORY POSITION\nThe \"Responsible Person\" under EU Regulation 1223/2009 is a mandatory regulatory office, not a descriptive term.\nThis is a legally designated position with statutory authority and personal liability, analogous to a Data Protection Officer under GDPR or a Money Laundering Reporting Officer under AML directives.\nLegal Architecture of the Position\nArticle 4(1) of Regulation 1223/2009 states categorically:\n\t\"Only cosmetic products for which a legal or natural person is designated within the Community as 'responsible person' shall be placed on the market.\"\nThis creates an absolute market access requirement.\nWithout a designated Responsible Person, products are legally prohibited from EU/EEA markets across 31 jurisdictions.\nStatutory Duties (Non-Delegable)\nThe Responsible Person holds personal regulatory liability for:\n*\tProduct safety assessments (Article 10)\n*\tMaintaining Product Information Files (Article 11)\n*\tCPNP notifications to competent authorities (Article 13)\n*\tSerious Undesirable Effects reporting within 20 days (Article 23)\n*\tImmediate corrective actions when products present risks (Article 5)\n*\tGood Manufacturing Practice compliance (Article 8)\nThese are non-delegable duties - the RP cannot transfer liability to subordinates or contractors.\nThe designation creates personal criminal and civil exposure.\nInterference with Regulatory Oversight\nThe interdict constitutes unlawful interference with regulatory functions because:\n1.\t\n\tBlocks Mandatory Reporting: The RP must report SUEs to competent authorities within 20 days. The interdict prevents access to reporting systems, creating immediate violations.\n2.\t\n\tPrevents Safety Corrections: Article 5(2) requires the RP to \"immediately\" inform authorities of products presenting human health risks. The word \"immediately\" admits no exceptions for court orders.\n3.\t\n\tObstructs Market Surveillance: Article 22 requires competent authorities to monitor compliance through the RP. The interdict severs this regulatory link, blinding authorities to safety issues.\n4.\t\n\tCreates Regulatory Vacuum: Products remain on market without legally required oversight, analogous to operating a nuclear facility without a licensed safety officer.\n\nInternational Regulatory Equivalence\nThe Responsible Person parallels:\n*\tFDA's \"Responsible Person\" under MoCRA (US - 21 USC 364)\n*\tUK's \"Responsible Person\" under Schedule 34 (post-Brexit continuation)\n*\tHealth Canada's \"Regulatory Correspondent\" under Cosmetic Regulations\n*\tASEAN's \"Safety Assessor\" under ACD Guidelines\nEach creates a designated regulatory interface with enforcement authorities.\nBlocking this position obstructs governmental safety oversight.\nCriminal Implications\nUK Regulation 12(2)(a) Cosmetic Products Enforcement Regulations 2013:\n\t\"A person is guilty of an offence if that person intentionally obstructs any person acting in the execution or enforcement of these Regulations.\"\nThe interdict preventing RP functions constitutes intentional obstruction of regulatory enforcement, exposing Peter to criminal prosecution in each affected jurisdiction.\nThe Core Issue\nThis is not about private commercial dispute resolution.\nThe interdict attempts to prevent a designated safety officer from performing mandatory governmental oversight functions.\nIt is legally equivalent to obtaining a court order preventing:\n*\tAn air traffic controller from directing planes\n*\tA pharmacist from verifying prescriptions\n*\tA building inspector from examining structures\nThe regulatory framework contains zero provisions allowing suspension of RP duties for any reason - bankruptcy, litigation, force majeure, or court orders.\nConsumer safety obligations are absolute and continuous.\nBottom line:\nThe interdict interferes with a statutory regulatory office carrying governmental oversight responsibilities, not merely a private employee performing commercial functions.\nThis transforms a civil dispute into obstruction of regulatory enforcement across 31 jurisdictions and potentially 6 others.\n________________________________\nFrom: Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za>\nSent: Friday, 17 October 2025 17:57\nTo: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>; Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: d@rzo.io <d@rzo.io>; Ian Levitt <ian@ianlevitt.co.za>; Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za>\nSubject: Re: FAUCITT - URGENT FEEDBACK \nCan we please consult urgently next week.

The challenge is mainly that the primary evidence base I have is 3 years worth of forensic evidence prepared for two parallel criminal cases and a third that I am preparing to file in the near future. As such there is a mountain of evidence from up to 7 different sources arranged specifically to meet the \"beyond reasonable doubt\" requirement along with aggressive language and claims. I think I have managed to select the most relevant pieces of evidence to refute the mistaken claims of Peter's interdict without compromising the integrity of the criminal case by exposing it to those involved.\nMy personal bank statements refute the 500k claim and the Shopify invoices demonstrate that the RegimA Worldwide revenue is actually owned and paid for by my IK entity RegimA Zone Ltd which shows how \"Worldwide\" is not a single entity but many with various international expenses all paid for by me anyway. I do not wish to attack Peter or make any derogatory statements, only to prove his mistake and ask that the interdict be set aside so that we can continue with a voluntary and collaborative forensic audit with transparency so that all checks and balances are done in the open to everyone's satisfaction.\nMy primary concerns follow as parts 2 and 3..\nThe second is the hijacking of the revenue streams by Rynette Farrar resulting in audit trails also being removed. For this matter my request is simply that the court order the reinstatement of the POPIA compliant Shopify plaforms we have used for over a decade as it was before the interference. The stores are still being paid for and awaiting order to resume. As for any damages in this regard I request only that we need to gather more evidence as this forms part of a much larger criminal case.\nThe third and final point of current concern is the covert appointment of accountant Bantjies (by Rynette Farrar who controls Peter's email address in July 2024)as a Trustee of our family trust. Mr Bantjies is the accountant, trustee, commissioner of oaths and principal debtor to both Pete and Jacqui with a sum of over R18 million coming due in May 2026. This is an extreme conflict of interests as if Mr Bantjies were to find that the entire family was declared incapacitated by dishonest medical professionals before May 2026 they would fall under the curatorship of Mr Bantjies who would no longer need to pay the debt and would also control the entire estate forever. Thus if all parties still feel it necessary given the interdict claims are disproven, regardless it must be stated - No medical testing can take place prior to the May 2026 payout and for that matter cannot take place while he is a trustee on our family trust!\nPlease see attached and below a summary of what I think is necessary for us to submit below:\n---------\nResponse Affidavit & Annexures\nOverview\nImplemented complete legal affidavits for the rescission application to set aside the ex parte interdict granted on 19 August 2025 in Case No: 2025-137857 (Dan & Jax v. Peter Faucitt).\nImplementation Summary\nThree comprehensive legal affidavits organized in  /case_2025_137857/01_court_documents/rescission_application/:\n1. Main Responding Affidavit\nEstablishes three independent grounds for setting aside the interdict (any one sufficient):\n\u00b7       Ground 1: Material Non-Disclosure - Documents 8 categories of facts Peter concealed from the Court, rendering the interdict void ab initio under the uberrima fides principle:\n\t1.\tResponsible Person regulatory crisis (R50M+ exposure, 37 jurisdictions)\n\t2.\tSettlement agreement timing (signed 8 days before interdict)\n\t3.\tInvestment payout timing (R18M due May 2026, 9 months after interdict)\n\t4.\tPeter's own disruptive actions (card cancellation, system lockout)\n\t5.\tDirector loan account structure (R500K was repayment, not gift)\n\t6.\tHistorical collaborative business model (20+ years established practice)\n\t7.\tDisproportionate harm (136:1 ratio - R68M harm vs R500K concern)\n\t8.\tTransfer of control to non-director (Rynette Farrar)\n\u00b7       Ground 2: False Factual Premises - Proves core allegations are factually incorrect:\no   R500K \"unauthorized gift\" is FALSE (was authorized director loan repayment)\no   \"UK owes SA\" claim is FALSE (UK is creditor, paid USD150,000+ for platform)\no   Third-party evidence (26+ Shopify invoices) proves payment direction: UK \u2192 SA\n\u00b7       Ground 3: Gross Disproportionality - Constitutional violation:\n\t*\t136:1 harm ratio (R68,141,648+ harm vs R500,000 concern)\n\t*\tViolates proportionality principle\n\t*\tPeter derives NO benefit (exposed to R110M+ liability)\n\n2. Supporting Affidavit - Shopify/Rynette Evidence\nDocuments platform ownership and criminal revenue hijacking:\n*\tPlatform Ownership: Third-party evidence (Shopify email 26 July 2017, 26+ invoices) proves UK entity owns and funded platform with R677,288+ investment\n*\tRevenue Hijacking: Criminal enterprise timeline showing Rynette Farrar's systematic theft:\n\t*\tCompany registration (Adderory - April 2021)\n\t*\tBank account hijacking (14 April 2025)\n\t*\tEvidence destruction (22 May 2025 - 7 days after confrontation)\n\t*\tDomain takeover, customer theft\n\t*\tTotal theft: R14,500,000+ (R97,000/day ongoing)\n*\tUrgent Relief: 48-hour platform restoration order, audit trail recovery, Adderory account freeze, forensic investigation\n\n3. Supporting Affidavit - Bantjies/Medical Testing (642 lines)\nAddresses trustee conflicts and medical testing manipulation risks:\n*\tMultiple Conflicting Roles: Bantjies serves as Accountant + Trustee + Commissioner of Oaths (unacceptable concentration)\n*\tFalse Sworn Statements: Already provided false confirmatory affidavit (JF-BANTJIES1 contradicts JF-BANTJIES2)\n*\tR18M Payout at Risk: Investment due May 2026, medical testing scheduled October 2025 (7 months before payout)\n*\tManipulation Scenario: 8-step analysis showing how role concentration enables manipulation of medical testing to control R18M\n*\tCui Bono Analysis: Peter derives NO benefit; only Rynette (R97K/day theft) and Bantjies (R18M control) benefit\n*\tRelief Required: Suspend Bantjies, appoint independent trustee, delay testing until AFTER May 2026 payout, protect R18M with independent oversight\n\nKey Metrics Documented\nMetric\nAmount\nContext\nHarm Ratio\n136:1\nR68M+ harm vs R500K concern\nRevenue Theft\nR14.5M+\nRynette Farrar criminal enterprise\nDaily Theft\nR97,000\nOngoing while interdict in place\nPersonal Bleeding\nR100K/month\nDan & Jax paying from personal funds\nRegulatory Exposure\nR50M+\n37 jurisdictions, Responsible Person\nPlatform Investment\nUSD150,000+\nUK entity paid since 2023\nEvidence References\nAll evidence from the problem statement properly cited with 100+ references including:\n\u00b7       Third-party evidence: JF1 (Shopify email), DF4/DF5/DF6 (26+ invoices)\n\u00b7       Financial evidence: JF-BS1 (bank statement), JF-DLA1/2/3 (director loans), JF-PA1-4 (Peter's withdrawals)\n\u00b7       Timeline evidence: JF5 (settlement 11 Aug), JF-INVESTMENT1 (R18M May 2026), JF9 (evidence destruction 22 May)\n\u00b7       Regulatory evidence: JF-RP1/2 (37 jurisdictions, R50M+ exposure)\n\u00b7       Criminal evidence: JF-CIPC-ADDERORY, JF-BANK-CHANGE, JF-AUDIT-DESTRUCTION\n\u00b7       Trustee evidence: JF-TRUST1, JF-BANTJIES1/2, JF5-DRAFT/FINAL/COMPARISON\n\nRelief Sought\nPrimary:\n*\tSet aside ex parte interdict (19 August 2025)\n*\tCosts on attorney-and-client scale (including two counsel)\n*\tCriminal referral to NPA (perjury, fraud, theft)\nPlatform Restoration (Urgent):\n*\t48-hour order for Shopify access restoration\n*\tAudit trail recovery from Shopify backups\n*\tAdderory account freeze\n*\tForensic investigation appointment\nTrustee Protection:\n*\tBantjies suspended pending investigation\n*\tIndependent interim trustee appointed\n*\tMedical testing stayed until AFTER May 2026 payout\n*\tR18M payout protected with beneficiary consent required\n ----\nWarm Regards\nDan\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za>\nSent: Friday, October 17, 2025 16:25\nTo: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>; Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za>\nSubject: Re: FAUCITT - URGENT FEEDBACK\nDear Daniel,\nThe documents are quite difficult to follow, as they appear to have been AI-generated.

If his claims are valid then how can any revenue generated on these platforms belong to RWD?\n\nPriority: 1 - Critical\nTopic: RegimA Worldwide Distribution Revenue Legitimacy Questions\nContext: Addressing Peter's Central Premise on Financial Allegations\n________________________________\nOverview\nThis document addresses fundamental questions about RegimA Worldwide Distribution (RWD) revenue integrity that Peter must answer given his allegations about IT expenses and the R500K payment. If Peter questions RWD's expenditures, then the legitimacy and structure of RWD's revenues must similarly be subjected to scrutiny.\n________________________________\nCritical Questions Peter Must Answer\n1. RWD's Trust Structure vs. RegimA SA (RSA)\nQuestion: Does Peter claim that RegimA Worldwide Distribution operates differently to RegimA SA?\nAnalysis:\n*\t\n\tRSA Structure: RegimA SA operates with a structure where all moneys entering its bank account are held in trust for distribution to beneficiaries:\n*\t\n\tRegimA Skin Treatments (Manufacturer)\n*\t\n\tDermal Skin (Distributor)\n*\t\n\tRWD Structure: If RWD operates similarly as a trust vehicle:\n*\t\n\tRWD should hold revenues in trust for distribution to beneficiaries\n*\t\n\tRWD should not appropriate funds as its own\n*\t\n\tRWD should maintain clear accounting of trust distributions\nPeter's Inconsistency:\n*\tPeter questions RWD expenditures as if RWD owns the funds absolutely\n*\tPeter fails to acknowledge RWD's potential trust structure similar to RSA\n*\tIf RWD is a trust vehicle, then questioning individual expenditures without considering trust obligations is misleading\n________________________________\n2. RWD's Revenue Generation Capacity\nQuestion: Can Peter provide proof that RegimA Worldwide Distribution generated the revenue claimed as distinct from moneys in its bank accounts?\nKey Facts:\n*\tRWD does not hold any stock that it could sell\n*\tRWD has no inventory or physical assets to generate independent revenue\n*\tRWD cannot manufacture or distribute products directly\nRevenue Reality:\n*\tRWD issued invoices based on sales made through several stores listed on the Shopify platform\n*\tCritical Detail: The Shopify platform has been owned and paid for since July 2023 by Daniel Faucitt's independent UK entity RegimA Zone Ltd\n*\tDaniel's UK company has funded RWD operations continuously (R140K-R280K over 28 months)\nImplication: If RWD generated \"revenue,\" these were invoices for sales occurring on a platform:\n1.\tOwned by Daniel's UK entity (RegimA Zone Ltd)\n2.\tPaid for by Daniel's UK entity\n3.\tOperated by Daniel and Jacqueline\n4.\tCustomer relationships managed by Daniel's operations\n________________________________\n3. RWD's Purpose as Trust Vehicle\nQuestion: If RWD does not operate as a Trust and instead appropriates all funds moving through its accounts as its own, then what purpose does it serve as a vehicle owned by the Faucitt Family Trust?\nAnalysis:\nScenario A: RWD Operates as Trust\n*\tFunds are held in trust for distribution to beneficiaries\n*\tRWD has fiduciary obligations to beneficiaries\n*\tExpenditures must be evaluated in context of trust administration\n*\tPeter's allegations ignore trust structure and obligations\nScenario B: RWD Appropriates Funds\n*\tRWD claims all revenues as its own property\n*\tNo trust structure for distribution\n*\tQuestion: What legitimate purpose does RWD serve as a Faucitt Family Trust asset?\n*\tIf RWD operates for personal enrichment, this contradicts trust law principles\nPeter's Dilemma:\n*\tIf RWD is a trust \u2192 Peter's expenditure allegations lack context of trust obligations\n*\tIf RWD is not a trust \u2192 RWD's purpose as trust asset is questionable and potentially fraudulent\n________________________________\n4. Evidence of Payments to Revenue Source\nQuestion: Can RWD produce evidence of payments made to the entity through which customers placed orders?\nCritical Gap:\n*\tCustomers placed orders through Shopify platform owned by Daniel's UK entity (RegimA Zone Ltd)\n*\tRegimA Zone Ltd paid for the platform infrastructure ($1,000-$2,000+ USD/month)\n*\tHas RWD ever compensated RegimA Zone Ltd for:\n*\tUse of the Shopify platform?\n*\tCustomer acquisition costs?\n*\tPlatform hosting and maintenance?\n*\tTechnology infrastructure?\nPayment Flow Analysis:\nWhat Should Have Happened:\nCustomer Order (via RZ Ltd Shopify) \n \u2192 Payment to RWD \n \u2192 RWD pays platform fee to RZ Ltd\n \u2192 RWD pays manufacturer (RST)\n \u2192 RWD pays distributor (appropriate entity)\nWhat Actually Happened:\nCustomer Order (via RZ Ltd Shopify)\n \u2192 Payment to RWD\n \u2192 RWD keeps funds\n \u2192 RZ Ltd (Daniel) continues paying Shopify costs\n \u2192 No compensation to platform owner (RZ Ltd)\n________________________________\n5. Payment Discrepancy: Manufacturer vs. Distributor\nQuestion: Can RWD explain why in a similar manner to RSA it paid the Manufacturer (RST) but failed to pay the Distributor whose Customers were using the platform to place orders?\nPayment Pattern Analysis:\nRegimA SA Model:\n*\tPays RegimA Skin Treatments (Manufacturer) \u2713\n*\tPays Dermal Skin (Distributor) \u2713\n*\tBalanced trust distribution structure\nRegimA Worldwide Distribution Model:\n*\tPays RegimA Skin Treatments (Manufacturer) \u2713\n*\tFAILS to pay the Distributor (Daniel's UK entities) \u2717\n*\tFAILS to compensate platform owner (RegimA Zone Ltd) \u2717\n*\tDistributor's customers placing orders on distributor's platform\n*\tPlatform costs borne entirely by distributor (Daniel's UK company)\nCritical Question: Why was the manufacturer paid but the distributor/platform owner who:\n*\tOwned the sales platform\n*\tPaid for the sales infrastructure\n*\tManaged customer relationships\n*\tFacilitated all order processing\n...was never compensated?\n________________________________\n6. Alternative Scenario: RSA Tax Fraud\nQuestion: Alternatively, does RSA operate as a trust either, and is Peter's strategic filing of nil income for this entity tax fraud and potential theft?\nAnalysis:\nIf Peter argues RWD is NOT a trust structure, then consistency requires examining RSA:\nOption A: RSA is a legitimate trust\n*\tAll funds held in trust for distribution\n*\tNil income filing is appropriate (trust passthrough)\n*\tThen RWD should operate similarly\n*\tPeter's allegations against RWD are inconsistent\nOption B: RSA is NOT a trust\n*\tFiling nil income while receiving revenue = tax fraud\n*\tAppropriating trust funds as personal income = theft\n*\tPeter potentially guilty of:\n*\tTax evasion\n*\tBreach of fiduciary duty\n*\tMisappropriation of funds\nPeter's Catch-22:\n*\tIf RSA is a trust \u2192 RWD should be treated as trust (Peter's allegations inappropriate)\n*\tIf RSA is not a trust \u2192 Peter committed tax fraud with nil income filings\n________________________________\nLegal Implications\n1. Burden of Proof Shifts to Peter\nPeter's allegations about RWD expenditures create reciprocal obligation to prove:\n1.\tRevenue Legitimacy:\n*\tHow RWD generated revenue without stock\n*\tEvidence of actual revenue vs. invoicing for others' sales\n2.\tPayment Trail:\n*\tEvidence of payments to platform owner (RegimA Zone Ltd)\n*\tEvidence of distributor compensation\n*\tJustification for manufacturer payment but not distributor payment\n3.\tTrust Structure Consistency:\n*\tWhether RWD operates as trust like RSA\n*\tIf not, why RSA files nil income\n*\tIf yes, why trust obligations ignored in expenditure allegations\n2. Unjust Enrichment\nIf RWD appropriated revenues from Daniel's platform without compensation:\n*\tUnjust Enrichment: RWD received benefit (revenue) without payment to provider\n*\tQuantum Meruit: Daniel entitled to reasonable value of platform services\n*\tBreach of Contract: If any agreement existed for platform use\n*\tConversion: Unauthorized use of Daniel's business infrastructure\nPotential Claims:\n*\t\n\tPlatform usage fees: ~ USD150,000 (28 months of Shopify costs alone)\n*\t\n\tCustomer acquisition costs: ?\n*\t\n\tTechnology infrastructure: ?\n*\t\n\tLost profits: ?\nTotal Potential Claim: ?\n3. Trust Asset Abandonment\nEvidence of Trust Abandonment:\n1.\tNo Funding: Trust doesn't fund RWD operations\n2.\tNo Protection: Trust allowed customer hijacking (May 2025)\n3.\tNo Management: Trust didn't protect RWD assets\n4.\tDaniel's Funding: Daniel's UK entity funded all operations\nLegal Consequence:\n*\tTrust has abandoned RWD as asset\n*\tDaniel has beneficial ownership through continuous funding\n*\tTrust cannot claim asset it failed to maintain\n*\tDaniel can claim RWD ownership\n________________________________\nCross-References to Evidence\nSupporting Documentation\n1.\tRevenue Hijacking Evidence:\n*\tjax-response/revenue-theft/29-may-domain-registration/REVENUE_HIJACKING_CRIMINAL_ANALYSIS.md\n*\tSection 8: \"Connection to Trust Disputes\"\n*\tLines 700-776: RWD ownership and trust abandonment analysis\n2.\tShopify Platform Funding:\n*\tjax-response/revenue-theft/29-may-domain-registration/REVENUE_HIJACKING_CRIMINAL_ANALYSIS.md\n*\tSection 4C: \"Cost of Funding RWD Shopify\"\n*\tDaniel's UK company paid R140K-R280K for RWD platform\n3.\tPayment Redirection Scheme:\n*\tjax-response/financial-flows/01-apr-payment-redirection/README.md\n*\tR545,000+ in diverted payments\n*\tCustomer payment fraud coordinated by Rynette\n4.\tTrust Asset Diversions:\n*\tjax-response/financial-flows/README.md\n*\tR675,000+ in unauthorized trust distributions\n5.\tBusiness Destruction Evidence:\n*\tjax-response/revenue-theft/22-may-shopify-audit/README.md\n*\tRegimA SA: R1M+ monthly revenue \u2192 R0 (100% shutdown)\n*\tR3,141,647.70 in documented 3-month losses\n________________________________\nStrategic Response Framework\nFor IT Expense Allegations (PARA 7.2-7.5)\nCounter-Argument:\n\t\"Peter questions RWD's expenditures while failing to explain how RWD generated any legitimate revenue. RWD holds no stock, no inventory, and no independent revenue-generating capacity. All sales occurred on a platform owned and paid for by Daniel's UK entity (RegimA Zone Ltd) since July 2023.\n\tIf Peter questions expenditures, he must prove:\n\t1.\tHow RWD generated revenue without assets\n\t2.\tWhether RWD compensated the platform owner (Daniel's company)\n\t3.\tWhy the distributor was never paid despite facilitating all sales\n\t4.\tWhether RWD operates as a trust like RSA or appropriates funds\n\tPeter cannot have it both ways: questioning expenditures while ignoring revenue legitimacy.\"\nFor R500K Payment Allegations (PARA 7.6-7.11)\nCounter-Argument:\n\t\"Peter's allegations about a R500,000 payment ignore fundamental questions about RWD's revenue integrity. If RWD operates as a trust vehicle like RegimA SA, then the payment must be evaluated in context of trust distributions and obligations.\n\tMoreover, Peter fails to explain why:\n\t1.\tRWD paid the manufacturer (RST) but never the distributor\n\t2.\tRWD never compensated Daniel's UK entity for 28 months of platform costs\n\t3.\tRWD appropriated revenue from sales on Daniel's platform without payment\n\tThe real question is not one payment, but systematic failure to compensate the platform owner and distributor who made all RWD 'revenue' possible.\"\nFor Financial Misconduct Allegations (PARA 10.5-10.10.23)\nCounter-Argument:\n\t\"Peter's systematic financial misconduct allegations require reciprocal examination of RWD's revenue integrity. Peter must prove:\n\t1.\tRevenue Legitimacy: How RWD generated revenue without stock or assets\n\t2.\tTrust Structure: Whether RWD operates as trust or appropriates funds\n\t3.\tPayment Evidence: Proof of payments to platform owner (RegimA Zone Ltd)\n\t4.\tDistributor Compensation: Why distributor never paid despite facilitating sales\n\t5.\tRSA Consistency: If RWD is not a trust, is RSA's nil income filing tax fraud?\n\tPeter's allegations collapse under scrutiny when revenue integrity is examined. RWD either:\n\t*\tOperates as trust (Peter's allegations lack context)\n\t*\tAppropriates funds (unjust enrichment from Daniel's platform)\n\t*\tIs abandoned by trust (Daniel has beneficial ownership)\n\tAll scenarios undermine Peter's case and expose potential misconduct by Peter and trustees.\"\n________________________________\nConclusion\nPeter's central premise regarding RWD financial allegations cannot stand without addressing fundamental questions about RWD's revenue integrity, trust structure, and payment obligations. The evidence demonstrates:\n1.\tRWD has no independent revenue capacity (no stock, no assets)\n2.\tAll sales occurred on Daniel's UK entity's platform (RegimA Zone Ltd)\n3.\tDaniel funded RWD operations continuously (R140K-R280K over 28 months)\n4.\tRWD never compensated the platform owner or distributor\n5.\tRWD paid manufacturer but not distributor (inconsistent with RSA model)\n6.\tTrust structure unclear (operates as trust or appropriates funds?)\nPeter's allegations about expenditures are inconsistent and incomplete without addressing revenue integrity.\nRecommended Actions:\n1.\tDemand Peter provide:\n*\tProof of RWD's revenue generation capacity\n*\tEvidence of payments to RegimA Zone Ltd (platform owner)\n*\tExplanation for distributor non-payment\n*\tClarification of RWD's trust structure vs. RSA\n2.\tAssert Daniel's claims:\n*\tUnjust enrichment by RWD (R2.94M - R6.88M)\n*\tBeneficial ownership of RWD (trust abandonment)\n*\tPlatform usage fees owed to RegimA Zone Ltd\n3.\tExpose Peter's inconsistencies:\n*\tQuestions expenditures but not revenues\n*\tIgnores trust structure implications\n*\tFails to address payment obligations to Daniel's entities\n4.\tChallenge RSA structure if needed:\n*\tIf RWD not a trust, is RSA's nil income filing tax fraud?\n*\tDemand consistency in trust structure treatment\n________________________________\nStatus: Critical Priority - Directly undermines Peter's central financial allegations\nImpact: Shifts burden of proof to Peter; exposes revenue integrity gaps; strengthens Daniel's ownership claims\nNext Steps: Integrate into responses to PARA 7.2-7.5, 7.6-7.11, and 10.5-10.10.23\n________________________________\nCross-Reference:\n*\tSee: PARA_7_2-7_5.md (IT Expense Allegations)\n*\tSee: PARA_7_6.md (R500K Payment)\n*\tSee: PARA_7_7-7_8.md (Payment Details)\n*\tSee: PARA_7_9-7_11.md (Payment Justification)\n*\tSee: PARA_10_5-10_10_23.md (Financial Misconduct Allegations)\n*\tSee: IT_EXPENSE_BREAKDOWN.md (Supporting Documentation)\nLast Updated: 2025-10-14\n________________________________\nFrom: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nSent: Monday, 13 October 2025 19:48\nTo: Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za>; Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za>\nCc: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>; Ian Levitt <ian@ianlevitt.co.za>\nSubject: Re: Evidence - Invoice Payments - RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd \nThese are quite important to both cases but I can't admit anything commercial that may compromise the murder investigation\n________________________________\nFrom: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nSent: Monday, 13 October 2025 18:56\nTo: Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za>; Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za>\nCc: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>; Ian Levitt <ian@ianlevitt.co.za>\nSubject: Re: Evidence - Invoice Payments - RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd\n\nhttps://github.com/cogpy/ad-res-j7 <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_cogpy_ad-2Dres-2Dj7&d=DwMGaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=7ZULBZmD5L4dM8U3nU-5WA&m=u1dW4-JS03WVDX-qi5Bh2eQrX76LtgyC-T1Psvn5qICqkCojrPnmjc4PH7IxwhvE&s=qvHOkbR-EEOyPr60wj9Fj_ptHx-NMQEunqQHRxSFsK8&e=> \n\nI'm going to load the full file directory there and the document you worked on with the required changes and the partly updated version..\nThe important thing is that the situation is completely different from how it was represented.. \nIt's nothing like a family business..

This is a significant conflict of interests. Given that I informed him (in what I understood to be his capacity as our accountant) in June 2025 of the financial fraud within the companies and furnished him with all the reports after which I requested an urgent forensic audit twice.. He said he was going away for 2 weeks. Iit now explains why he signed a supporting affidavit for Peter as we have been informed that the large transactions exceeding R5 million each was under his instruction whiole acting in his capacity as a trustee making restructuring decisions and reinvesting capital reserves.

Without this it would have zero revenue since 2023.\n\t\tThis is relevant to why it appears that Trustees hijacked their own revenue stream, extracted PII in violation of ZA POPIA and UK GDPR and instructed customers to use a new email address and \"order direct\" from now on. This is because it was never their revenue stream to begin with. The entire operation and all funds flowing through the account were always owned by Daniel Faucitt's UK company RegimA Zone Ltd.\n\t\tSo the characterization of Daniel being dependent on the company is false.

If his claims are valid then how can any revenue generated on these platforms belong to RWD?\n\nPriority: 1 - Critical\nTopic: RegimA Worldwide Distribution Revenue Legitimacy Questions\nContext: Addressing Peter's Central Premise on Financial Allegations\n________________________________\nOverview\nThis document addresses fundamental questions about RegimA Worldwide Distribution (RWD) revenue integrity that Peter must answer given his allegations about IT expenses and the R500K payment. If Peter questions RWD's expenditures, then the legitimacy and structure of RWD's revenues must similarly be subjected to scrutiny.\n________________________________\nCritical Questions Peter Must Answer\n1. RWD's Trust Structure vs. RegimA SA (RSA)\nQuestion: Does Peter claim that RegimA Worldwide Distribution operates differently to RegimA SA?\nAnalysis:\n*\t\n\tRSA Structure: RegimA SA operates with a structure where all moneys entering its bank account are held in trust for distribution to beneficiaries:\n*\t\n\tRegimA Skin Treatments (Manufacturer)\n*\t\n\tDermal Skin (Distributor)\n*\t\n\tRWD Structure: If RWD operates similarly as a trust vehicle:\n*\t\n\tRWD should hold revenues in trust for distribution to beneficiaries\n*\t\n\tRWD should not appropriate funds as its own\n*\t\n\tRWD should maintain clear accounting of trust distributions\nPeter's Inconsistency:\n*\tPeter questions RWD expenditures as if RWD owns the funds absolutely\n*\tPeter fails to acknowledge RWD's potential trust structure similar to RSA\n*\tIf RWD is a trust vehicle, then questioning individual expenditures without considering trust obligations is misleading\n________________________________\n2. RWD's Revenue Generation Capacity\nQuestion: Can Peter provide proof that RegimA Worldwide Distribution generated the revenue claimed as distinct from moneys in its bank accounts?\nKey Facts:\n*\tRWD does not hold any stock that it could sell\n*\tRWD has no inventory or physical assets to generate independent revenue\n*\tRWD cannot manufacture or distribute products directly\nRevenue Reality:\n*\tRWD issued invoices based on sales made through several stores listed on the Shopify platform\n*\tCritical Detail: The Shopify platform has been owned and paid for since July 2023 by Daniel Faucitt's independent UK entity RegimA Zone Ltd\n*\tDaniel's UK company has funded RWD operations continuously (R140K-R280K over 28 months)\nImplication: If RWD generated \"revenue,\" these were invoices for sales occurring on a platform:\n1.\tOwned by Daniel's UK entity (RegimA Zone Ltd)\n2.\tPaid for by Daniel's UK entity\n3.\tOperated by Daniel and Jacqueline\n4.\tCustomer relationships managed by Daniel's operations\n________________________________\n3. RWD's Purpose as Trust Vehicle\nQuestion: If RWD does not operate as a Trust and instead appropriates all funds moving through its accounts as its own, then what purpose does it serve as a vehicle owned by the Faucitt Family Trust?\nAnalysis:\nScenario A: RWD Operates as Trust\n*\tFunds are held in trust for distribution to beneficiaries\n*\tRWD has fiduciary obligations to beneficiaries\n*\tExpenditures must be evaluated in context of trust administration\n*\tPeter's allegations ignore trust structure and obligations\nScenario B: RWD Appropriates Funds\n*\tRWD claims all revenues as its own property\n*\tNo trust structure for distribution\n*\tQuestion: What legitimate purpose does RWD serve as a Faucitt Family Trust asset?\n*\tIf RWD operates for personal enrichment, this contradicts trust law principles\nPeter's Dilemma:\n*\tIf RWD is a trust \u2192 Peter's expenditure allegations lack context of trust obligations\n*\tIf RWD is not a trust \u2192 RWD's purpose as trust asset is questionable and potentially fraudulent\n________________________________\n4. Evidence of Payments to Revenue Source\nQuestion: Can RWD produce evidence of payments made to the entity through which customers placed orders?\nCritical Gap:\n*\tCustomers placed orders through Shopify platform owned by Daniel's UK entity (RegimA Zone Ltd)\n*\tRegimA Zone Ltd paid for the platform infrastructure ($1,000-$2,000+ USD/month)\n*\tHas RWD ever compensated RegimA Zone Ltd for:\n*\tUse of the Shopify platform?\n*\tCustomer acquisition costs?\n*\tPlatform hosting and maintenance?\n*\tTechnology infrastructure?\nPayment Flow Analysis:\nWhat Should Have Happened:\nCustomer Order (via RZ Ltd Shopify) \n \u2192 Payment to RWD \n \u2192 RWD pays platform fee to RZ Ltd\n \u2192 RWD pays manufacturer (RST)\n \u2192 RWD pays distributor (appropriate entity)\nWhat Actually Happened:\nCustomer Order (via RZ Ltd Shopify)\n \u2192 Payment to RWD\n \u2192 RWD keeps funds\n \u2192 RZ Ltd (Daniel) continues paying Shopify costs\n \u2192 No compensation to platform owner (RZ Ltd)\n________________________________\n5. Payment Discrepancy: Manufacturer vs. Distributor\nQuestion: Can RWD explain why in a similar manner to RSA it paid the Manufacturer (RST) but failed to pay the Distributor whose Customers were using the platform to place orders?\nPayment Pattern Analysis:\nRegimA SA Model:\n*\tPays RegimA Skin Treatments (Manufacturer) \u2713\n*\tPays Dermal Skin (Distributor) \u2713\n*\tBalanced trust distribution structure\nRegimA Worldwide Distribution Model:\n*\tPays RegimA Skin Treatments (Manufacturer) \u2713\n*\tFAILS to pay the Distributor (Daniel's UK entities) \u2717\n*\tFAILS to compensate platform owner (RegimA Zone Ltd) \u2717\n*\tDistributor's customers placing orders on distributor's platform\n*\tPlatform costs borne entirely by distributor (Daniel's UK company)\nCritical Question: Why was the manufacturer paid but the distributor/platform owner who:\n*\tOwned the sales platform\n*\tPaid for the sales infrastructure\n*\tManaged customer relationships\n*\tFacilitated all order processing\n...was never compensated?\n________________________________\n6. Alternative Scenario: RSA Tax Fraud\nQuestion: Alternatively, does RSA operate as a trust either, and is Peter's strategic filing of nil income for this entity tax fraud and potential theft?\nAnalysis:\nIf Peter argues RWD is NOT a trust structure, then consistency requires examining RSA:\nOption A: RSA is a legitimate trust\n*\tAll funds held in trust for distribution\n*\tNil income filing is appropriate (trust passthrough)\n*\tThen RWD should operate similarly\n*\tPeter's allegations against RWD are inconsistent\nOption B: RSA is NOT a trust\n*\tFiling nil income while receiving revenue = tax fraud\n*\tAppropriating trust funds as personal income = theft\n*\tPeter potentially guilty of:\n*\tTax evasion\n*\tBreach of fiduciary duty\n*\tMisappropriation of funds\nPeter's Catch-22:\n*\tIf RSA is a trust \u2192 RWD should be treated as trust (Peter's allegations inappropriate)\n*\tIf RSA is not a trust \u2192 Peter committed tax fraud with nil income filings\n________________________________\nLegal Implications\n1. Burden of Proof Shifts to Peter\nPeter's allegations about RWD expenditures create reciprocal obligation to prove:\n1.\tRevenue Legitimacy:\n*\tHow RWD generated revenue without stock\n*\tEvidence of actual revenue vs. invoicing for others' sales\n2.\tPayment Trail:\n*\tEvidence of payments to platform owner (RegimA Zone Ltd)\n*\tEvidence of distributor compensation\n*\tJustification for manufacturer payment but not distributor payment\n3.\tTrust Structure Consistency:\n*\tWhether RWD operates as trust like RSA\n*\tIf not, why RSA files nil income\n*\tIf yes, why trust obligations ignored in expenditure allegations\n2. Unjust Enrichment\nIf RWD appropriated revenues from Daniel's platform without compensation:\n*\tUnjust Enrichment: RWD received benefit (revenue) without payment to provider\n*\tQuantum Meruit: Daniel entitled to reasonable value of platform services\n*\tBreach of Contract: If any agreement existed for platform use\n*\tConversion: Unauthorized use of Daniel's business infrastructure\nPotential Claims:\n*\t\n\tPlatform usage fees: ~ USD150,000 (28 months of Shopify costs alone)\n*\t\n\tCustomer acquisition costs: ?\n*\t\n\tTechnology infrastructure: ?\n*\t\n\tLost profits: ?\nTotal Potential Claim: ?\n3. Trust Asset Abandonment\nEvidence of Trust Abandonment:\n1.\tNo Funding: Trust doesn't fund RWD operations\n2.\tNo Protection: Trust allowed customer hijacking (May 2025)\n3.\tNo Management: Trust didn't protect RWD assets\n4.\tDaniel's Funding: Daniel's UK entity funded all operations\nLegal Consequence:\n*\tTrust has abandoned RWD as asset\n*\tDaniel has beneficial ownership through continuous funding\n*\tTrust cannot claim asset it failed to maintain\n*\tDaniel can claim RWD ownership\n________________________________\nCross-References to Evidence\nSupporting Documentation\n1.\tRevenue Hijacking Evidence:\n*\tjax-response/revenue-theft/29-may-domain-registration/REVENUE_HIJACKING_CRIMINAL_ANALYSIS.md\n*\tSection 8: \"Connection to Trust Disputes\"\n*\tLines 700-776: RWD ownership and trust abandonment analysis\n2.\tShopify Platform Funding:\n*\tjax-response/revenue-theft/29-may-domain-registration/REVENUE_HIJACKING_CRIMINAL_ANALYSIS.md\n*\tSection 4C: \"Cost of Funding RWD Shopify\"\n*\tDaniel's UK company paid R140K-R280K for RWD platform\n3.\tPayment Redirection Scheme:\n*\tjax-response/financial-flows/01-apr-payment-redirection/README.md\n*\tR545,000+ in diverted payments\n*\tCustomer payment fraud coordinated by Rynette\n4.\tTrust Asset Diversions:\n*\tjax-response/financial-flows/README.md\n*\tR675,000+ in unauthorized trust distributions\n5.\tBusiness Destruction Evidence:\n*\tjax-response/revenue-theft/22-may-shopify-audit/README.md\n*\tRegimA SA: R1M+ monthly revenue \u2192 R0 (100% shutdown)\n*\tR3,141,647.70 in documented 3-month losses\n________________________________\nStrategic Response Framework\nFor IT Expense Allegations (PARA 7.2-7.5)\nCounter-Argument:\n\t\"Peter questions RWD's expenditures while failing to explain how RWD generated any legitimate revenue. RWD holds no stock, no inventory, and no independent revenue-generating capacity. All sales occurred on a platform owned and paid for by Daniel's UK entity (RegimA Zone Ltd) since July 2023.\n\tIf Peter questions expenditures, he must prove:\n\t1.\tHow RWD generated revenue without assets\n\t2.\tWhether RWD compensated the platform owner (Daniel's company)\n\t3.\tWhy the distributor was never paid despite facilitating all sales\n\t4.\tWhether RWD operates as a trust like RSA or appropriates funds\n\tPeter cannot have it both ways: questioning expenditures while ignoring revenue legitimacy.\"\nFor R500K Payment Allegations (PARA 7.6-7.11)\nCounter-Argument:\n\t\"Peter's allegations about a R500,000 payment ignore fundamental questions about RWD's revenue integrity. If RWD operates as a trust vehicle like RegimA SA, then the payment must be evaluated in context of trust distributions and obligations.\n\tMoreover, Peter fails to explain why:\n\t1.\tRWD paid the manufacturer (RST) but never the distributor\n\t2.\tRWD never compensated Daniel's UK entity for 28 months of platform costs\n\t3.\tRWD appropriated revenue from sales on Daniel's platform without payment\n\tThe real question is not one payment, but systematic failure to compensate the platform owner and distributor who made all RWD 'revenue' possible.\"\nFor Financial Misconduct Allegations (PARA 10.5-10.10.23)\nCounter-Argument:\n\t\"Peter's systematic financial misconduct allegations require reciprocal examination of RWD's revenue integrity. Peter must prove:\n\t1.\tRevenue Legitimacy: How RWD generated revenue without stock or assets\n\t2.\tTrust Structure: Whether RWD operates as trust or appropriates funds\n\t3.\tPayment Evidence: Proof of payments to platform owner (RegimA Zone Ltd)\n\t4.\tDistributor Compensation: Why distributor never paid despite facilitating sales\n\t5.\tRSA Consistency: If RWD is not a trust, is RSA's nil income filing tax fraud?\n\tPeter's allegations collapse under scrutiny when revenue integrity is examined. RWD either:\n\t*\tOperates as trust (Peter's allegations lack context)\n\t*\tAppropriates funds (unjust enrichment from Daniel's platform)\n\t*\tIs abandoned by trust (Daniel has beneficial ownership)\n\tAll scenarios undermine Peter's case and expose potential misconduct by Peter and trustees.\"\n________________________________\nConclusion\nPeter's central premise regarding RWD financial allegations cannot stand without addressing fundamental questions about RWD's revenue integrity, trust structure, and payment obligations. The evidence demonstrates:\n1.\tRWD has no independent revenue capacity (no stock, no assets)\n2.\tAll sales occurred on Daniel's UK entity's platform (RegimA Zone Ltd)\n3.\tDaniel funded RWD operations continuously (R140K-R280K over 28 months)\n4.\tRWD never compensated the platform owner or distributor\n5.\tRWD paid manufacturer but not distributor (inconsistent with RSA model)\n6.\tTrust structure unclear (operates as trust or appropriates funds?)\nPeter's allegations about expenditures are inconsistent and incomplete without addressing revenue integrity.\nRecommended Actions:\n1.\tDemand Peter provide:\n*\tProof of RWD's revenue generation capacity\n*\tEvidence of payments to RegimA Zone Ltd (platform owner)\n*\tExplanation for distributor non-payment\n*\tClarification of RWD's trust structure vs. RSA\n2.\tAssert Daniel's claims:\n*\tUnjust enrichment by RWD (R2.94M - R6.88M)\n*\tBeneficial ownership of RWD (trust abandonment)\n*\tPlatform usage fees owed to RegimA Zone Ltd\n3.\tExpose Peter's inconsistencies:\n*\tQuestions expenditures but not revenues\n*\tIgnores trust structure implications\n*\tFails to address payment obligations to Daniel's entities\n4.\tChallenge RSA structure if needed:\n*\tIf RWD not a trust, is RSA's nil income filing tax fraud?\n*\tDemand consistency in trust structure treatment\n________________________________\nStatus: Critical Priority - Directly undermines Peter's central financial allegations\nImpact: Shifts burden of proof to Peter; exposes revenue integrity gaps; strengthens Daniel's ownership claims\nNext Steps: Integrate into responses to PARA 7.2-7.5, 7.6-7.11, and 10.5-10.10.23\n________________________________\nCross-Reference:\n*\tSee: PARA_7_2-7_5.md (IT Expense Allegations)\n*\tSee: PARA_7_6.md (R500K Payment)\n*\tSee: PARA_7_7-7_8.md (Payment Details)\n*\tSee: PARA_7_9-7_11.md (Payment Justification)\n*\tSee: PARA_10_5-10_10_23.md (Financial Misconduct Allegations)\n*\tSee: IT_EXPENSE_BREAKDOWN.md (Supporting Documentation)\nLast Updated: 2025-10-14\n________________________________\nFrom: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nSent: Monday, 13 October 2025 19:48\nTo: Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za>; Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za>\nCc: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>; Ian Levitt <ian@ianlevitt.co.za>\nSubject: Re: Evidence - Invoice Payments - RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd \nThese are quite important to both cases but I can't admit anything commercial that may compromise the murder investigation\n________________________________\nFrom: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nSent: Monday, 13 October 2025 18:56\nTo: Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za>; Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za>\nCc: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>; Ian Levitt <ian@ianlevitt.co.za>\nSubject: Re: Evidence - Invoice Payments - RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd\n\nhttps://github.com/cogpy/ad-res-j7 <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_cogpy_ad-2Dres-2Dj7&d=DwMGaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=7ZULBZmD5L4dM8U3nU-5WA&m=u1dW4-JS03WVDX-qi5Bh2eQrX76LtgyC-T1Psvn5qICqkCojrPnmjc4PH7IxwhvE&s=qvHOkbR-EEOyPr60wj9Fj_ptHx-NMQEunqQHRxSFsK8&e=> \n\nI'm going to load the full file directory there and the document you worked on with the required changes and the partly updated version..\nThe important thing is that the situation is completely different from how it was represented.. \nIt's nothing like a family business..

This is a significant conflict of interests. Given that I informed him (in what I understood to be his capacity as our accountant) in June 2025 of the financial fraud within the companies and furnished him with all the reports after which I requested an urgent forensic audit twice.. He said he was going away for 2 weeks. Iit now explains why he signed a supporting affidavit for Peter as we have been informed that the large transactions exceeding R5 million each was under his instruction whiole acting in his capacity as a trustee making restructuring decisions and reinvesting capital reserves.

Without this it would have zero revenue since 2023.\n\t\tThis is relevant to why it appears that Trustees hijacked their own revenue stream, extracted PII in violation of ZA POPIA and UK GDPR and instructed customers to use a new email address and \"order direct\" from now on. This is because it was never their revenue stream to begin with. The entire operation and all funds flowing through the account were always owned by Daniel Faucitt's UK company RegimA Zone Ltd.\n\t\tSo the characterization of Daniel being dependent on the company is false.

Documented financial transactions prove the claims of the interdict false so I wish to say absolutely nothing else than to present the documents, explain how they refute the claims and request that the interdict be set aside as there are also ongoing criminal cases which need urgent attention as crimes are still ongoing. \nWarm Regards,\nDan\n________________________________\nFrom: Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za>\nSent: Friday, 17 October 2025 17:44\nTo: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>; Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: d@rzo.io <d@rzo.io>; Ian Levitt <ian@ianlevitt.co.za>; Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za>\nSubject: Re: FAUCITT - URGENT FEEDBACK \nHi Daniel,\nPlease can we get the comments on the document Doron and I drafted.

The challenge is mainly that the primary evidence base I have is 3 years worth of forensic evidence prepared for two parallel criminal cases and a third that I am preparing to file in the near future. As such there is a mountain of evidence from up to 7 different sources arranged specifically to meet the \"beyond reasonable doubt\" requirement along with aggressive language and claims. I think I have managed to select the most relevant pieces of evidence to refute the mistaken claims of Peter's interdict without compromising the integrity of the criminal case by exposing it to those involved.\nMy personal bank statements refute the 500k claim and the Shopify invoices demonstrate that the RegimA Worldwide revenue is actually owned and paid for by my IK entity RegimA Zone Ltd which shows how \"Worldwide\" is not a single entity but many with various international expenses all paid for by me anyway. I do not wish to attack Peter or make any derogatory statements, only to prove his mistake and ask that the interdict be set aside so that we can continue with a voluntary and collaborative forensic audit with transparency so that all checks and balances are done in the open to everyone's satisfaction.\nMy primary concerns follow as parts 2 and 3..\nThe second is the hijacking of the revenue streams by Rynette Farrar resulting in audit trails also being removed. For this matter my request is simply that the court order the reinstatement of the POPIA compliant Shopify plaforms we have used for over a decade as it was before the interference. The stores are still being paid for and awaiting order to resume. As for any damages in this regard I request only that we need to gather more evidence as this forms part of a much larger criminal case.\nThe third and final point of current concern is the covert appointment of accountant Bantjies (by Rynette Farrar who controls Peter's email address in July 2024)as a Trustee of our family trust. Mr Bantjies is the accountant, trustee, commissioner of oaths and principal debtor to both Pete and Jacqui with a sum of over R18 million coming due in May 2026. This is an extreme conflict of interests as if Mr Bantjies were to find that the entire family was declared incapacitated by dishonest medical professionals before May 2026 they would fall under the curatorship of Mr Bantjies who would no longer need to pay the debt and would also control the entire estate forever. Thus if all parties still feel it necessary given the interdict claims are disproven, regardless it must be stated - No medical testing can take place prior to the May 2026 payout and for that matter cannot take place while he is a trustee on our family trust!\nPlease see attached and below a summary of what I think is necessary for us to submit below:\n---------\nResponse Affidavit & Annexures\nOverview\nImplemented complete legal affidavits for the rescission application to set aside the ex parte interdict granted on 19 August 2025 in Case No: 2025-137857 (Dan & Jax v. Peter Faucitt).\nImplementation Summary\nThree comprehensive legal affidavits organized in  /case_2025_137857/01_court_documents/rescission_application/:\n1. Main Responding Affidavit\nEstablishes three independent grounds for setting aside the interdict (any one sufficient):\n\u00b7       Ground 1: Material Non-Disclosure - Documents 8 categories of facts Peter concealed from the Court, rendering the interdict void ab initio under the uberrima fides principle:\n\t1.\tResponsible Person regulatory crisis (R50M+ exposure, 37 jurisdictions)\n\t2.\tSettlement agreement timing (signed 8 days before interdict)\n\t3.\tInvestment payout timing (R18M due May 2026, 9 months after interdict)\n\t4.\tPeter's own disruptive actions (card cancellation, system lockout)\n\t5.\tDirector loan account structure (R500K was repayment, not gift)\n\t6.\tHistorical collaborative business model (20+ years established practice)\n\t7.\tDisproportionate harm (136:1 ratio - R68M harm vs R500K concern)\n\t8.\tTransfer of control to non-director (Rynette Farrar)\n\u00b7       Ground 2: False Factual Premises - Proves core allegations are factually incorrect:\no   R500K \"unauthorized gift\" is FALSE (was authorized director loan repayment)\no   \"UK owes SA\" claim is FALSE (UK is creditor, paid USD150,000+ for platform)\no   Third-party evidence (26+ Shopify invoices) proves payment direction: UK \u2192 SA\n\u00b7       Ground 3: Gross Disproportionality - Constitutional violation:\n\t*\t136:1 harm ratio (R68,141,648+ harm vs R500,000 concern)\n\t*\tViolates proportionality principle\n\t*\tPeter derives NO benefit (exposed to R110M+ liability)\n\n2. Supporting Affidavit - Shopify/Rynette Evidence\nDocuments platform ownership and criminal revenue hijacking:\n*\tPlatform Ownership: Third-party evidence (Shopify email 26 July 2017, 26+ invoices) proves UK entity owns and funded platform with R677,288+ investment\n*\tRevenue Hijacking: Criminal enterprise timeline showing Rynette Farrar's systematic theft:\n\t*\tCompany registration (Adderory - April 2021)\n\t*\tBank account hijacking (14 April 2025)\n\t*\tEvidence destruction (22 May 2025 - 7 days after confrontation)\n\t*\tDomain takeover, customer theft\n\t*\tTotal theft: R14,500,000+ (R97,000/day ongoing)\n*\tUrgent Relief: 48-hour platform restoration order, audit trail recovery, Adderory account freeze, forensic investigation\n\n3.

If I comment it would say on nearly every paragraph that it is untrue or misleading. That was why I drafted new documents as there was too much to change. Also I want to ensure only the facts relevant to the claims in Peter's interdict are presented without entering into arbitrary speculation about interpersonal issues or statements about opinions of competency. Documented financial transactions prove the claims of the interdict false so I wish to say absolutely nothing else than to present the documents, explain how they refute the claims and request that the interdict be set aside as there are also ongoing criminal cases which need urgent attention as crimes are still ongoing. \nWarm Regards,\nDan\n________________________________\nFrom: Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za>\nSent: Friday, 17 October 2025 17:44\nTo: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>; Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: d@rzo.io <d@rzo.io>; Ian Levitt <ian@ianlevitt.co.za>; Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za>\nSubject: Re: FAUCITT - URGENT FEEDBACK \nHi Daniel,\nPlease can we get the comments on the document Doron and I drafted.

The challenge is mainly that the primary evidence base I have is 3 years worth of forensic evidence prepared for two parallel criminal cases and a third that I am preparing to file in the near future. As such there is a mountain of evidence from up to 7 different sources arranged specifically to meet the \"beyond reasonable doubt\" requirement along with aggressive language and claims. I think I have managed to select the most relevant pieces of evidence to refute the mistaken claims of Peter's interdict without compromising the integrity of the criminal case by exposing it to those involved.\nMy personal bank statements refute the 500k claim and the Shopify invoices demonstrate that the RegimA Worldwide revenue is actually owned and paid for by my IK entity RegimA Zone Ltd which shows how \"Worldwide\" is not a single entity but many with various international expenses all paid for by me anyway. I do not wish to attack Peter or make any derogatory statements, only to prove his mistake and ask that the interdict be set aside so that we can continue with a voluntary and collaborative forensic audit with transparency so that all checks and balances are done in the open to everyone's satisfaction.\nMy primary concerns follow as parts 2 and 3..\nThe second is the hijacking of the revenue streams by Rynette Farrar resulting in audit trails also being removed. For this matter my request is simply that the court order the reinstatement of the POPIA compliant Shopify plaforms we have used for over a decade as it was before the interference. The stores are still being paid for and awaiting order to resume. As for any damages in this regard I request only that we need to gather more evidence as this forms part of a much larger criminal case.\nThe third and final point of current concern is the covert appointment of accountant Bantjies (by Rynette Farrar who controls Peter's email address in July 2024)as a Trustee of our family trust. Mr Bantjies is the accountant, trustee, commissioner of oaths and principal debtor to both Pete and Jacqui with a sum of over R18 million coming due in May 2026. This is an extreme conflict of interests as if Mr Bantjies were to find that the entire family was declared incapacitated by dishonest medical professionals before May 2026 they would fall under the curatorship of Mr Bantjies who would no longer need to pay the debt and would also control the entire estate forever. Thus if all parties still feel it necessary given the interdict claims are disproven, regardless it must be stated - No medical testing can take place prior to the May 2026 payout and for that matter cannot take place while he is a trustee on our family trust!\nPlease see attached and below a summary of what I think is necessary for us to submit below:\n---------\nResponse Affidavit & Annexures\nOverview\nImplemented complete legal affidavits for the rescission application to set aside the ex parte interdict granted on 19 August 2025 in Case No: 2025-137857 (Dan & Jax v. Peter Faucitt).\nImplementation Summary\nThree comprehensive legal affidavits organized in  /case_2025_137857/01_court_documents/rescission_application/:\n1. Main Responding Affidavit\nEstablishes three independent grounds for setting aside the interdict (any one sufficient):\n\u00b7       Ground 1: Material Non-Disclosure - Documents 8 categories of facts Peter concealed from the Court, rendering the interdict void ab initio under the uberrima fides principle:\n\t1.\tResponsible Person regulatory crisis (R50M+ exposure, 37 jurisdictions)\n\t2.\tSettlement agreement timing (signed 8 days before interdict)\n\t3.\tInvestment payout timing (R18M due May 2026, 9 months after interdict)\n\t4.\tPeter's own disruptive actions (card cancellation, system lockout)\n\t5.\tDirector loan account structure (R500K was repayment, not gift)\n\t6.\tHistorical collaborative business model (20+ years established practice)\n\t7.\tDisproportionate harm (136:1 ratio - R68M harm vs R500K concern)\n\t8.\tTransfer of control to non-director (Rynette Farrar)\n\u00b7       Ground 2: False Factual Premises - Proves core allegations are factually incorrect:\no   R500K \"unauthorized gift\" is FALSE (was authorized director loan repayment)\no   \"UK owes SA\" claim is FALSE (UK is creditor, paid USD150,000+ for platform)\no   Third-party evidence (26+ Shopify invoices) proves payment direction: UK \u2192 SA\n\u00b7       Ground 3: Gross Disproportionality - Constitutional violation:\n\t*\t136:1 harm ratio (R68,141,648+ harm vs R500,000 concern)\n\t*\tViolates proportionality principle\n\t*\tPeter derives NO benefit (exposed to R110M+ liability)\n\n2. Supporting Affidavit - Shopify/Rynette Evidence\nDocuments platform ownership and criminal revenue hijacking:\n*\tPlatform Ownership: Third-party evidence (Shopify email 26 July 2017, 26+ invoices) proves UK entity owns and funded platform with R677,288+ investment\n*\tRevenue Hijacking: Criminal enterprise timeline showing Rynette Farrar's systematic theft:\n\t*\tCompany registration (Adderory - April 2021)\n\t*\tBank account hijacking (14 April 2025)\n\t*\tEvidence destruction (22 May 2025 - 7 days after confrontation)\n\t*\tDomain takeover, customer theft\n\t*\tTotal theft: R14,500,000+ (R97,000/day ongoing)\n*\tUrgent Relief: 48-hour platform restoration order, audit trail recovery, Adderory account freeze, forensic investigation\n\n3. Supporting Affidavit - Bantjies/Medical Testing (642 lines)\nAddresses trustee conflicts and medical testing manipulation risks:\n*\tMultiple Conflicting Roles: Bantjies serves as Accountant + Trustee + Commissioner of Oaths (unacceptable concentration)\n*\tFalse Sworn Statements: Already provided false confirmatory affidavit (JF-BANTJIES1 contradicts JF-BANTJIES2)\n*\tR18M Payout at Risk: Investment due May 2026, medical testing scheduled October 2025 (7 months before payout)\n*\tManipulation Scenario: 8-step analysis showing how role concentration enables manipulation of medical testing to control R18M\n*\tCui Bono Analysis: Peter derives NO benefit; only Rynette (R97K/day theft) and Bantjies (R18M control) benefit\n*\tRelief Required: Suspend Bantjies, appoint independent trustee, delay testing until AFTER May 2026 payout, protect R18M with independent oversight\n\nKey Metrics Documented\nMetric\nAmount\nContext\nHarm Ratio\n136:1\nR68M+ harm vs R500K concern\nRevenue Theft\nR14.5M+\nRynette Farrar criminal enterprise\nDaily Theft\nR97,000\nOngoing while interdict in place\nPersonal Bleeding\nR100K/month\nDan & Jax paying from personal funds\nRegulatory Exposure\nR50M+\n37 jurisdictions, Responsible Person\nPlatform Investment\nUSD150,000+\nUK entity paid since 2023\nEvidence References\nAll evidence from the problem statement properly cited with 100+ references including:\n\u00b7       Third-party evidence: JF1 (Shopify email), DF4/DF5/DF6 (26+ invoices)\n\u00b7       Financial evidence: JF-BS1 (bank statement), JF-DLA1/2/3 (director loans), JF-PA1-4 (Peter's withdrawals)\n\u00b7       Timeline evidence: JF5 (settlement 11 Aug), JF-INVESTMENT1 (R18M May 2026), JF9 (evidence destruction 22 May)\n\u00b7       Regulatory evidence: JF-RP1/2 (37 jurisdictions, R50M+ exposure)\n\u00b7       Criminal evidence: JF-CIPC-ADDERORY, JF-BANK-CHANGE, JF-AUDIT-DESTRUCTION\n\u00b7       Trustee evidence: JF-TRUST1, JF-BANTJIES1/2, JF5-DRAFT/FINAL/COMPARISON\n\nRelief Sought\nPrimary:\n*\tSet aside ex parte interdict (19 August 2025)\n*\tCosts on attorney-and-client scale (including two counsel)\n*\tCriminal referral to NPA (perjury, fraud, theft)\nPlatform Restoration (Urgent):\n*\t48-hour order for Shopify access restoration\n*\tAudit trail recovery from Shopify backups\n*\tAdderory account freeze\n*\tForensic investigation appointment\nTrustee Protection:\n*\tBantjies suspended pending investigation\n*\tIndependent interim trustee appointed\n*\tMedical testing stayed until AFTER May 2026 payout\n*\tR18M payout protected with beneficiary consent required\n ----\nWarm Regards\nDan\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za>\nSent: Friday, October 17, 2025 16:25\nTo: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>; Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za>\nSubject: Re: FAUCITT - URGENT FEEDBACK\nDear Daniel,\nThe documents are quite difficult to follow, as they appear to have been AI-generated.

Despite my personal bank statements and various invoices demonstrating irrefutable evidence of business expenditures going off my personal card as the emergency backup payment method for services making them furthermore automatic charges - the second affidavit consists mostly of a so called medical professional diagnosing me with a gambling addiction without ever having even met me and in direct contradiction of the material facts. This shows how easily and dishonestly such broadly defined \"medical\" assessments can be. Complete fabrication and speculative lies is all it takes for such a person to get paid anyway under spurious agreements.\nOn that note my first response should be the following formal notice below or similar:\n\n\"I hereby irrevocably renounce ALL rights as beneficiary of the Faucitt Family Trust effective immediately. I want nothing from this trust. Any attempts to use trust mechanisms to control me are therefore legally void.\"\n________________________________\nFrom: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nSent: Friday, 17 October 2025 16:56\nTo: Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za>; Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>; Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nCc: d@rzo.io <d@rzo.io>; Ian Levitt <ian@ianlevitt.co.za>; Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za>\nSubject: Re: FAUCITT - URGENT FEEDBACK \nDear Natan\nI have just finished going over the various pieces of evidence to determine which are the most relevant to this civil matter. The challenge is mainly that the primary evidence base I have is 3 years worth of forensic evidence prepared for two parallel criminal cases and a third that I am preparing to file in the near future. As such there is a mountain of evidence from up to 7 different sources arranged specifically to meet the \"beyond reasonable doubt\" requirement along with aggressive language and claims. I think I have managed to select the most relevant pieces of evidence to refute the mistaken claims of Peter's interdict without compromising the integrity of the criminal case by exposing it to those involved.\nMy personal bank statements refute the 500k claim and the Shopify invoices demonstrate that the RegimA Worldwide revenue is actually owned and paid for by my IK entity RegimA Zone Ltd which shows how \"Worldwide\" is not a single entity but many with various international expenses all paid for by me anyway. I do not wish to attack Peter or make any derogatory statements, only to prove his mistake and ask that the interdict be set aside so that we can continue with a voluntary and collaborative forensic audit with transparency so that all checks and balances are done in the open to everyone's satisfaction.\nMy primary concerns follow as parts 2 and 3..\nThe second is the hijacking of the revenue streams by Rynette Farrar resulting in audit trails also being removed. For this matter my request is simply that the court order the reinstatement of the POPIA compliant Shopify plaforms we have used for over a decade as it was before the interference. The stores are still being paid for and awaiting order to resume. As for any damages in this regard I request only that we need to gather more evidence as this forms part of a much larger criminal case.\nThe third and final point of current concern is the covert appointment of accountant Bantjies (by Rynette Farrar who controls Peter's email address in July 2024)as a Trustee of our family trust. Mr Bantjies is the accountant, trustee, commissioner of oaths and principal debtor to both Pete and Jacqui with a sum of over R18 million coming due in May 2026. This is an extreme conflict of interests as if Mr Bantjies were to find that the entire family was declared incapacitated by dishonest medical professionals before May 2026 they would fall under the curatorship of Mr Bantjies who would no longer need to pay the debt and would also control the entire estate forever. Thus if all parties still feel it necessary given the interdict claims are disproven, regardless it must be stated - No medical testing can take place prior to the May 2026 payout and for that matter cannot take place while he is a trustee on our family trust!\nPlease see attached and below a summary of what I think is necessary for us to submit below:\n---------\nResponse Affidavit & Annexures\nOverview\nImplemented complete legal affidavits for the rescission application to set aside the ex parte interdict granted on 19 August 2025 in Case No: 2025-137857 (Dan & Jax v. Peter Faucitt).\nImplementation Summary\nThree comprehensive legal affidavits organized in  /case_2025_137857/01_court_documents/rescission_application/:\n1. Main Responding Affidavit\nEstablishes three independent grounds for setting aside the interdict (any one sufficient):\n\u00b7       Ground 1: Material Non-Disclosure - Documents 8 categories of facts Peter concealed from the Court, rendering the interdict void ab initio under the uberrima fides principle:\n\t1.\tResponsible Person regulatory crisis (R50M+ exposure, 37 jurisdictions)\n\t2.\tSettlement agreement timing (signed 8 days before interdict)\n\t3.\tInvestment payout timing (R18M due May 2026, 9 months after interdict)\n\t4.\tPeter's own disruptive actions (card cancellation, system lockout)\n\t5.\tDirector loan account structure (R500K was repayment, not gift)\n\t6.\tHistorical collaborative business model (20+ years established practice)\n\t7.\tDisproportionate harm (136:1 ratio - R68M harm vs R500K concern)\n\t8.\tTransfer of control to non-director (Rynette Farrar)\n\u00b7       Ground 2: False Factual Premises - Proves core allegations are factually incorrect:\no   R500K \"unauthorized gift\" is FALSE (was authorized director loan repayment)\no   \"UK owes SA\" claim is FALSE (UK is creditor, paid USD150,000+ for platform)\no   Third-party evidence (26+ Shopify invoices) proves payment direction: UK \u2192 SA\n\u00b7       Ground 3: Gross Disproportionality - Constitutional violation:\n\t*\t136:1 harm ratio (R68,141,648+ harm vs R500,000 concern)\n\t*\tViolates proportionality principle\n\t*\tPeter derives NO benefit (exposed to R110M+ liability)\n\n2. Supporting Affidavit - Shopify/Rynette Evidence\nDocuments platform ownership and criminal revenue hijacking:\n*\tPlatform Ownership: Third-party evidence (Shopify email 26 July 2017, 26+ invoices) proves UK entity owns and funded platform with R677,288+ investment\n*\tRevenue Hijacking: Criminal enterprise timeline showing Rynette Farrar's systematic theft:\n\t*\tCompany registration (Adderory - April 2021)\n\t*\tBank account hijacking (14 April 2025)\n\t*\tEvidence destruction (22 May 2025 - 7 days after confrontation)\n\t*\tDomain takeover, customer theft\n\t*\tTotal theft: R14,500,000+ (R97,000/day ongoing)\n*\tUrgent Relief: 48-hour platform restoration order, audit trail recovery, Adderory account freeze, forensic investigation\n\n3. Supporting Affidavit - Bantjies/Medical Testing (642 lines)\nAddresses trustee conflicts and medical testing manipulation risks:\n*\tMultiple Conflicting Roles: Bantjies serves as Accountant + Trustee + Commissioner of Oaths (unacceptable concentration)\n*\tFalse Sworn Statements: Already provided false confirmatory affidavit (JF-BANTJIES1 contradicts JF-BANTJIES2)\n*\tR18M Payout at Risk: Investment due May 2026, medical testing scheduled October 2025 (7 months before payout)\n*\tManipulation Scenario: 8-step analysis showing how role concentration enables manipulation of medical testing to control R18M\n*\tCui Bono Analysis: Peter derives NO benefit; only Rynette (R97K/day theft) and Bantjies (R18M control) benefit\n*\tRelief Required: Suspend Bantjies, appoint independent trustee, delay testing until AFTER May 2026 payout, protect R18M with independent oversight\n\nKey Metrics Documented\nMetric\nAmount\nContext\nHarm Ratio\n136:1\nR68M+ harm vs R500K concern\nRevenue Theft\nR14.5M+\nRynette Farrar criminal enterprise\nDaily Theft\nR97,000\nOngoing while interdict in place\nPersonal Bleeding\nR100K/month\nDan & Jax paying from personal funds\nRegulatory Exposure\nR50M+\n37 jurisdictions, Responsible Person\nPlatform Investment\nUSD150,000+\nUK entity paid since 2023\nEvidence References\nAll evidence from the problem statement properly cited with 100+ references including:\n\u00b7       Third-party evidence: JF1 (Shopify email), DF4/DF5/DF6 (26+ invoices)\n\u00b7       Financial evidence: JF-BS1 (bank statement), JF-DLA1/2/3 (director loans), JF-PA1-4 (Peter's withdrawals)\n\u00b7       Timeline evidence: JF5 (settlement 11 Aug), JF-INVESTMENT1 (R18M May 2026), JF9 (evidence destruction 22 May)\n\u00b7       Regulatory evidence: JF-RP1/2 (37 jurisdictions, R50M+ exposure)\n\u00b7       Criminal evidence: JF-CIPC-ADDERORY, JF-BANK-CHANGE, JF-AUDIT-DESTRUCTION\n\u00b7       Trustee evidence: JF-TRUST1, JF-BANTJIES1/2, JF5-DRAFT/FINAL/COMPARISON\n\nRelief Sought\nPrimary:\n*\tSet aside ex parte interdict (19 August 2025)\n*\tCosts on attorney-and-client scale (including two counsel)\n*\tCriminal referral to NPA (perjury, fraud, theft)\nPlatform Restoration (Urgent):\n*\t48-hour order for Shopify access restoration\n*\tAudit trail recovery from Shopify backups\n*\tAdderory account freeze\n*\tForensic investigation appointment\nTrustee Protection:\n*\tBantjies suspended pending investigation\n*\tIndependent interim trustee appointed\n*\tMedical testing stayed until AFTER May 2026 payout\n*\tR18M payout protected with beneficiary consent required\n ----\nWarm Regards\nDan\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za>\nSent: Friday, October 17, 2025 16:25\nTo: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>; Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za>\nSubject: Re: FAUCITT - URGENT FEEDBACK \nDear Daniel,\nThe documents are quite difficult to follow, as they appear to have been AI-generated.

This is an extreme conflict of interests as if Mr Bantjies were to find that the entire family was declared incapacitated by dishonest medical professionals before May 2026 they would fall under the curatorship of Mr Bantjies who would no longer need to pay the debt and would also control the entire estate forever. Thus if all parties still feel it necessary given the interdict claims are disproven, regardless it must be stated - No medical testing can take place prior to the May 2026 payout and for that matter cannot take place while he is a trustee on our family trust!\nPlease see attached and below a summary of what I think is necessary for us to submit below:\n---------\nResponse Affidavit & Annexures\nOverview\nImplemented complete legal affidavits for the rescission application to set aside the ex parte interdict granted on 19 August 2025 in Case No: 2025-137857 (Dan & Jax v.

The challenge is mainly that the primary evidence base I have is 3 years worth of forensic evidence prepared for two parallel criminal cases and a third that I am preparing to file in the near future. As such there is a mountain of evidence from up to 7 different sources arranged specifically to meet the \"beyond reasonable doubt\" requirement along with aggressive language and claims. I think I have managed to select the most relevant pieces of evidence to refute the mistaken claims of Peter's interdict without compromising the integrity of the criminal case by exposing it to those involved.\nMy personal bank statements refute the 500k claim and the Shopify invoices demonstrate that the RegimA Worldwide revenue is actually owned and paid for by my IK entity RegimA Zone Ltd which shows how \"Worldwide\" is not a single entity but many with various international expenses all paid for by me anyway. I do not wish to attack Peter or make any derogatory statements, only to prove his mistake and ask that the interdict be set aside so that we can continue with a voluntary and collaborative forensic audit with transparency so that all checks and balances are done in the open to everyone's satisfaction.\nMy primary concerns follow as parts 2 and 3..\nThe second is the hijacking of the revenue streams by Rynette Farrar resulting in audit trails also being removed. For this matter my request is simply that the court order the reinstatement of the POPIA compliant Shopify plaforms we have used for over a decade as it was before the interference. The stores are still being paid for and awaiting order to resume. As for any damages in this regard I request only that we need to gather more evidence as this forms part of a much larger criminal case.\nThe third and final point of current concern is the covert appointment of accountant Bantjies (by Rynette Farrar who controls Peter's email address in July 2024)as a Trustee of our family trust.

Please let me know if you can open this then I will format the others similarly and send.\nWarm Regards\nDan\n________________________________\nFrom: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>\nSent: Wednesday, 15 October 2025 19:34\nTo: Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za>; Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: Ian Levitt <ian@ianlevitt.co.za>; Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za>\nSubject: Re: FAUCITT - URGENT FEEDBACK\nIt's nearly done with each AD processed and a series of notes 90% there i'm just cross-referencing the response paras with the notes and annexures will send through soon.\nWarm Regards,\nDan \n________________________________\nFrom: Natan Back <Natan@ianlevitt.co.za>\nSent: Wednesday, 15 October 2025 18:38\nTo: Daniel Faucitt <dan@regima.com>; Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nCc: Ian Levitt <ian@ianlevitt.co.za>; Doron Block <block@rivoniaadvocates.co.za>\nSubject: FAUCITT - URGENT FEEDBACK\nDear Jacqui and Daniel,\nWe have sent our draft for consideration over a week ago.

UK00914297063 REGIMA ZONE in classes 03, 05 and 44 in the name of REGIMA SKIN TREATMENTS CC [Witz ref: CS2511.UK.03+]\n\nDear Jacqui\n\nThank you for your email.\n\nWe note that you are no longer interested in the REGIMA ZONE mark in the EU and confirm that we will take no further action and allow the EU trade mark registration for REGIMA ZONE to lapse without incurring any further costs.\n\nPlease will you confirm whether you are still interested in maintaining UK Trade mark registration nos. UK00914297063 REGIMA ZONE in classes 03, 05 and 44.\n\nThe costs involved in renewing the REGIMA ZONE registrations in the UK for a further 10 years (calculated from the abovementioned renewal date, even if the renewal is filed before this date) will be in the region of R23,900 (including VAT, agents fees, disbursements and official fees). Please note that the cost is an estimate only, as it is subject to constant exchange rate fluctuations. \n\nIf you are still interested in maintaining the REGIMA ZONE mark in the UK, we will require a R13, 000 deposit in our trust account to cover our agents\u2019 fees and disbursements in the UK.

If you, therefore, require protection in both the 27 EU member states and the UK then you have to renew the trade mark in both jurisdictions. Put differently, the UK registration is now a completely separate registration with its own life in a separate country and if you require continued protection in the UK, you have to renew that separately. If you require continued protection in the EU and its 27 member states, then you also have to renew the EU registration.\n\nWe trust that this clarifies the matter.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJuanita Stolk\n\nPartner\n\nm. +27 (0)83 660 8991\n\t| \n\tt. +27 (0)11 010 0400 \n\nf. +27 (0)86 674 7468 \n\t| \n\te. juanita@witzinc.co.za <mailto:juanita@witzinc.co.za>  \n\nwww.witzinc.co.za <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.witzinc.co.za_&d=DwMGaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=7ZULBZmD5L4dM8U3nU-5WA&m=hqP1Aj5GC6BHwBLjgG0gkgAtTnqqh2yidk_z5eEmfXOwYGwpzvISxL9X7rUbOFzp&s=SvFI-bYqMlCp-UY6_oVIRItwa3tUGsN6qWJQZ73awr4&e=>  \n\t| \n\tPO Box 412104, Craighall, 2024 \n\n1st Floor, The Conservatory, 13 Baker Street, Rosebank \n\nNOTICE: This document and any attachments hereto are intended only for the addressee and contains information that is subject to legal privilege and confidential or otherwise protected from disclosure.

If you, therefore, require protection in both the 27 EU member states and the UK then you have to renew the trade mark in both jurisdictions. Put differently, the UK registration is now a completely separate registration with its own life in a separate country and if you require continued protection in the UK, you have to renew that separately. If you require continued protection in the EU and its 27 member states, then you also have to renew the EU registration.\n\nWe trust that this clarifies the matter.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJuanita Stolk\n\nPartner\n\nm. +27 (0)83 660 8991\n\t| \n\tt. +27 (0)11 010 0400 \n\nf. +27 (0)86 674 7468 \n\t| \n\te. juanita@witzinc.co.za <mailto:juanita@witzinc.co.za>  \n\nwww.witzinc.co.za <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.witzinc.co.za_&d=DwMGaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=7ZULBZmD5L4dM8U3nU-5WA&m=JfjckV7CF9N7aVC9_SOBihBMi5_wZGImcmZhNJsIhbhnolEtvH36MHDtkkUWYAmq&s=PbjqDaC0DgCzM8w0c2NpGd0U3xdYoOFNPNg_qu5aEYk&e=>  \n\t| \n\tPO Box 412104, Craighall, 2024 \n\n1st Floor, The Conservatory, 13 Baker Street, Rosebank \n\nNOTICE: This document and any attachments hereto are intended only for the addressee and contains information that is subject to legal privilege and confidential or otherwise protected from disclosure.

Unfortunately, European attorneys are expensive and the cost are further magnified by the Rand/Pound exchange rate (more than R25 to the Pound as of this morning).\n\nPlease let us know if you are happy to proceed with the renewal.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you.\n\nKind regards,\n\nJuanita Stolk\n\nPartner\n\nm. +27 (0)83 660 8991\n\t| \n\tt. +27 (0)11 010 0400 \n\nf. +27 (0)86 674 7468 \n\t| \n\te. juanita@witzinc.co.za <mailto:juanita@witzinc.co.za>  \n\nwww.witzinc.co.za <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.witzinc.co.za_&d=DwMGaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=7ZULBZmD5L4dM8U3nU-5WA&m=JfjckV7CF9N7aVC9_SOBihBMi5_wZGImcmZhNJsIhbhnolEtvH36MHDtkkUWYAmq&s=PbjqDaC0DgCzM8w0c2NpGd0U3xdYoOFNPNg_qu5aEYk&e=>  \n\t| \n\tPO Box 412104, Craighall, 2024 \n\n1st Floor, The Conservatory, 13 Baker Street, Rosebank \n\nNOTICE: This document and any attachments hereto are intended only for the addressee and contains information that is subject to legal privilege and confidential or otherwise protected from disclosure.

UK00914297063 REGIMA ZONE in classes 03, 05 and 44 in the name of REGIMA SKIN TREATMENTS CC [Witz ref: CS2511.UK.03+]\nHi Jacqui,\n\nI have spoken to Shenaaz and agree that it is incredibly important that we don\u2019t do anything that would be in breach of the settlement agreement. We will certainly take action against Rynette and her son at the appropriate time and in the interim, my partner Andrew is collating the evidence against them. However, the timing is important and we do not believe it is prudent to act in haste and potentially jeopardise our strategy going forward.\n\nIf you are able to collate the evidence of what they are doing it will be incredibly valuable in our case against them (and also to Shenaaz\u2019s side of the matter as well). \n\nAs discussed on the phone on Friday, I implore you not to take matters into your own hands as it could result in serious set-backs to our position. It must be borne in mind that they still have a court order against you and we need to maneuver very carefully. Any mis-step (from either side) could have far-reaching consequences. \n\nAs always, I am happy to discuss further. \n\nBest,\n\nCraig\n\nFrom: Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone <mailto:jax@regima.zone> >\nDate: Friday, 19 September 2025 at 17:47\nTo: Craig Shapiro <cshapiro@ensafrica.com <mailto:cshapiro@ensafrica.com> >\nCc: Daniel J.

UK00914297063 REGIMA ZONE in classes 03, 05 and 44.\n\nThe costs involved in renewing the REGIMA ZONE registrations in the UK for a further 10 years (calculated from the abovementioned renewal date, even if the renewal is filed before this date) will be in the region of R23,900 (including VAT, agents fees, disbursements and official fees). Please note that the cost is an estimate only, as it is subject to constant exchange rate fluctuations. \n\nIf you are still interested in maintaining the REGIMA ZONE mark in the UK, we will require a R13, 000 deposit in our trust account to cover our agents\u2019 fees and disbursements in the UK.  Please note that this is not cover for our fees (we will send you a reconciled invoice reflecting our fees, your deposit and the actual disbursements once we have made the international foreign currency payments and the bank has provided us with the actual Rand equivalent); you are a valued existing client with an impeccable payment record, so please do not feel offended at all.  This is simply an internal rule that is outside our control, as we have to take cover for substantial disbursements (the foreign agents will invoice our firm, we are responsible for payment to them, and we have to settle their accounts promptly).  \n\nYou have our banking details but please let us know if you need any other paperwork from our side to enable you to pay the deposit into our trust account, using our reference CS2511 / MR000559.  Although we will pick the payment up on our bank statement, please send us an e-mail when you deposit the money so that we can specifically look out for it and allocate it to your matter.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in maintaining the mark, we can allow it to lapse without incurring any costs.\n\nLet us know if you have any questions.\n\nKind regards,\n\nJuanita Stolk\n\nPartner\n\nm. +27 (0)83 660 8991\n\t| \n\tt. +27 (0)11 010 0400 \n\nf. +27 (0)86 674 7468 \n\t| \n\te. juanita@witzinc.co.za <mailto:juanita@witzinc.co.za>  \n\nwww.witzinc.co.za <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.witzinc.co.za_&d=DwMGaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=7ZULBZmD5L4dM8U3nU-5WA&m=eEkLRkf-ml9xLFke_PyzFyealept1PQSXFwK63pGvcdZIb64zBKmB4x9S6e-3KB4&s=Hf-OAV_PWYt6imTURn2T3SfwSMgdolu3OkZaU1pDEss&e=>  \n\t| \n\tPO Box 412104, Craighall, 2024 \n\n1st Floor, The Conservatory, 13 Baker Street, Rosebank \n\nNOTICE: This document and any attachments hereto are intended only for the addressee and contains information that is subject to legal privilege and confidential or otherwise protected from disclosure.

UK00914297063 REGIMA ZONE in classes 03, 05 and 44.\n\nAs part of our firm\u2019s policy, we will require a R47, 000 deposit in our trust account to cover our agents\u2019 fees and disbursements in the UK and the EU.  Please note that this is not cover for our fees (we will send you a reconciled invoice reflecting our fees, your deposit and the actual disbursements once we have made the international foreign currency payments and the bank has provided us with the actual Rand equivalent); you are a valued existing client with an impeccable payment record, so please do not feel offended at all.  This is simply an internal rule that is outside our control, as we have to take cover for substantial disbursements (the foreign agents will invoice our firm, we are responsible for payment to them, and we have to settle their accounts promptly).  \n\nYou have our banking details but please let us know if you need any other paperwork from our side to enable you to pay the deposit into our trust account, using our reference CS2511 / MR000559.  Although we will pick the payment up on our bank statement, please send us an e-mail when you deposit the money so that we can specifically look out for it and allocate it to your matter.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in maintaining the marks, we can allow them to lapse without incurring any costs.\n\nLet us know if you have any questions.\n\nKind regards,\n\nJuanita Stolk\n\nPartner\n\nm. +27 (0)83 660 8991\n\t| \n\tt. +27 (0)11 010 0400 \n\nf. +27 (0)86 674 7468 \n\t| \n\te. juanita@witzinc.co.za <mailto:juanita@witzinc.co.za>  \n\nwww.witzinc.co.za <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.witzinc.co.za_&d=DwMGaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=7ZULBZmD5L4dM8U3nU-5WA&m=eEkLRkf-ml9xLFke_PyzFyealept1PQSXFwK63pGvcdZIb64zBKmB4x9S6e-3KB4&s=Hf-OAV_PWYt6imTURn2T3SfwSMgdolu3OkZaU1pDEss&e=>  \n\t| \n\tPO Box 412104, Craighall, 2024 \n\n1st Floor, The Conservatory, 13 Baker Street, Rosebank \n\nNOTICE: This document and any attachments hereto are intended only for the addressee and contains information that is subject to legal privilege and confidential or otherwise protected from disclosure.

If you, therefore, require protection in both the 27 EU member states and the UK then you have to renew the trade mark in both jurisdictions. Put differently, the UK registration is now a completely separate registration with its own life in a separate country and if you require continued protection in the UK, you have to renew that separately. If you require continued protection in the EU and its 27 member states, then you also have to renew the EU registration.\n\nWe trust that this clarifies the matter.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJuanita Stolk\n\nPartner\n\nm. +27 (0)83 660 8991\n\t| \n\tt. +27 (0)11 010 0400 \n\nf. +27 (0)86 674 7468 \n\t| \n\te. juanita@witzinc.co.za <mailto:juanita@witzinc.co.za>  \n\nwww.witzinc.co.za <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.witzinc.co.za_&d=DwMGaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=7ZULBZmD5L4dM8U3nU-5WA&m=eEkLRkf-ml9xLFke_PyzFyealept1PQSXFwK63pGvcdZIb64zBKmB4x9S6e-3KB4&s=Hf-OAV_PWYt6imTURn2T3SfwSMgdolu3OkZaU1pDEss&e=>  \n\t| \n\tPO Box 412104, Craighall, 2024 \n\n1st Floor, The Conservatory, 13 Baker Street, Rosebank \n\nNOTICE: This document and any attachments hereto are intended only for the addressee and contains information that is subject to legal privilege and confidential or otherwise protected from disclosure.

Please note that the cost is an estimate only, as it is subject to constant exchange rate fluctuations. \n\nThe vast majority of these costs are made up by our EU agent\u2019s fees and disbursements. Unfortunately, European attorneys are expensive and the cost are further magnified by the Rand/Pound exchange rate (more than R25 to the Pound as of this morning).\n\nPlease let us know if you are happy to proceed with the renewal.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you.\n\nKind regards,\n\nJuanita Stolk\n\nPartner\n\nm. +27 (0)83 660 8991\n\t| \n\tt. +27 (0)11 010 0400 \n\nf. +27 (0)86 674 7468 \n\t| \n\te. juanita@witzinc.co.za <mailto:juanita@witzinc.co.za>  \n\nwww.witzinc.co.za <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.witzinc.co.za_&d=DwMGaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=7ZULBZmD5L4dM8U3nU-5WA&m=eEkLRkf-ml9xLFke_PyzFyealept1PQSXFwK63pGvcdZIb64zBKmB4x9S6e-3KB4&s=Hf-OAV_PWYt6imTURn2T3SfwSMgdolu3OkZaU1pDEss&e=>  \n\t| \n\tPO Box 412104, Craighall, 2024 \n\n1st Floor, The Conservatory, 13 Baker Street, Rosebank \n\nNOTICE: This document and any attachments hereto are intended only for the addressee and contains information that is subject to legal privilege and confidential or otherwise protected from disclosure.

Would they need to get an advocate to go to court for the condonation?  The more pressure on Clark the better, and if her attorney has screwed up a bit on her behalf then more the better.  We can wait it out, she may struggle to do that.\n\nThe plea is nonsense, what are your thoughts and angles?\n\nPete has said that the Kachan one is the one we want to nail asap.\n\nCheers Dave\n\nJax & Pete\n\nFrom: Rynette Farrar <rynette@regima.zone> \nSent: Thursday, 29 September 2022 12:01 PM\nTo: Daniel Faucitt <d@rzo.io>\nCc: JAX@REGIMA.COM; PETE@REGIMA.COM; Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone>\nSubject: FW: REGIMA SKIN TREATMENTS CC // TRACEY CLARK - CASE NUMBER: 10664/2022\n\nFrom: David Bayliss <davidbayliss@mweb.co.za <mailto:davidbayliss@mweb.co.za> > \nSent: Thursday, 29 September 2022 11:44\nTo: PETE@regima.com <mailto:PETE@regima.com> ; Jacqui Faucitt <jax@regima.zone <mailto:jax@regima.zone> >\nCc: Kayla Pretorius <kayla@regima.zone <mailto:kayla@regima.zone> >; Rynette Farrar <rynette@regima.zone <mailto:rynette@regima.zone> >\nSubject: Fwd: REGIMA SKIN TREATMENTS CC // TRACEY CLARK - CASE NUMBER: 10664/2022\n\nHello Pete and Jax\n\nHerewith as received this morning.\n\nThe plea is one day late after the service of our notice of bar.\n\nI await your instructions but my advice is that we should allow the matter to proceed and deal with the merits.\n\nIf I take the point that they are one day late Warrener will have to bring an application to condone his late filing (which I believe will be successful in these times where almost anything is condoned).
