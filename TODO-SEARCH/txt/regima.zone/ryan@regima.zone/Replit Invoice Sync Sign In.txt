Subject:	Replit Invoice Sync Sign In

Dear Danny,
I hope this email finds you well!
I am unable to open the Replit deployment for the invoice sync app. Is it possible to register ryan@regima.zone to gain access to the deployment sent via echo on Slack? Furthermore, the IO email has now completely ceased to work. I thought it would be important to bring this to your attention because when I open the IO account on Google Chrome my computer freezes. When trying another desktop it gives me an error message. This is strange indeed. 
Hopefully, the .zone email will suffice for now?
I hope all is well with this crazy weather, It seems like we've had all four seasons in one day!
Kind Regards,
Ryan
