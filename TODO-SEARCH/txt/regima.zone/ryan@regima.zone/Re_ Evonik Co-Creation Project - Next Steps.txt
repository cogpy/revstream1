Dear John,
Thank you for your message and the clear direction ahead of our meeting on 14 August. I’m also looking forward to reviewing the clinical results on the Ximenia Oil Natucera® Complex, hopefully they confirm its potential in atopic skin care! Fingers crossed!
I’ll start looking into suitable emulsifier and preservative systems from Dr. Straetmans, and have a few ideas forming already. I’ll also reach out to Jacques for the most recent Evonik catalogue.
In terms of preservation, I’ll aim to cover protection against common pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans, while also considering how best to support and preserve the skin’s natural microbiome.
On a separate note, I came across a promising role for bisabolol in eczema care last night, which I believe could complement the Ximenia Complex well. I’ll include that in my next set of notes.
Please let me know if there’s anything else you'd like me to prioritise and as always, please take care and have a wonderful, hopefully sunny, day!
Kind Regards,
Ryan

Subject: Evonik Co-Creation Project - Next Steps 

Dear Ryan,

Thank you for all the research that you have conducted in the past few weeks, we have made significant progress in that time as we prepare for our next meeting with Evonik, scheduled for the 14th August.

One of the main topics on the 14th August will be the Ximenia Oil Natucera® Complex and how effective it might be on the treatment of atopic skin conditions, following the clinical work that Evonik have conducted over the past few months – we wait with bated breath!

From our perspective, as RégimA Medic, we will start investigating the formulation phase, assuming that the Ximenia Oil Natucera® Complex has been successful in Evonik’s clinical trials.  As such, I think that the focus of the research we should conduct in the run-up to our next meeting with Evonik should include the following:

*	Emulsifier systems – it is most likely that nonionic emulsifier systems will be the most suitable for use on atopic skin conditions.  As a first step, I would suggest that we research emulsifiers from Dr. Straetmans which, ironically, was a company purchased by Evonik a few years back.
*	Preservative systems – once again Dr. Straetmans would be my company of choice.  Preservation is going to be a real challenge, as we need to ensure a high degree of microbiological integrity, whilst keeping irritation potential as low as possible, given that we are dealing with atopic skin conditions.

In respect of both of the above, I have attached a product catalogue from Evonik as a reference document.  It is a little dated (2020) I am afraid, but I am sure that Jacques can provide you with the latest Evonik catalogue if you contact him?

Ryan, hopefully this is enough to be going on with, but if you require any further guidance from me, please don’t hesitate to revert? 

Warmest regards,

John
