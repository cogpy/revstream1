This letter is significant as that money is still owing and Rynette has made it disappear.  Rynette has no authority to speak for DANIEL or JACQUELINE and ignores requests to explain where the monies went?

Subject: Rezonance - Unicorn - Joziway

Hi Clare

Hope you are well. Please note the information you are being given about my companies is inaccurate. See below and attached for clarification.

All of the accounts for all companies are complete. They have been all along but have not been submitted yet due to the pending contention regarding unpaid amounts from RegimA Skin Treatments. see attachment "Rezonance Febr 2023.PDF" indicating R1,035,361.34 still outstanding at that point in time. In addition I have raised issue with subsequent records of payments allegedly made to Rezonance since Rynette added these payments to RegimA accounts clearing the full amount but such payments never appeared in the Rezonance account so the question is who were these payments made to? This raises complications in Kayla's estate with the ongoing murder investigation still in process. Moreover Rynette is aware that the accounts are complete but obviously removing Kayla and deregistering the companies removes certain questions regarding the suspicious payments. This is a clear conflict of interests and I have asked Rynette on multiple occasions to cease repeated attempts to speak on my behalf and potentially do damage to my companies.

I have never and will never consent to anyone speaking on my behalf. Thus please communicate with me directly regarding my company affairs and never share my company information with Rynette, who is neither a director or employee of the companies, at any time for any reason. With that said, please find attached the tentative annual accounts for Rezonance, noting that the most recent 2 periods need correction once the dispute regarding payments is resolved. I will send Unicorn ASAP and Joziway is still dormant. Until these conflicts are resolved I need to ensure that nothing is deregistered so whatever is necessary just let me know so I can also keep Kayla's family and the investigating officers in the criminal case aware of current status.

If there is anything else you need please let me know at dan@regima.com <mailto:dan@regima.com>  and please confirm receipt of this email as the spam mailboxes are preventing many from getting through these days.

Warm Regards
Dan

Good afternoon Clare

If CIPC, which I think they are going to do, de-register the companies, then it will have to be.

It will take a while for this accountant to get all Danny’s company’s books up to date.  If CIPC de-register and Danny still want to keep them going, we will have to follow the process to get them reinstated again.

What needs to be done in order to remove Kayla as director?

Regards

Hi Ladies

This is where the problem comes in – Kayla is a shareholder!  When I submit the beneficial ownership, I can only disclose Danny as we cannot disclose an Estate Late.

Danny’s books for both companies are not done for these years.  We got someone who will move onto these books once RegimA SA’s books are done. Do you not have estimates of annual turnover, I am concerned that the CIPC will deregister the company.

Regards

Good morning Clare

Danny’s books for both companies are not done for these years.  We got someone who will move onto these books once RegimA SA’s books are done.

I do not have anything on Jozi Way, so I will contact the attorney who did all Danny’s companies paperwork before, to get it from them.

I have attached so long for you the CIPC docs, share certificates etc. for Unicorn.

Regards
