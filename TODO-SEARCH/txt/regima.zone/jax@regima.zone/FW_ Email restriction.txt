Good morning Jax,
I hope you’re well. We’ve tried to unblock my email claire@regima.zone <mailto:claire@regima.zone>  but apparently some higher security settings have been applied, which means I can’t receive any emails. Are you able to pass this on to someone that can assist please as we unable able to fix it our end.  I can send emails but not receive. Thanks in advance.
