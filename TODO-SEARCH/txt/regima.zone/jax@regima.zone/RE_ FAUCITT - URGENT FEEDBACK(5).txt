Subject:	RE: FAUCITT - URGENT FEEDBACK 

Hi Natan & Doron

It would be possible to meet on Monday, but in the meantime we really need to submit that my role as The Responsible Person for all these countries is an official position and so I have a critical role that the interdict is stopping me performing.  Please can you separate the roles Daniel and I hold so you fight to get the interdicts set aside to allow me to work as the companies will be destroyed without me?

Dear Natan and Doron

I did read all the documents Daniel sent through. Please would you submit the statement that I, Jacqueline Faucitt am the responsible person, so it is critical that I am allowed back in my office and my role for the 27 entities.  There is nobody else in my offices who is qualified to take my role.  The interdict is going to cripple our companies, please help.

Jacqui

Importance: High

Dear Daniel,

The documents are quite difficult to follow, as they appear to have been AI-generated. I understand that you don’t typically work in Microsoft Word, but the affidavit was prepared in Word specifically so that you could insert your comments and amendments directly into the document using track changes.

This matter has become increasingly urgent, and I am growing quite concerned. Would it be possible for you to meet with Doron and me sometime next week to go through everything together?

Kind regards,

Dear Natan

I don't use Word or anything outside of coding so I did the content and i've been struggling for 24 hours to try and render the markdown into your original document with algorithmic processors.. If I spend any longer on the formatting there will be nothing so it seems we need someone who is able to help with formatting documents how you need them. I can generate markdown and convert to pdf & docx but to actually recover the original formatting requires using the actual word program.

Anyway the best I can do is send the docx versions I have with the AD headers. Please let me know if you can open this then I will format the others similarly and send.

Warm Regards
Dan

Dear Jacqui and Daniel,

We have sent our draft for consideration over a week ago. We have not received the draft back with comments and we are very concerned as this is getting further delayed.  

Please urgently send the draft with comments and accompanying annexures as originally requested, along with the detailed note requested on the relevance of documents provided. We will not be in a position to assist unless this is sent. 

Please treat this as urgent.

Kind regards,
