## **SPECULATIVE STATEMENT ABOUT KEY TIMELINE PATTERNS**

**"This timeline reveals activity indicative of possible criminal conspiracy starting on or before June 10, 2025, when accountant Bantjies identified R10 million missing but refused to investigate after learning about possible connections to misappropriated funds related to Kayla's 2023 murder. He then gave a mistaken/perjured affidavit supporting the thief. ENS Africa received proof on August 29 but concealed it, forcing us into a fraudulent settlement under duress in September by informing us that it was a pre-condition for mediation while telling us to 'be quiet' about murder and death threats, saying any SAPS would do nothing and the next court date would be 2029 so it was the only choice we had. Every document is void due to fraud. Following the interdict there was a significant escalation where serious financial crimes with intent to force all the companies into insolvency by emptying bank accounts and defaulting on creditors. In addition we discovered between 22-29 Sep several fraudulent tax returns either submitted or being prepared to be submitted by Rynette Farrar without our knowledge. New evidence is still being uncovered on a daily basis."**
