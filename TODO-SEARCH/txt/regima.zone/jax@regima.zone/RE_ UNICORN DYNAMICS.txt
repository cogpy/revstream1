Hi Clare

I know these will take some time for him to get as he will need to make contact with Kayla’s mother again after a very long time.  Sorry.  Jacqui

Hi Dan

I attach the statutory register for your records.

We need to advise the CIPC of the passing of Kayla and remove her as a director.  In order that I may prepare the necessary documents, I require the following:
*	Death Certificate
*	Letter of Executorship

Regards

Subject: Unicorn & Joziway

Good morning Clare

Danny’s books for both companies are not done for these years.  We got someone who will move onto these books once RegimA SA’s books are done.

I do not have anything on Jozi Way, so I will contact the attorney who did all Danny’s companies paperwork before, to get it from them.

I have attached so long for you the CIPC docs, share certificates etc. for Unicorn.

Regards
