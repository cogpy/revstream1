Subject:	ARE YOU ABLE TO OPPOSE PART A OF THE EXPARTE INTERDICT, THE FIRST ONE

AS A MATTER OF GREAT URGENCY ARE YOU ABLE TO OPPOSE PART A OF THE EXPARTE INTERDICT.  THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE WANTED FROM THE START.  WE HAVE SENT THROUGH SO MUCH EVIDENCE OF PERJURY  FROM BANTJIES, THE ACCOUNTANT WHO  DID A SUPPORTING AFFIDAVIT, TO PETER'S LYING AFFIDAVIT, BESIDES ALL THE LIES AND FRAUD, FROM THE BOOKKEEPER WITH THE REPEATED FRAUD.    PETER IS OBVIOUSLY HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH RYNETTE FARRAR, CONDOM, EVIDENCE  HE IS FOR SOME REASON DEPENDING ON HER AND TOGETHER THEY ARE FRAUDULENTLY TAKING OUR MONEY.
PLEASE LET US KNOW AS A MATTER OF URGENCY IF YOU CAN OPPOSE THE PART A OF THE EXPARTE FIRST INTERDICT TO GET IT SET ASIDE.  CAN YOU LET US KNOW THIS MORNING.  ANOTHER MEETING TO DISCUSS ANY OTHER MATTERS IS NOT GOING TO HELP UNLESS WE CAN GET THIS SORTE OUT VERY URGENTLY.
