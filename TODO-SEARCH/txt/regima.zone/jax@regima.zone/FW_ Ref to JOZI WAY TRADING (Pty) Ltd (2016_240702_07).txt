Dear Directors/Members,
RE- Final reminder to file Beneficial Ownership and Securities Register declarations
Since 24 May 2023, it has been mandatory in terms of the Companies Act (as amended) for all companies, external companies and close corporations to file their Beneficial Ownership/Securities Register information or declarations annually with their annual return submission, or as and when it changes.
The Commission urges all non-compliant companies to file their BO information and not to wait for the filing of the annual returns anniversary period. Newly registered entities must file BO information and securities registers within 10 (ten) business days after the date of incorporation.
In August and September 2024, the Commission issued your company an email notification requesting you to file BO information within 7 (seven) business days respectively. If your company has not filed to date, your company is non-compliant with the Companies Act, and will be issued with a compliance notice upon expiry of the 7 business days referred to above . Once you receive the compliance notice , you have 15 (fifteen) business days to comply, to avoid endorsement of your disclosure certificate where your BO non-compliance will be visible to third parties. Failure to comply may also lead to a court sanctioned administrative fine and/or criminal prosecution.
Please ignore this notification if you have already filed your BO information.
The filing of Beneficial Ownership declarations can be done independently on e-services and non-compliant entities should therefore not wait until their annual return submissions are due to file the outstanding BO information.
For guidance on how to file the BO declaration, please visit the website for step-by-step guides: https://www.cipc.co.za/?page_id=4447 <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.cipc.co.za_-3Fpage-5Fid-3D4447&d=DwMFAg&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=7ZULBZmD5L4dM8U3nU-5WA&m=5pv4HBcRYsZVa39KesmtZg8MM9XtNyhnP6gXLXHcmC1NH1kjcWo3OTPXP-TBjCBK&s=EBwTV2Zo1wggW9WYyM_st3goV7q4sem3cCHxYiDQMz0&e=>
