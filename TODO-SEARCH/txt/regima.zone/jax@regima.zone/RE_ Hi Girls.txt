Hello,

We are just looking at the EE bill and I wanted to check if Dan still uses the following numbers:

07415467592 £97.91 ex VAT        
07539291103 £89.92 ex VAT

These are quote pricey considering they are both out of contract and haven't been renewed. If he still uses them then we could reduce them down to around £20 a month on sim only.

Warm regards

Morning,

Hope all is well. I'm not sure exactly what you need, but I have attached our year end accounts for the last few years, so hopefully this is helpful. 
Is there anything else I can send over? 

Have you looked at our shopify? There are around 40 channels on there and the monthly bill is very high. I'm not sure if this can be reduced as we only need to zone and Europe one on our end. I've attached an invoice for you to see.

Warm regards
