Morning,

Hope all is well. I'm not sure exactly what you need, but I have attached our year end accounts for the last few years, so hopefully this is helpful. 
Is there anything else I can send over? 

Have you looked at our shopify? There are around 40 channels on there and the monthly bill is very high. I'm not sure if this can be reduced as we only need to zone and Europe one on our end. I've attached an invoice for you to see.

Warm regards

Please could you let us have print outs of the accounts/ books. Pete is demanding them.  Thanks
