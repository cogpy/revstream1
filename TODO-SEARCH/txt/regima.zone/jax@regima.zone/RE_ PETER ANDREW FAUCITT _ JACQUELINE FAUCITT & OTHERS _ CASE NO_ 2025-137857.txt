Hi Nate this is one of their delay tactics yet again.    If you write to them please add that PETER had my UK state pension directed into his LLOYDS account without my knowledge or consent.  I want it back.  Peter has allowed the bookkeeper to handle ALL the FAUCITT money since August.  When I want to see my money back in the bank he ignores me and gets the bookkeeper to send me bank statements with all the funds transferred into investment but none Danny and I can access.and the US and EURO accounts are now non-existent.

PRICE INCREASE this is usually done over a couple of weeks at least where Danny checks and carefully goes back and forth.  This has been done so badly and without any knowledge of REGIMA, clients already complaining that this will finish the business.
