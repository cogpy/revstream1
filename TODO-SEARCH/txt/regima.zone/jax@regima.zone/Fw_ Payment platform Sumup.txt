Hey,
It does say passport or ID license so that would be great. If not I can send login details so he could login and do it himself. Whatever he is happiest with.
Warm regards

Hello,
We have been having issues with PayPal for a while now as payments are being declined but Paypal are saying there isn't an issue on their side. Customers are becoming annoyed as it is something that we should offer for payment options. A lot of people pay on credit cards so cannot do a bank transfer. I tried setting up Sum-up instead to take payments as a backup platform as it is free and the rates are cheaper for us. The app needs a verification from you Dan. Is this something you can help me with Pleasee.
Warm regards
