Hi 
Clare

Danny managed to get Kayla’s death certificate.  He does not want to lose UNICORN.  This is not to be passed onto Rynette for their attorney.  Danny would. Like me to take over Kayla’s shares.  I will send the death certificate when I see Danny today.  Please not share this information with Pete or Rynette.

Hi Ladies

This is where the problem comes in – Kayla is a shareholder!  When I submit the beneficial ownership, I can only disclose Danny as we cannot disclose an Estate Late.

Danny’s books for both companies are not done for these years.  We got someone who will move onto these books once RegimA SA’s books are done. Do you not have estimates of annual turnover, I am concerned that the CIPC will deregister the company.

Regards

Good morning Clare

Danny’s books for both companies are not done for these years.  We got someone who will move onto these books once RegimA SA’s books are done.

I do not have anything on Jozi Way, so I will contact the attorney who did all Danny’s companies paperwork before, to get it from them.

I have attached so long for you the CIPC docs, share certificates etc. for Unicorn.

Regards
