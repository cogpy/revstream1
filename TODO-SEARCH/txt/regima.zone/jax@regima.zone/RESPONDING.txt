Hi  We have tried to follow your guidance:
We trimmed the text down dramatically, as requested
We did the line by line narrative.  Note from the second page the text goes from 7., then 8. 9. On subsequent pages
We made the narrative so that it could be read quickly and understood easily, ensuring all important timelines were included and all important points included.
PLEASE LET US KNOW IF THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR?
