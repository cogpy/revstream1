PART II: THE NETWORK OF CONTROL
The Power Structure
Bantjies: The Hidden Hand
• Undisclosed trustee of Faucitt Family Trust
• Debtor owing R18.685M to the trust
• Accountant for all RegimA companies
• Controller of financial systems
• Commissioner of Oaths who certified Peter's affidavit
• Dismissed Daniel's audit request on June 10, 2025
• Allegedly instructed Rynette to make substantial payments (per SARS audit email)
Rynette Farrar: The Administrator
• Controlled accounting system using Peter's email (pete@regima.com)
• Controlled all bank accounts
• Made false statement to Jacqui that R1,035,000 debt was paid
• Sister Linda employed as bookkeeper (yet expenses unallocated for 2 years)
• Claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions, not Peter's
• Impersonated Peter using his email address
Adderory (Rynette's Son): The Beneficiary
• Registered competing domain regimaskin.co.za on May 29, 2025
• Supplied stock to RegimA Skin Treatments
• Same stock type as R5.4M that "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics
• Received customer diversions via email instructions (June 20, 2025)
Peter: The Figurehead
• No access to email (controlled by Rynette)
• No access to bank accounts (controlled by Rynette)
• No access to accounting systems (controlled by Rynette)
• Does not use a computer
• Does not do any banking
• Made unauthorized R900K transfers without Daniel's authority
• Cancelled 15 cards secretly without informing Jacqui or Daniel
PART III: JAX'S COMMENTARY INTEGRATION
Section 4: Urgency and Delay (AD 7-7.20)
Jax's Core Arguments:
1. No Urgency for Applicant
• Peter claimed urgency only in July when Jacqui and Daniel were trying to resolve
SARS audit
• Complete mischaracterization to claim urgency and manipulate timeline proximity
• 67-day delay between Daniel's reports (June 6) and interdict (August 13) contradicts
urgency
2. Actual Urgency for Respondents
• Financial impact due to Peter's actions
• Rynette (bookkeeper) doing all banking transactions daily
• Jacqui and Daniel unable to see any accounts
• Massive impact on RegimA Skin Treatments from incompetent bookkeeper
3. Jacqui's Essential Role
• CEO who launched RegimA Skin Treatments 33 years ago
• Built company into one of SA's most successful skin treatment companies
• Won all major industry awards
• Every word ever written about RegimA written by Jacqui
• Treated thousands of patients referred from leading plastic surgeons
• Only person at RegimA office who can treat patients
• Essential for UK and European business as Responsible Person
4. Price Increase Sabotage
• Annual price increase usually done by Daniel (mathematician)
• Bookkeeper did it instead and caused "dreadful harm" to the structure
• Demonstrates incompetence and operational damage
5. Card Cancellations
• All card cancellations carried out by Peter alone in secret
• Nobody informed Jacqui or Daniel
• Peter cancelled all worldwide FNB cards, specifically Jacqui and Dan's cards
• Payments defaulted because of secret cancellations
6. Rynette's Interference
• Took RegimA logo and IP information and put it in her son's name
• Sent emails instructing RegimA database not to use regima.zone email addresses
• Used new addresses she put in place (regimaskin.co.za)
• Did this without informing Jacqui or Daniel
• Cancelled regima.zone email addresses
• Impersonated Peter using pete@regima.com
7. System Cancellations
• Peter instructed Rynette to cancel all Shopify and other systems
• These systems had been set up to automate sales
• Were working very well (same system UK successfully uses)
• Deliberate sabotage of profitable operations
Section 5: Financial Discrepancies (AD 8.4-9.3)
Jax's Core Arguments:
1. Bantjies's Conflict of Interest (AD 8.4)
• Accountant who "discovered" discrepancies is also:
• Undisclosed trustee
• Debtor owing R18.685M
• Controller of financial systems
• Recipient of Daniel's fraud report (June 6, 2025)
• Dismissed Daniel's audit request on June 10, 2025
• "Discovery" occurred after Daniel exposed fraud to the person facilitating it
2. Two Years of Unallocated Expenses (AD 8.5)
• Occurred while Rynette controlled accounting system using Peter's email
• Linda (Rynette's sister) employed as bookkeeper
• Bantjies was the accountant
• Question: Why were expenses unallocated for 2 years if accountant and bookkeeper
were performing duties?
• Dumped into RegimA Worldwide on March 30, 2025
3. IT Expenses Context (AD 8.7)
• Peter claims R6.7M (2024) and R2.1M (2025) are "almost entirely unexplainable"
• Context omitted: These expenses supported 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9M
annually
• IT expenses represent 19.3% of revenue (2024) and 6.1% of revenue (2025)
• Reasonable for global e-commerce operation
• Peter deliberately fails to disclose revenue context
4. International Payment Flow (AD 8.10, 9.2)
• Peter claims expenses are "seemingly international" and accounts "almost
exceeded yearly allowable quota"
• Shopify platforms funded by UK company RegimA Zone Ltd (company 10697009)
• UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments
• International expenses were legitimate costs of UK-owned e-commerce operations
• Actual payment flow: UK → SA (R84,661+ annually)
• Peter's affidavit implies opposite direction (SA → UK)
• Demonstrable misrepresentation
5. Actual Financial Misconduct (AD 9.3)
• R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA (Feb 14-15, 2025) without
Daniel's authority
• R5.4 million stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics
• Same stock type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments
• Rynette claimed Bantjies instructed substantial payments (SARS audit email)
• R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023
• Unpaid despite Rynette's false claim to Jacqui that it was paid
• Kayla murdered July 13, 2023
• "Profiting from proceeds of murder"
Section 6: Delinquency Application (AD 10.1-10.14)
Jax's Core Arguments:
1. Grounds for Peter's Delinquency (AD 10.1)
• Unauthorized R900K transfers in breach of fiduciary duty as co-director
• Card cancellation sabotage one day after Daniel's cooperation
• False statements about UK payment flows
• Abuse of ex parte process through material non-disclosures
2. Jacqui's Actual Conduct (AD 10.3)
• Fulfilled fiduciary duty as trustee by investigating R1,035,000 debt (May 15, 2025)
• Confronted Rynette about profiting from proceeds of murder
• Deceived by co-trustees into signing "Main Trustee" document (Aug 11, 2025)
• Punished with interdict two days later (Aug 13, 2025)
3. Peter's Bad Faith (AD 10.4)
• Manufactured crisis (card cancellation day after cooperation)
• Material non-disclosures in ex parte application
• False statements about UK operations
• Systematic sabotage of profitable businesses
4. Bantjies's Triple Conflict (AD 10.5.2)
• Trustee + Debtor + Accountant
• Commissioned Peter's affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths
• Had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery of fraud Daniel reported
5. Close Corporations Act Violations (AD 10.6-10.7)
• RegimA Skin Treatments owes R1,035,000 to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023
• Strategic Logistics lost R5.4M in stock that "disappeared"
• Same stock type supplied by Adderory
• Transactions not in corporations' interests
6. Multiple Conflicts of Interest (AD 10.6.3)
• Bantjies: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant
• Rynette's son (Adderory) supplying stock while same type "disappeared" from
Strategic Logistics
• Villa Via (trust-owned) charging 86% profit margin rent to group
• Regimaskin.co.za (owned by Rynette's son) competing with RegimA operations
7. Economic Benefits Derived (AD 10.7.1.2)
• R900,000 unauthorized transfers
• R5.4M stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics
• R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate
• 86% profit margin on Villa Via rent
• Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za (Adderory)
8. Systematic Fraud Pattern (AD 10.8-10.9)
• R5.4M stock adjustment (46% of sales, 10x historical)
• Rynette claimed Bantjies instructed payments
• Same stock type supplied by Adderory
• Suggests systematic fraud and transfer pricing manipulation
Section 7: UK Operations (AD 11.2-12.4)
Jax's Core Arguments:
1. UK Ownership and Funding (AD 11.2, 11.8)
• UK companies owned by Daniel Faucitt
• Monies from UK transactions owed to Daniel
• Daniel personally funded Shopify stores with his own funds
• Proven by bank records and Shopify invoices
2. Peter's Non-Role (AD 11.3, 11.4)
• Peter has no role whatsoever in UK entity
• Only Jacqui and Daniel are essential for UK entity
• Peter does not own any UK entities
• Daniel paid for all UK business with personal cards
3. Payment Direction Truth (AD 12.1, 12.2)
• Peter does not own any UK entities
• Daniel has paid for all UK business with personal cards
• Daniel pays for Shopify with personal cards
• Opposite of Peter's claims
Section 8: Interdictory Relief (AD 13.2-13.8)
Jax's Core Arguments:
1. No Prejudice to Peter (AD 13.2)
• Peter is not prejudiced whatsoever
• Manufactured the crisis himself
2. Actual Injury to Respondents (AD 13.2.2)
• Jacqui and Daniel being injured since interdict enforced
• RegimA businesses injured on daily basis by interdict
• Ongoing operational damage
3. Irreparable Harm to Companies (AD 13.3)
• Irreparable harm being done to RegimA companies every day interdict is in place
• Restriction of daily access to companies
• Operational paralysis
4. Jacqui's Essential Role (AD 13.4, 13.5)
• Interdicts stop Jacqui being Responsible Person for UK and European business
• Essential role necessary for overseas sales
• Only legal when Responsible Person is in office to oversee all sales
• Jacqui and Daniel essential for RegimA business
PART IV: THE EVIDENCE WEB
Timeline of Retaliation
Jacqui's Timeline:

• Rynette: Email (pete@regima.com) + Bank accounts + Accounting system + Daily
transactions
• Linda (Rynette's sister): Bookkeeper (yet expenses unallocated for 2 years)
• Adderory (Rynette's son): Competing domain + Stock supplier + Customer diversion
beneficiary
• Peter: No email access + No bank access + No accounting access + No computer use
Who Instructs Whom:
• Rynette claims to act under Bantjies's instructions (not Peter's)
• Bantjies allegedly instructed substantial payments (per SARS audit email)
• Peter appears to be figurehead, not actual controller
PART V: THE NARRATIVE STRATEGY
Gradual Revelation Technique
The narrative should reveal connections gradually, allowing the reader to discover the truth:
Layer 1: Surface Claims
• Peter claims urgency
• Peter claims financial mismanagement
• Peter claims need for protection
Layer 2: Timeline Contradictions
• 67-day delay contradicts urgency
• Card cancellation day after cooperation
• Interdict 2 days after document signing
Layer 3: Control Structure
• Rynette controls everything using Peter's email
• Peter has no access to systems
• Rynette claims to act under Bantjies's instructions
Layer 4: Financial Connections
• Bantjies is undisclosed trustee and R18.685M debtor
• Adderory (Rynette's son) benefits from domain and stock
• R5.4M stock "disappeared" - same type Adderory supplies
Layer 5: The Pattern Emerges
• Jacqui investigates debt → immediate retaliation
• Daniel exposes fraud → immediate sabotage
• Both punished for fulfilling duties
• Systematic destruction of R34.9M operations
Layer 6: The Truth Revealed
• Not mismanagement, but systematic fraud
• Not urgency, but manufactured crisis
• Not protection, but punishment
• Not Peter in control, but Bantjies and Rynette

PART VII: COHERENT STORY FRAMEWORK
The Complete Narrative Arc
Chapter 1: Success Built Jacqui built RegimA Skin Treatments over 33 years into one of
South Africa's most successful skin treatment companies, winning all major industry
awards. Daniel and Kayla built 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9M annually, funded by
UK company RegimA Zone Ltd. The operations were profitable and growing.
Chapter 2: The Hidden Structure Behind the scenes, a control structure operated:
• Bantjies held triple role: Trustee + Accountant + Debtor (R18.685M)
• Rynette controlled all systems using Peter's email
• Linda (Rynette's sister) employed as bookkeeper
• Adderory (Rynette's son) supplied stock and later registered competing domain
• Peter had no access to email, banks, or accounting systems
Chapter 3: The Confrontation On May 15, 2025, Jacqui confronted Rynette about
R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023. Jacqui stated this was "profiting from
proceeds of murder" (Kayla murdered July 13, 2023). Rynette had falsely claimed the debt
was paid.
Chapter 4: Immediate Retaliation (Jacqui)
• May 22, 2025 (7 days): Shopify audit trail becomes unavailable
• May 29, 2025 (14 days): Domain regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory
• June 20, 2025: Email instructions sent to use new domain instead of regima.zone
Chapter 5: The Fraud Exposure On March 30, 2025, two years of unallocated expenses
were dumped into RegimA Worldwide with a 12-hour deadline. Daniel used this time (until
June 6) to analyze and expose fraud, including Villa Via's 86% profit margin rent extraction.
He reported findings to Bantjies, unknowingly reporting to the person facilitating the fraud.
Chapter 6: Immediate Retaliation (Daniel)
• June 7, 2025 (1 day): 15 company cards cancelled secretly
• June 10, 2025 (4 days): Bantjies dismisses audit request
• July 8, 2025: Warehouse operations stopped, destroying R34.9M business
• September 11, 2025: Accounts emptied (Daniel was still managing to pay creditors)
Chapter 7: The Ex Parte Deception Peter's founding affidavit contained material nondisclosures
and false statements:
• Omitted Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status
• Omitted Bantjies's R18.685M debt
• Omitted R34.9M revenue context for IT expenses
• Falsely implied SA → UK payment flow (actually UK → SA)
• Manipulated timeline to create false urgency (67-day delay)
• Omitted Jacqui's debt inquiry and subsequent retaliation
• Omitted Daniel's fraud exposure and subsequent sabotage
Chapter 8: The Punishment
• August 11, 2025: Jacqui deceived into signing "Main Trustee" document
• August 13, 2025: Interdict granted against Jacqui and Daniel (2 days later)
• Both excluded from profitable businesses they built
• Both punished by co-trustees for fulfilling duties
Chapter 9: The Truth Emerges The evidence reveals:
• Not mismanagement, but systematic fraud
• Not urgency, but manufactured crisis (card cancellation created the problem)
• Not protection, but punishment (for investigating and exposing fraud)
• Not Peter in control, but Bantjies and Rynette (Peter had no access to systems)
• Not SA funding UK, but UK funding SA (R84,661+ annually)
• Not unexplainable expenses, but reasonable costs for R34.9M operations
Chapter 10: The Pattern Two beneficiaries fulfilled their duties:
• Jacqui as trustee investigated R1,035,000 debt
• Daniel as director exposed systematic fraud
Both were immediately retaliated against:
• Jacqui: Data expungement (7 days), domain theft (14 days), interdict (3 months)
• Daniel: Card cancellation (1 day), audit dismissal (4 days), warehouse sabotage, account
emptying
The co-trustees (Peter and Bantjies) used trust, companies, banks, and courts to attack the
beneficiaries who exposed the fraud.

profit extraction
3. The Retaliation Pattern: Immediate punishment for investigating/exposing fraud
4. The Ex Parte Deception: Material non-disclosures and false statements
5. The Manufactured Crisis: Peter created the problems he complains about
6. The Truth: UK funded SA (not vice versa), IT expenses reasonable for R34.9M operations
