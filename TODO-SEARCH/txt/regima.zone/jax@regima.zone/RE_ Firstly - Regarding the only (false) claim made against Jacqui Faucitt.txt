Hi Natan

Yes essentially this particular claim would be the Company documents, Danny’s transaction history and the statement by Pete in the interdict itself confirming the card cancellation.

The more detailed timeline involving the primary issue leading up to the interdict will follow shortly. The events between March and June (prior to the stated initiating cause of the interdict) demonstrate strong evidence of how our revenue streams were hijacked. These involve the payment diversion, audit trail disappearance, fulfilment blockade and communication interception in an almost mechanically precise series of weekly actions that ultimately resulted in payments and customer queries going elsewhere while we were left with the expenses and our ability to pay such expenses was systematically removed through card cancellations, interdicts and finally the emptying of the accounts forcing them into insolvency. There are several key pieces of evidence we are still recovering but 80% of the material supporting evidence is in place.

Warm Regards
Dan & Jax

# Corrected Evidence Analysis - Case 2025_137857
*Date: September 30, 2025*

## Critical Corrections to Case Narrative

### 1. Jacqui Faucitt's Role

**ESTABLISHED FACTS**:
- Jacqui Faucitt does NOT handle finances and was informed by Daniel of the payment failures
- She has NO involvement in financial operations regarding RWW creditors
- She did NOT give R500,000 to Daniel (this is a misrepresentation)

**EVIDENCE**: 
- No documentation shows Jacqui performing any unusual financial transactions
- Daniel Faucitt transferred funds to pay creditors when FNB cards cancelled without his knowledge defaulted for 6 weeks from 7 June
- The R500,000 was a director's loan, not a gift

**CONCLUSION**: Jacqui Faucitt has done nothing wrong financially

### 2. The R500,000 Director's Loan - Actual Facts

**DOCUMENTED REALITY**:
- **Who**: Daniel Faucitt (company founder and owner)
- **What**: Director's loan from his own company
- **Amount**: R500,000
- **Date**: July 16, 2025
- **Why**: To maintain company operations after FNB cards were secretly cancelled

**CORRECTING THE FALSE NARRATIVE**:
- This was NOT a "gift" from Jacqui
- This was NOT unauthorized - Daniel owns the company
- This was a LEGITIMATE director's loan
- Directors have the legal right to take loans from their companies

**EVIDENCE**:
- Timeline shows: "Dan draws R500,000 Director Loan from SLG"
- Context: "Due to FNB card cancellations 6 weeks earlier"
- Purpose: "maintain creditor payments"

### 3. The Card Cancellation Context

**TIMELINE OF EVENTS**:
1. **June 7, 2025**: FNB Company cards secretly cancelled
2. **June 7 - July 16**: Daniel pays nearly ALL company creditors from personal account
3. **July 16, 2025**: Director's loan taken to:
   - Reimburse Daniel's personal expenditures
   - Continue paying company obligations
   - Maintain business operations

**BUSINESS NECESSITY**: Without this loan, the company would have defaulted on obligations

### 4. Account Control - Who Can Actually Do What

**RYNETTE FARRAR**:
- Has exclusive access to all accounts (documented)
- Only person who can move money
- Controls Pete@regima.com <mailto:Pete@regima.com>  email address

**JACQUI FAUCITT**:
- Does NOT do finance with ABSA
- Has NO account access to ABSA
- Cannot transfer funds from ABSA

**PETER FAUCITT**:
- Has NO direct account access
- Cannot steal money he can't access
- All his emails go through Rynette

**DANIEL FAUCITT**:
- Company founder and owner
- Took legitimate director's loan
- Was protecting company by paying creditors personally

### 5. Debunking False Accusations

**FALSE CLAIM**: "Jacqui gave R500,000 to Daniel"
**TRUTH**: Daniel took a director's loan from his own company

**FALSE CLAIM**: "The R500,000 was unauthorized"
**TRUTH**: Directors can legally take loans from their companies

**FALSE CLAIM**: "The R500,000 was a birthday gift"
**TRUTH**: It was a documented director's loan for business operations

### 6. Legal and Financial Reality

**Director's Loans**:
- Legal and common business practice
- Require proper documentation (which exists)
- Often used for cash flow management
- Especially necessary in emergency situations

**The Emergency**:
- FNB Cards cancelled secretly (June 7)
- Business operations at risk
- Creditors needed payment
- Director stepped in with personal funds

### 7. Summary of Who Did What

**DANIEL FAUCITT**:
✓ Took legitimate director's loan
✓ Saved company from defaulting
✓ Used personal funds for 6 weeks
✓ Acted as responsible company owner

**JACQUI FAUCITT**:
✓ Not involved in finances
✓ Did not give anyone money
✓ Has no financial wrongdoing

**RYNETTE FARRAR**:
✓ Controls all ABSA accounts
✓ Only person who can move money
✓ Has exclusive system access

**PETER FAUCITT**:
✓ Has no account access
✓ Cannot have stolen funds
✓ Depends on Rynette for information

## Conclusion

The narrative that Jacqui gave Daniel R500,000 is completely false. The facts show:

1. Daniel took a legitimate director's loan from his own company
2. This was necessary due to secret card cancellations on FNB
3. Jacqui doesn't do finance and wasn't involved
4. Only Rynette Farrar has the ability to move money in ABSA
5. Peter couldn't have stolen anything without account access

All accusations against Jacqui regarding this R500,000 are baseless and contradicted by documented evidence.
