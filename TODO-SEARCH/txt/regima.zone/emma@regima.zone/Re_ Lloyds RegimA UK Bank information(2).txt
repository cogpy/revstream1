Hey,
Oh no, I think they are now sim only due to being out of contract. Is this ok? What do you need on them data wise/calls/texts and I will call shortly to check. Or is WiFi enough?

Hey Em 🙂
After struggling like a fool trying to get the signal on the phone working and clear space for messages..
I finally figured out that my numbers have been disconnected recently and it says sort account with EE to relink them..
The PayPal, Lloyds and other apps are OTP to those numbers so that may be why its causing issues..
Plz can you get EE to relink my 2 numbers then I can login again and we can sort everything 😄

Warm Regards,
Dan

Hello,
I hope yesterday went well. 
We received the attached letter. From Lloyds that needs to be returned to them by 15th December If they don't receive it then our bank can no longer stay active.
Warm regards
