Ohh yes, if it only charges on days you use then that makes sense. Otherwise it sounded super expensive haha. I will confirm that's the case and get it added. One number is on the Dr H account and one is on the Zone so Ill add it to both.

Warm regards

Oh cool lets make sure Dr H always stays above £ 2,000 balance to prevent any bouncing..
£5.30 sounds familiar it used to send me a text when I used it that it was charging £5.30 but just check if there is a way they can set it up so it only charges when it gets used. I will probably use it 1 day each week (roughly 4 days each month) so I just need it on those days

Ok it looks like the phones weren't working because Dr H had been cut off due to the payments bouncing. They said restart your phones and maybe allow up to 24 hours.
With regards to the roaming. They said they said all they can offer is £5.30 a day or £25 for 7 days. Not sure what has changed!
Warm regards
