100% need backup options, some people aren't paying because they don't want to pay via bank at the moment.

Warm regards

PayPal said they are having issues and struggling to solve it so that's why they aren't working. I do think it would be so much better to have sumpup alongside side them though as their rates are much cheaper

Hey Em 🙂
After struggling like a fool trying to get the signal on the phone working and clear space for messages..
I finally figured out that my numbers have been disconnected recently and it says sort account with EE to relink them..
The PayPal, Lloyds and other apps are OTP to those numbers so that may be why its causing issues..
Plz can you get EE to relink my 2 numbers then I can login again and we can sort everything 😄

Warm Regards,
Dan

Hello,
I hope yesterday went well. 
We received the attached letter. From Lloyds that needs to be returned to them by 15th December If they don't receive it then our bank can no longer stay active.
Warm regards
