Dear Jacqui, Danny and Peter

Regarding the uncertainties surrounding the computer expenses as well as the financial status of the Regima Group of Companies, I would like to suggest the following:

1.      I prefer not to meet with individual parties regarding this matter to maintain my impartiality. Instead, I will present a factual report on:
o   Consolidated External Revenues for the past two years
o   Consolidated Net Trading Profits or Losses for the past two financial years for the entire group
o   Computer expenses over the past two financial years
o   The consolidated bank balances across the Group.

2. Computer Expenses – details:

Attached is a schedule of all computer expenses allocated by Rynette for March and April 2025.

Danny to kindly provide the following next to each expense:
*	Description of the expense (licenses, usage costs, etc.) in layman’s terms.
*	Current or future business application.
*	Justification from SARS’ perspective as “ in the production of income.” This serves a dual purpose, as I'm expecting SARS to audit our computer expenses claimed for tax, so this gets us ready for such an audit.

I trust this will be in order.

Kind regards,

Danie Bantjes
