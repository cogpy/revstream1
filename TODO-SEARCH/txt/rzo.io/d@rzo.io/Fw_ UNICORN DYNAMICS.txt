We need to advise the CIPC of the passing of Kayla and remove her as a director.  In order that I may prepare the necessary documents, I require the following:

Subject: Unicorn & Joziway

Good morning Clare

Danny’s books for both companies are not done for these years.  We got someone who will move onto these books once RegimA SA’s books are done.

I do not have anything on Jozi Way, so I will contact the attorney who did all Danny’s companies paperwork before, to get it from them.

I have attached so long for you the CIPC docs, share certificates etc. for Unicorn.

Regards
