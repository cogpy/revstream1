Hi Dave 

Just discussed with Pete and he says we are not in a rush with Clark, the most important thing is to make them spend more money and have that pressure over their heads.  Would they need to get an advocate to go to court for the condonation?  The more pressure on Clark the better, and if her attorney has screwed up a bit on her behalf then more the better.  We can wait it out, she may struggle to do that.

The plea is nonsense, what are your thoughts and angles?

Pete has said that the Kachan one is the one we want to nail asap.

Cheers Dave

Jax & Pete

Hello Pete and Jax

Herewith as received this morning.

The plea is one day late after the service of our notice of bar.

I await your instructions but my advice is that we should allow the matter to proceed and deal with the merits.

If I take the point that they are one day late Warrener will have to bring an application to condone his late filing (which I believe will be successful in these times where almost anything is condoned). The only thing that will happen  that we will delay the process which we do not wish to do as we want our day in court (oe money asap).

Anyway I wait to hear from you.

Dave
