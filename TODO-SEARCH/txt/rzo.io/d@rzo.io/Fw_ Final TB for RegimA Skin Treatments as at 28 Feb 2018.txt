	Hi Danie

	Further to my email below, please see Recons attached for the other RegimA Skin Treatments’ Supplier Account. The Supplier is Rezonance (Pty) Ltd – SA

	Please forward the journals that you need me to process to bring the March 2017 to Feb 2018 figures into the Books. (please note that the debit balance on account: 5461/000 that was adjusted with your yearend journal needs to be allocated to the Rezonance account)

	Once these 2 Suppliers viz: RegimA Zone Academy & Rezonance have been adjusted then all should be good to go.

	Please give me a call if you have any queries.

	Please advise & confirm if  the financials for RegimA Worldwide been done and whether there are any Journals that need to be processed?

	Hi Danie

	As discussed, please see Recons attached for a RegimA Skin Treatments’ Supplier account. The Supplier name is RegimA Zone Academy Ltd

	Please forward journals that you need me to process to bring the March 2017 to Feb 2018 figures into the Books.

	Please confirm that I only need to process the March 2018 to Sept 2018 Invoices into the Current years’ books?

	There are more journals that will need to be processed for another Supplier called Rezonance – I will forward to you hopefully by Monday once finalized.

	Have the financials for RegimA Worldwide been done and are there any Journals that need to be processed?

	Kind Regards
