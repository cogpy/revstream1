Dear UNICORN DYNAMICS PTY LTD, 
Re: Required tax information for UNICORN DYNAMICS PTY LTD (UCN: 50914204) 
Please complete the following self-certification form as: 
*	Your Tax Information is outstanding; please reconfirm
At FNB, we aim to make banking with us hassle-free. 
That's why we support you by ensuring that you comply with the relevant legislative requirements. 
The South African Revenue Service (SARS) requires us to comply with the Common Reporting Standards (CRS) and Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) under the Tax Administration Act. A media briefing was held by SARS on 27 February 2017 in which SARS advised taxpayers that they may be contacted by their financial institutions to declare any tax obligations, payments of taxes, or tax residence(s) in South Africa or in another jurisdiction. It is a requirement of the Tax Administration Act, 2011, to provide this information to your financial institution. 
	 What you need to do: 
Please complete the attached self-certification form as well as other forms if required. Reply to this email without changing the subject line. 
	 Note: Please always scroll to the bottom of the form to ensure it is complete. Please ensure you have the latest version of Adobe Reader installed on your computer. 
Your account is at risk of being frozen. If you do not return the completed form, we are obligated to report your non-compliance to SARS who, in turn, are obligated by law to notify the foreign 
tax authority. 

Should you have any queries about the process or your status as a reportable person, 
please call 087 730  6020 or email JuristicCRS@ fnb. co.za 
Operating hours: 
Monday to Friday: 08h00 - 17h00 
Saturdays: 08h00 - 13h00 
Closed on Sundays and public holidays 
For information about the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), visit www. irs .gov
and for information about CRS, visit www .oecd .org
