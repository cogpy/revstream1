Hi Marisca

No, I think the best will be to create a loan account within RegimA SA, for the other company.   Then these invoice (not belonging to RegimA SA) can be allocated to this loan account.

Regards

Hi Rynette,

Die betalings in Regima vir Quickbooks en vir Corel (sien onder), is dit een van die ander companies se expense of moet ons dit wys as expense vir RegimA?
