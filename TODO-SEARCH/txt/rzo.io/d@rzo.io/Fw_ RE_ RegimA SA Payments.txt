Hi Marisca

The distributor in the Cape is known as Dermal Skin.

The expenses for the Coral draw and Quickbooks do not belong to this company, so I suggest you open a loan account for one of Danny’s other company’s called Rezonance and post these expenses then to Rezonance’s loan account.

Regards

On a previous occasion you said that is the entity who the receipts that Regima receives belong to, so we have a loan account called Dermal Skincare where we allocate all the income to.
If the name is not correct, we can change that.
Do the expenses for Coral and Quickbooks belong to this same entity of to which loan account do you want us to allocate is to?
Kind Regards

Hi Marisca

No, I think the best will be to create a loan account within RegimA SA, for the other company.   Then these invoice (not belonging to RegimA SA) can be allocated to this loan account.

Hi Rynette,

Die betalings in Regima vir Quickbooks en vir Corel (sien onder), is dit een van die ander companies se expense of moet ons dit wys as expense vir RegimA?
