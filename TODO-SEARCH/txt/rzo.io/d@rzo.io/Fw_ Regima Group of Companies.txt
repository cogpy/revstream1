	Dear Jacqui, Danny and Peter

	Regarding the uncertainties surrounding the computer expenses as well as the financial status of the Regima Group of Companies, I would like to suggest the following:

	1.      I prefer not to meet with individual parties regarding this matter to maintain my impartiality. Instead, I will present a factual report on:
	o   Consolidated External Revenues for the past two years
	o   Consolidated Net Trading Profits or Losses for the past two financial years for the entire group
	o   Computer expenses over the past two financial years
	o   The consolidated bank balances across the Group.

	2. Computer Expenses – details:

	Attached is a schedule of all computer expenses allocated by Rynette for March and April 2025.

	Danny to kindly provide the following next to each expense:

	*	Description of the expense (licenses, usage costs, etc.) in layman’s terms.
	*	Current or future business application.
	*	Justification from SARS’ perspective as “ in the production of income.” This serves a dual purpose, as I'm expecting SARS to audit our computer expenses claimed for tax, so this gets us ready for such an audit.

	I trust this will be in order.

	Kind regards, 
	Danie Bantjes
