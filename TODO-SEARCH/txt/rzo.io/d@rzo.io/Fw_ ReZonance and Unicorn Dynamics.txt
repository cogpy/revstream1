Hi Kayla 
No worries. The first few days of a month are normally pretty hectic, can we aim for Friday, 4th February?

Kind regards, 
Danie Bantjes

	Morning Kayla
	No worries at all.
	I'm planning on a 2-week break around 15th January.
	Early February would be ideal. Whenever it suits you then.

	Kind regards,

		Hi Danie 

		I hope you are well and having a great vacation! 

		I'm sorry to worry you during the holidays, I just wanted to find out if we could schedule a meeting with Dan and myself in Jan or early Feb to sort out Unicorn Dynamics and ReZonance accounts, if you could please let me know what you need in the mean time so I can prep for when we meet in the new year. 

		Have a wonderful Christmas!  🎄 :)
