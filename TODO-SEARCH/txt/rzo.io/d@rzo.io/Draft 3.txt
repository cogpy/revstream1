# PART III: SECTION B
## REFUTATION OF ALL ALLEGATIONS AGAINST DANIEL FAUCITT

### 19.
Each allegation will be systematically refuted with documentary evidence.

### 20.3 THE IRONY
The Applicant alleges unauthorized access by Daniel while:
- Rynette (non-director) has sole control

## REFUTATION OF ERRATIC BEHAVIOR ALLEGATIONS
### 23. Allegation: "Daniel's behavior has become increasingly erratic"
### 23.1 THE CONTEXT IGNORED
What the Applicant calls "erratic" was actually:
- Reporting murder and fraud (August 2023)
- Discovering financial crimes
- Protecting company assets
- Whistleblowing on corruption
### 23.2 THE GASLIGHTING
Classic abuse tactic:
- Commit crimes
- Attack the victim who reports them
- Call victim "erratic" for speaking truth
- Use courts to silence victim
### 23.3 THE EVIDENCE OF STABILITY
**ANNEXURE DF-11**: Business Performance Under Daniel
- Revenue growth 2023-2025: +47%
- Customer satisfaction scores: 94%

Hardly the work of someone "erratic"

### 24.3 THE ALTERNATIVE
Had Daniel not acted:

### 25.3 THE PROJECTION
- Applicant disrupted operations
- Applicant caused staff anxiety

- Then blamed Daniel for fixing it
## REFUTATION OF CORPORATE ABUSE ALLEGATIONS
### 26. Allegation: "Daniel abused corporate position"

**ANNEXURE DF-14**: Corporate Protection Measures
- Prevented R12.3 million theft (attempted)

### 26.2 THE FIDUCIARY DUTY
As director, Daniel was REQUIRED to:

He did exactly that.
## THE WHISTLEBLOWER PERSECUTION
### 27.
The truth is that Daniel is being persecuted for exposing:
### 27.1 The Murder Connection
**ANNEXURE DF-15**: Email to ENS dated 29 August 2025
"As you are aware, Kayla was murdered and Peter committed crimes thereafter"
### 27.2 The Financial Fraud

- Rynette's unauthorized control
- Customer theft scheme
### 27.3 The Cover-Up

- Threats and intimidation
- Abuse of court process
### 27.4 The Retaliation
This interdict is pure retaliation for:

- Refusing to stay silent
- Seeking justice
## COMPARATIVE CREDIBILITY ANALYSIS
### 28.
**Daniel's Evidence**: Documents, bank statements, emails, system logs
**Applicant's Evidence**: Unsubstantiated allegations, hearsay, assumptions
### 29.
**Daniel's Transparency**: Provides all records, hides nothing
**Applicant's Concealment**: No personal accounts, no expense records, no explanation for R12.3m
### 30.
**Daniel's Consistency**: Same story throughout, supported by documents
**Applicant's Contradictions**: Claims emails he couldn't receive, ignores Rynette's control
## THE PREJUDICE TO DANIEL
