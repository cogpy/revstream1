If you do NOT have your spouse's information at hand or your Spouse does not have a South African ID number, we'll need to follow the normal 2-week Company Registration process and require additional documents.

We would suggest that you start by dividing only 100 shares between the current shareholders - then at a later stage you can offer more shares to existing or new investors. Please do not complete the shares as percentages.
