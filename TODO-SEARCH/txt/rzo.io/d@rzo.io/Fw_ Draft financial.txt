Subject: Draft financial 
Hi everyone 
After picking myself up from the floor hearing of Bernadine's resignation, I managed to meet our deadline for producing draft financials for all the companies.
These are draft financials for discussion purposes. We still need to do some footwork from a tax point of view.
I suggest we get together next Wednesday, 5th August at 14;00 to discuss, if that suits everyone?
Kind regards, 
Danie Bantjes
