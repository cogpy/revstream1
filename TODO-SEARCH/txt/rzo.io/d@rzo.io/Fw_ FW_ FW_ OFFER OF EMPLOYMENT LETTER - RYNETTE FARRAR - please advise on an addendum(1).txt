Morning Jacqui 
By referring to the BCEA for notice periods, I think that would suffice.

Kind regards, 
Danie Bantjes

	Hi Danie
	Many thanks.  As our staff start at 7.30 am, and as stated to Rynette at the interview, I have changed it on the offer from 8.00 to 7.30.  Should I put the notice periods into the contract, or are they just for our information?
	Cheers
	Jacqui

	Morning Pete
	Attached a modified letter dealing with the start date issue. I also changed the notice period clause; I know it cuts both ways but just in case she doesn't work out, under the BCEA the notice periods are as follows:

	  *   One week, if the employee has been employed for four weeks or less;
	  *   Two weeks, if the employee has been employed for more than four weeks but not more than one year;
	  *   Four weeks, if the employee has been employed for one year or more; or is a farm worker or domestic worker who has been employed for more than four weeks.
	Your call.
	Let me know if there's anything else.
	Kind regards,
	Danie Bantjes

	Hi Danie
	Please see attached, we have added Rynette's details.  We are just a little concerned about this Corona Virus and would like to add a paragraph to protect ourselves in the event that the virus causes disruption to the business and that we would have to possibly change the date of Rynette's starting employment.  We would obviously like to stick to the 14th April, but there would not be much point if staff have to work from home for a period of time.
	Please advise a suitable addendum to the employment offer.
	Cheers
	Pete
