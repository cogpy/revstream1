Good afternoon Michelle

I was supposed to discuss some of the below accounts with Daniel, however Friday’s meeting went on too long and I could not do it.

Pete said we can close Aymac and Corpclo, and I will forward you the letters when I’m done with my stock forecast.

Pete said he will go and discuss the last three accounts with Daniel, and then I will revert back.

Pete also wants to understand the following:  if there is no FS for the companies, you will make the accounts dormant.  How long do they stay dormant, and do you close them after a certain period of dormancy, or can one revive them again when the FS are out?

Regards
