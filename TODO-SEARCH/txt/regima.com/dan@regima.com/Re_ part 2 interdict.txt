Above 3.5.1 - Rynette did not cancel email addresses she issued new email addresses to all staff except Dan & Jax and an unsolicited direct marketing email was sent out instructing all customers not to use regima.zone emails anymore and to use regimaskin.co.za from now on. All done without our knowledge or consent
Above 16.2 - it wasn't money Kayla inherited it is money due from still outstanding invoices to RegimA Skin Treatments to Rezonance from 2023 (over a million in total). These funds need to be paid so that the accounts can be reconciled and half be paid over to Kayla's estate beneficiaries (her family).
16.2 - 500,000 not 5,000
17 - Not sure the trademark was signed over.. Consider rephrasing as signed over is specific to signed documents.. Rather state that POPIA violating communications were sent to all customers instructing them to use the domain owned by Rynette's son even though official RegimA entities have over 700 domains to choose from
