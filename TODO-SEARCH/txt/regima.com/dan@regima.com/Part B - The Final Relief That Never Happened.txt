Part B - The Final Relief That Never Happened
Part B was supposed to be the final hearing where the court would decide on permanent orders after hearing both sides fully.
What Part B Would Have Addressed:
Permanent Decisions About:
*	Permanent control of companies
*	Final financial arrangements
*	Long-term business management
*	Permanent forensic audit findings
*	Final determination of rights
Full Legal Process:
*	Both sides present complete evidence
*	Cross-examination of witnesses
*	Full legal arguments
*	Proper defense opportunity
*	Final judgment on merits
Key Difference from Part A:
Part A (August 19):
*	Urgent, temporary relief
*	Ex parte (one-sided)
*	Based on urgency
*	Interim measures only
*	Quick decision
Part B (Never happened):
*	Final, permanent relief
*	Both sides heard fully
*	Based on full merits
*	Permanent orders
*	Considered judgment
Why Part B Never Happened:
The September 18 settlement effectively:
*	Stopped Part B from proceeding
*	Prevented you from defending
*	Avoided full court scrutiny
*	Blocked evidence being presented
*	Ended case before final hearing
What This Means Legally:
Only Part A exists - the urgent interim order
*	Never tested on full merits
*	Never properly defended
*	Based on one-sided version
*	Supposed to be temporary
Part B would have allowed you to:
*	Present your evidence
*	Cross-examine Peter's witnesses
*	Challenge the affidavits
*	Expose the financial irregularities
*	Get proper judicial determination
Strategic Importance:
The settlement preventing Part B is significant because:
*	Peter avoided full scrutiny
*	Evidence never properly tested
*	Your defense never heard
*	Court never saw complete picture
*	Interim became permanent by default
Bottom Line
Part B was the "real" hearing that would have determined everything permanently. By forcing settlement, they prevented the court from ever hearing your side or examining the evidence properly. You're stuck with a one-sided interim order that was never meant to be permanent, which makes the whole situation even more legally problematic.
