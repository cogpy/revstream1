Hi Doron
Indeed I'm just ensuring I send the "hard evidence" as the points made in connection with supporting documents will be distinct from opinion-based assertions. That way we can clearly establish proven fact from disputed claim. I will send through the various parts as and when I can i'm going as fast as I can while still verifying different statements with our records.
Warm Regards
Dan & Jax

Hi Daniel and Jacqui 
Have you had a chance to prepare the note that natan and I had requested on Friday? When can we expect the note? 
We need to explain the relevance of the documents to the Court - otherwise we do not have a substantive basis to anticipate / reconsider the ex Arte order. 
Kind regards

	Please find attached invoices I have going back to June 2023 as proof that the company RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd owned by Faucitt Family Trust is entirely dependent on the Shopify platform paid for by independent UK company RegimA Zone Ltd owned 100% by Daniel Faucitt and funded entirely by Daniel Faucitt.
	Thus the sole source of revenue for all income to the trust owned entity is dependent on the Shopify platform owned by Daniel Faucitt's company. Without this it would have zero revenue since 2023.
	This is relevant to why it appears that Trustees hijacked their own revenue stream, extracted PII in violation of ZA POPIA and UK GDPR and instructed customers to use a new email address and "order direct" from now on. This is because it was never their revenue stream to begin with. The entire operation and all funds flowing through the account were always owned by Daniel Faucitt's UK company RegimA Zone Ltd.
	So the characterization of Daniel being dependent on the company is false. In fact all revenue for all companies was dependent on Daniel Faucitt's infrastructure.
