Dear Natan
Many thanks for this I will review it as soon as requisite morning nourishments and beverages are complete. I scanned the documents briefly and this represents a much more accurate depiction of the situation. We are now on the same page as to the broad outline of the various matters (which as you now see have been significantly distorted by the Applicant in key areas and many related to instances of material harm etc.). The perspectives are now sufficiently in accordance with the priority of events as well as the context in which they are to be understood. I have installed office on my other laptop so will go through the paragraphs as requested and add / update with relevant information.
One overarching note in case it helps: The problem arose originally due to the lockdown period where at the beginning (Mar 2020) our UK Shopify stores were conducting pilot tests in ZA with a handful of salons & doctors with sales just over R120k per month and by the end some 2 years later sales were around R1.8M per month. This was due to the flexibility of Shopify to add multiple fulfilment centres & supply sources through the e-commerce platform. Kayla and I were faced with the challenge that during the first 12 months of the lockdown, all the ZA companies had effectively gone bankrupt and the entire business was being run through the UK e-commerce platforms combined with 3rd party ZA fulfilment centre integrations. But all the clients were operating through GDPR & POPIA compliant gateways on the UK platform and we were still paying ZA staff salaries and usual daily activities were continuing as usual. We would need a mechanism for clients to voluntarily update their own accounts on a new ZA Shopify platform due to the POPIA requirements each one would need to consent etc.
It was Kayla who originally invoked "ubuntu" in this regard, proposing that since the ZA companies had helped UK out of the Isaac Chesno problem in 2015, we should find a way to attribute as much of the ZA revenue generated by the UK Shopify platform as possible to the ZA companies even though they were unable to generate it themselves and tell all the staff everything will be ok. Essentially Kayla proposed we give most of the money we made to the ZA companies to protect staff and ensure nobody was left behind. This was possible since Kayla and I as the registered merchants of all 51 stores decided the attribution of revenue in our personal capacities and in addition I am 100% shareholder of the organization RegimA Zone Ltd (UK) that owns the platform. To do this legitimately we had to process administrative invoices through Rezonance and Unicorn Dynamics where each month we would charge an admin fee and transfer the revenue stream to the various companies. This is why until the revenue stream hijacking in May 2025 we had Stock2Shop ZA multiplexing 27 store channels into 3 Sage Accounts systems for RegimA Worldwide, RegimA SA, RegimA Zone.. The purpose of this was to complete the transition from the UK owned RegimA Worldwide platform to 2 ZA owned RegimA SA & RegimA Zone platforms after which normal financial operations could resume.
The reason everything appears so overcomplicated and messy is the story of how Kayla and Dan discovered how difficult it actually is to "give away" R100M while satisfying every legal requirement of taxation and data protection required to do so legitimately. From minimum requirements of admin fees, correct invoicing procedures, both POPIA & GDPR, services vs products and revenue allocations vs import/export duties etc. And it was 90% complete in May 2025, all we need to do to complete the process is have the warehouse fulfil orders from the Shopify stores as they always have. Anyway just a brief explanation of the back story on how all this came to be. The total accumulated on the Shopify platform in question is actually around R208M at this point. RegimA SA had already begun steady sales based in a ZA company.. Also it is worth noting that Jax and Dan own personal computers as distinct from company owned computers for this reason also. All IP is owned by Jax & Dan in their personal capacity including all formulations for products manufactured by the companies. The reason we have not adopted the same "wild west" approach as the applicant is that one of our main concerns is disruption in continuity of business established over 30 years of customer trust in the industry - now in jeopardy due to the recent events.
Just some additional context. There are thousands of small businesses and tens of thousands of staff in the RegimA ecosystem that depend on our continued success. Thus while the Applicant seeks to sacrifice them all to satiate his own desires for self-serving enrichment, we must consider the wellbeing of the entire ecosystem and all affected parties over and above any harms done to us personally. Thus we are doing our best to fulfil our fiduciary duties and resume stable operations asap as a priority. This is chiefly why we want to avoid interpersonal complaints in our response as it diminishes the true broad-spectrum damage to many thousands of lives caused by the Applicant's actions. Will go through line by line responses ASAP. 
Warm Regards
Dan

Subject: UPDATED DRAFT 
Dear Daniel & Jacqui,
Please find attached the updated draft.
I’ve done my absolute best to make sense of the documents you provided and to incorporate them into your answering affidavit, which now forms the opening section of the draft. However, I’m still struggling to establish a clear chronology. 
As Doron and I have repeatedly requested from the outset, we urgently need a line-by-line response to the Applicant’s founding affidavit. We still have not received this from you. Please go through their affidavit paragraph by paragraph and indicate whether each statement is admitted or denied, with a brief explanation where necessary.
If you’re unable to do this in Microsoft Word, please send it by email instead – just list the paragraph numbers and your responses in order.
We will see you tomorrow at Doron's chambers at 11:00. 

Kind regards,
