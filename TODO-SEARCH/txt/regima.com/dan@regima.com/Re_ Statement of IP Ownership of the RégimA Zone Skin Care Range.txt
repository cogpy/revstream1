Dea John
Thank you so much this helps immeasurably. I see in the first 2 paragraphs the incorrect spelling Faucett is used if this could be corrected to Faucitt that would be perfect.
Indeed I wish I could say I was surprised but over my entire life the only thing my father has ever cared about is money and these days nothing surprises me in terms of the extent of human greed.
We will keep you updated as we navigate to get things back on track!
Warm Regards,
Dan

Dear Danny,

Lovely to chat to you again earlier today, I just wish it was under better circumstances.  Danny, please find a copy of the letter that I promised to prepare for you duly attached.  If you wish me to amend the content in any way, I would be delighted to make the necessary changes, and if you wish to share this with your legal advisors, please feel free to do so.

I must admit Danny that these revelations have shocked me to my core, I would never have believed that your dad could behave in this way.  I really hope that you and your mom can navigate a way forwards and that RégimA goes from strength to strength in the future.  If there is anything that I can do to assist you further, you only have to ask.

Much love to you and mom,

John
