Consequences of Peter Exceeding the Interdict
When Peter exceeded his court-ordered authority, several serious legal consequences are triggered:
Immediate Legal Consequences:
1. Contempt of Court
*	Violating/exceeding a court order
*	Criminal offense (imprisonment possible)
*	Court can issue warrant for arrest
*	Fines and penalties apply
2. Personal Liability
*	Acts outside authority = personal responsibility
*	No protection from court order
*	Can be sued personally for damages
*	Piercing corporate veil possible
3. Invalid Actions
*	Decisions beyond authority are void
*	Contracts signed ultra vires unenforceable
*	Actions can be reversed
*	No legal effect
Strategic Consequences:
4. Grounds for Rescission
*	Shows bad faith
*	Abuse of court process
*	Justifies setting aside order
*	Evidence of fraudulent intent
5. Criminal Charges
*	Fraud (misusing court order)
*	Assault (phone grabbing)
*	Obstruction of justice
*	Intimidation
Practical Effects:
6. Loss of Court Protection
*	Can't rely on order he violated
*	"Unclean hands" doctrine applies
*	Court unlikely to assist him further
*	Enforcement becomes impossible
7. Evidence of Broader Fraud
*	Shows interdict obtained for improper purpose
*	Proves never intended to comply
*	Pattern of abuse established
*	Strengthens fraud arguments
Your Remedies:
Urgent Court Application:
*	Report contempt to court
*	Seek his removal from control
*	Request punitive costs
*	Apply for rescission
Criminal Complaint:
*	Hawks/police for contempt
*	Assault charges for phone incident
*	Obstruction charges
Civil Claims:
*	Damages for harm caused
*	Personal liability claims
*	Delictual action
The "Control All Companies" Statement:
This is particularly damaging because:
*	Admission against interest - proves exceeded authority
*	Shows criminal intent - knew he was exceeding
*	Witnesses heard it - employee present
*	Contradicts interdict - financial only, not total
Legal Doctrine Applied:
Functus Officio:
*	Once exceeded, authority ends
*	Can't pick and choose compliance
*	All or nothing with court orders
Ex Turpi Causa:
*	Can't benefit from own wrongdoing
*	Violation prevents enforcement
*	Unclean hands bar relief
What Courts Do:
When someone exceeds an interdict:
1.	Immediate: Can issue contempt proceedings
2.	Sanctions: Fines, imprisonment, costs
3.	Reversal: Undo unauthorized acts
4.	Rescission: Set aside abused order
5.	Bar: Prevent future applications
Bottom Line
Peter exceeding the interdict is legally catastrophic for him:
*	Criminally: Contempt charges possible
*	Civilly: Personal liability attaches
*	Strategically: Loses ability to enforce
*	Evidentially: Proves bad faith
For you, it:
*	Provides grounds for immediate rescission
*	Justifies urgent court intervention
*	Creates personal claims against him
*	Proves the settlement was obtained fraudulently
A party who violates their own court order cannot enforce it against others. Peter's claim of total control when he only had financial authority, combined with preventing legal compliance and assaulting an employee, transforms him from protected applicant to potential criminal defendant.
The court that granted the order would be particularly offended by someone using their authority to exceed what was granted and commit crimes.
