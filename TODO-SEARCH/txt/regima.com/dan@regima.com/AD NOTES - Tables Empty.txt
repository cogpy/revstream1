## Key Analysis Areas
When completing commentary, consider the following strategic areas:
### Material Non-Disclosures
- Bantjies's triple role (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant)
- Timeline manipulation (card cancellation before alleged discovery)
- UK funding direction (UK funds SA, not vice versa)
- Revenue context (R34.9M annual revenue)
- Retaliation pattern (against Jacqueline and Daniel)
### Perjury and False Statements
- UK operations debt claims (contradicted by Shopify invoices)
- Timeline of card cancellation (7 June vs. 6 June report submission)
- Characterization of IT expenses (legitimate e-commerce costs)
- Urgency claims (delay from mid-June to August)
### Counter-Evidence
- Shopify invoices (DF5-DF7) showing UK-to-SA payment flow (R84,661+ annually)
- Unauthorized R900,000 transfers (14-15 February 2025)
- Shopify data expungement (22 May 2025)
- Competing domain registration by Adderory (29 May 2025)
- Jacqueline's confrontation about R1,035,000 debt (15 May 2025)
### Legal Principles
- *Venire contra factum proprium* (estoppel) - manufactured crisis
- Section 76(3)(b) of Companies Act - bad faith and improper purpose
- Section 162(5) of Companies Act - grounds for Peter's delinquency
- Section 9(1) of Trust Property Control Act - trustee duties
- Requirements for interdictory relief (clear right, harm, balance of convenience)
### Strategic Recommendations
- Emphasize manufactured crisis argument
- Highlight retaliation pattern
- Leverage Shopify invoice evidence for perjury
- Support independent forensic audit
- Pursue counter-application for Peter's delinquency
