1. Create a TXT record in your DNS configuration for the following hostname: _github-pages-challenge-regimazone.regimazone.org
2. Use this code for the value of the TXT record: 81afc7be72cfeec5c55b29c766414b
3. Wait until your DNS configuration changes. This could take up to 24 hours to propagate.
