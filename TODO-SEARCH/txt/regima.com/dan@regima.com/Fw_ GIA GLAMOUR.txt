Dearest Jacqui 

Herewith the 7 questions.

1.	Women's Month celebrates strength and resilience. What does Women Empowerment mean to you personally, and how has it shaped your journey in creating RégimA?
In 1990  I left the shores of my birth with a vision of my new life in my new land. Since I was a young nurse and even in the Red Cross as a teenager, I always wanted to help people, make their lives better somehow, you may say it has been a calling. I have always had a passion for helping to heal those who are either injured, or less fortunate.  Being a woman entering, at that time, what was a male dominated industry, in quite a male dominated country and only speaking English it could have been daunting.  Notice I said, could have been.  However, growing up in Manchester makes one a little bit tough.  I am not what one would call ‘a shrinking violet, in other words not shy and retiring, always having confidence, thank goodness.  So, I would stress to all young women entering this business, or any similar, to have confidence in themselves and their knowledge.  Obviously I knew my stuff and thank goodness for my Grammar School education, so ensure you know what you are talking about, especially because I was going to try and engage with doctors, so I definitely had to know what I was talking about.  The first thing I did was talk to patients after they had surgery and then to create SCAR REPAIR and ANTI-STRETCH COMPLEX.  When creating products do not look at the costing, rather look at the action of your product.  It must do what you are claiming, which mine did, so when I spoke to plastic surgeons, I could answer all their questions and I offered to help their patients.  Make yourself indispensable!  That is what I did and it worked.  It is not just about making a sale that gets you remembered.    I ensured they would remember my name and my product.  My journey was definitely on track.   The  You must listen to the doctors and their patients or whoever your future clients are going to be, to find out what was needed, what would tick all the boxes.  The plastic surgeons I met in those early days and their patients are still clients of mine today, which shows I have built strength and have resilience, and maintained that within a very tough industry.

2. As a woman pioneering in the medical science and skincare industry, what were some of the biggest challenges you faced, and how did you overcome them?

3. Women's Day is about inspiring future generations. What advice would you give to young women aspiring to make their mark in a male-dominated industry or to start their own business?

4. You’ve dedicated much of your life to treating wounds and changing lives through your products. How has this act of giving shaped your definition of success as a woman in business?

5. Many women struggle with self-confidence, especially in leadership roles. What key lessons have you learned about believing in yourself and your vision, even when facing criticism or doubt?

6. RégimA has grown into a global name while staying true to its roots of honesty, integrity, and passion. How do you believe women can use these values to uplift and empower each other in business and beyond?

7. This Women's Month, as we celebrate women who make a difference, what legacy do you hope to leave behind for the next generation of female leaders, innovators, and changemakers?
