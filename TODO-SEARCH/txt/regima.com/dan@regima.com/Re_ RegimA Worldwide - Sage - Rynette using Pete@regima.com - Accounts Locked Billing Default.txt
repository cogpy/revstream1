There is an additional statement to 4 Oct that became available yesterday so the personal bank statement period is extended.
Also I thin k the 2 screenshots need to be added.
The important thing is that we file the oppositions to the existing interdicts and load the evidence onto Caselines.
I only found out about Caselines yesterday reading one of the emails. I haven't seen it or anything on it.
Warm Regards
Dan

Are these new documents or were they given to Natan from the bundle prepared?

	Attached please find Daniel Faucitt personal bank records for months preceding, including and following the 500k loan transfer. The balance on 16 July speaks for itself in terms of timing.
	Peter is intentionally trying to jump to the position of what mental conditions could cause spending on compulsive gambling and porn despite the hard evidence demonstrating all the company IT expenses being paid from my personal account.
	Thus the main priority is submitting the actual evidence and refuting the central claim as proven false.
	Warm Regards,
	Dan

	See Attached screenshots from June 2025 & August 2025 showing Rynette Farrar using Pete@regima.com email as "owner" of the account blocking access and preventing further resolution of invoices with account audit trail.
