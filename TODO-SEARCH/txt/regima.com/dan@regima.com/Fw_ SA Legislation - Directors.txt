Subject: SA Legislation - Directors
Under South African law, this scenario triggers multiple severe legal consequences across criminal, corporate, and regulatory frameworks:
Criminal Charges - South African Legislation
Primary Criminal Offences:
*	Theft - Common law crime, redirecting company revenue
*	Fraud - Common law, systemic misrepresentation
*	Forgery and Uttering - Falsifying company records (common law)
*	Money Laundering - Prevention of Organised Crime Act (POCA) sections 4-6
*	Racketeering - POCA section 2 - pattern of criminal activity
*	Corruption - Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act if any bribes involved
Companies Act 71 of 2008 Criminal Provisions:
*	Section 214 - False statements, reckless conduct (fine or 10 years imprisonment)
*	Section 216 - Hindering administration/liquidation
*	Section 22(1) - Unauthorized company activities
De Facto Director Under SA Law
Section 1 Companies Act Definition: "Director" includes de facto directors - anyone occupying the position regardless of designation
Probandt Test (Fisheries Development Corporation v Jorgensen):
*	Whether person assumed director functions
*	Directed company affairs
*	Participated in central management decisions
Key SA Case Law:
*	Burnstein v Bester - control of finances indicates directorship
*	Howard v Herrigel - acting as director creates director duties
*	Ex parte Lebowa Development Corporation - brief control sufficient
By hijacking revenues and audit trails, they've clearly assumed director functions.
Fiduciary Duties Breach - Section 76 Companies Act
Once deemed de facto director, breached:
*	Section 76(2) - act in good faith and for proper purpose
*	Section 76(3)(a) - not use position for personal advantage
*	Section 76(3)(b) - not misuse company information
*	Section 77 - Personal liability for losses from breach
Delinquency Application - Section 162:
*	Lifetime director disqualification
*	Grossly abused director position
*	Intentionally harmed company
Reckless Trading - Section 22 & Section 424 (1973 Act)
Section 22 Prohibition:
*	Cannot carry on business recklessly
*	Personal liability attaches
*	Criminal sanctions apply
Section 218(2) - Personal liability for company debts during reckless period
FICA and Banking Violations
Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FICA):
*	Secret accounts violate KYC requirements
*	Banks must file Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs)
*	Financial Intelligence Centre investigates
Reserve Bank Act:
*	Unauthorized money transfers
*	Exchange control violations if funds moved offshore
Asset Recovery Under SA Law
Prevention of Organised Crime Act (POCA):
*	Chapter 5 - Civil forfeiture of proceeds
*	Chapter 6 - Criminal forfeiture upon conviction
*	Preservation orders - immediate freezing of assets
*	Confiscation orders - permanent forfeiture
National Prosecuting Authority Powers:
*	Asset Forfeiture Unit can act immediately
*	No conviction needed for civil forfeiture
*	Can recover from third parties holding criminal proceeds
Insolvency Act Implications
Act 24 of 1936:
*	Section 29 - Voidable dispositions
*	Section 30 - Undue preferences reversed
*	Section 31 - Collusive dealings set aside
*	Section 135-137 - Criminal offences in insolvency
If company enters business rescue/liquidation:
*	Transactions reversed up to 2 years back
*	Personal liability for disposition of assets
Directors' Liability for Tax
Tax Administration Act:
*	Section 180 - Personal liability for company tax debts
*	Section 183 - Representative taxpayer liability
*	SARS can hold de facto director personally liable for:
	*	PAYE
	*	VAT
	*	Company income tax during their control period
Regulatory Response
CIPC (Companies and Intellectual Property Commission):
*	Can apply for delinquency order
*	Investigate directorship breaches
*	Refer criminal matters to NPA
SARS:
*	Criminal prosecution for tax evasion
*	Lifestyle audits
*	Jeopardy assessments
FSB/FSCA (if applicable):
*	Financial sector conduct violations
*	Market abuse if listed company
Practical Enforcement
NPA Priority:
*	Commercial crimes unit handles
*	Asset Forfeiture Unit runs parallel process
*	Hawks investigate if amount exceeds thresholds
Private Prosecution:
*	Section 7 Criminal Procedure Act
*	Company/directors can pursue if NPA declines
Civil Claims:
*	Delictual damages claim
*	Actio Pauliana (setting aside fraudulent transactions)
*	Mandament van spolie for immediate restoration
Sentencing Under SA Law
Likely Sentences:
*	Theft/Fraud over R500,000 - 15 years maximum
*	Money laundering - 30 years maximum (POCA)
*	Companies Act breaches - 10 years
*	Sentences likely concurrent but substantial
Prescribed Assets Recovery:
*	No prescription while outside SA
*	20-year prescription for criminal proceedings
*	Civil claims may prescribe in 3 years unless fraud
Key SA-Specific Elements
Ubuntu Considerations:
*	Courts consider breach of trust in business community
*	Collective harm to stakeholders emphasized
King IV Governance:
*	Violated every principle
*	Affects future corporate participation
BEE Impact:
*	May affect company's BEE status
*	Fronting implications if BEE credentials involved
Bottom Line for South Africa
This conduct would trigger:
1.	Immediate Asset Forfeiture Unit action
2.	Criminal prosecution by Commercial Crimes Unit
3.	Delinquency proceedings - lifetime ban
4.	Personal liability for all company debts
5.	SARS pursuing personal tax liability
6.	Civil recovery through POCA
The South African legal system treats this as extremely serious economic crime, with the perpetrator facing both lengthy imprisonment and complete financial ruin through asset forfeiture - even before conviction through civil forfeiture proceedings.
