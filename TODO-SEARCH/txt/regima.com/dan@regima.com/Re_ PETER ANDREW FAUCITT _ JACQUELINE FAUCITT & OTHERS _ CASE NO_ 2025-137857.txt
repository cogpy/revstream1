Subject:	Re: PETER ANDREW FAUCITT / JACQUELINE FAUCITT & OTHERS // CASE NO: 2025-137857

Here is the inline document in case it didn't attach correctly.
We need to make some amendments but i'm doing the best I can to provide an outline of what needs to be raised and challenged.
We just need some help with how each point should be made and what the strongest evidence would be in each instance.

1. INTRODUCTION AND PRELIMINARY MATTERS
1.1
I am JACQUELINE FAUCITT, the First Respondent in this matter, an adult female with identity number 570607 0998 18 1.
1.2
I am duly authorized to depose to this affidavit on behalf of myself and the Second Respondent, DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT, who has knowledge of and confirms the contents hereof.
1.3
The facts herein contained are, save where the context indicates otherwise or where specifically stated to be based on information and belief, within my personal knowledge and are to the best of my knowledge and belief both true and correct.
1.4
I have read the founding affidavit of the Applicant dated 14 August 2025 and deny all allegations therein contained save for those specifically admitted herein.
1.5
At the outset, I must place on record that the entire application and the interdict obtained therefrom is void ab initio due to perjury and fraud perpetrated upon this Honourable Court.
________________________________
2. VOIDNESS OF THE INTERDICT DUE TO PERJURY AND FRAUD
2.1 Documentary Proof of Email Control Deception
2.1.1
The Applicant alleges throughout his founding affidavit that he received various communications and had knowledge of certain matters through emails sent to his email address Pete@regima.com <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__replit.com_-40marduk2_Hyperdict-3FmobileBridge-3D1-26hideBottomBar-3D1-26forceTheme-3DreplitDark-26errorTrace-3D3302d1df-2D025f-2D4f33-2D87ed-2D4d931954d085-26mobileWebview-3D1-26supportsUpsellBridge-3D1-26permissionRequest-3D1-26speechRecognition-3D1-26workspace2-3D1-26webviewBridge-3D1-26storeReviewPrompt-3D1-23interdialytics_mailto-3APete-40regima.com&d=DwMFAg&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=7ZULBZmD5L4dM8U3nU-5WA&m=Uwle6-zo-i6foX5Zz7whSVDMSuWX20emDjPvy5HHxJOqT0AVJNTOvbq5n9QY23YJ&s=ypeeNuwRWwoRp7FBiohInu-KbpYOeej7RF9KE6Fepsk&e=> .
2.1.2
Documentary evidence in the form of Sage Account system screenshots dated 20 June 2025 proves conclusively that the email address Pete@regima.com <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__replit.com_-40marduk2_Hyperdict-3FmobileBridge-3D1-26hideBottomBar-3D1-26forceTheme-3DreplitDark-26errorTrace-3D3302d1df-2D025f-2D4f33-2D87ed-2D4d931954d085-26mobileWebview-3D1-26supportsUpsellBridge-3D1-26permissionRequest-3D1-26speechRecognition-3D1-26workspace2-3D1-26webviewBridge-3D1-26storeReviewPrompt-3D1-23interdialytics_mailto-3APete-40regima.com&d=DwMFAg&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=7ZULBZmD5L4dM8U3nU-5WA&m=Uwle6-zo-i6foX5Zz7whSVDMSuWX20emDjPvy5HHxJOqT0AVJNTOvbq5n9QY23YJ&s=ypeeNuwRWwoRp7FBiohInu-KbpYOeej7RF9KE6Fepsk&e=>  is not controlled by the Applicant but is instead controlled by one Rynette Farrar.
2.1.3
The system access control panel explicitly shows:

2.1.4
It is therefore physically impossible for the Applicant to have directly received any emails sent to Pete@regima.com <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__replit.com_-40marduk2_Hyperdict-3FmobileBridge-3D1-26hideBottomBar-3D1-26forceTheme-3DreplitDark-26errorTrace-3D3302d1df-2D025f-2D4f33-2D87ed-2D4d931954d085-26mobileWebview-3D1-26supportsUpsellBridge-3D1-26permissionRequest-3D1-26speechRecognition-3D1-26workspace2-3D1-26webviewBridge-3D1-26storeReviewPrompt-3D1-23interdialytics_mailto-3APete-40regima.com&d=DwMFAg&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=7ZULBZmD5L4dM8U3nU-5WA&m=Uwle6-zo-i6foX5Zz7whSVDMSuWX20emDjPvy5HHxJOqT0AVJNTOvbq5n9QY23YJ&s=ypeeNuwRWwoRp7FBiohInu-KbpYOeej7RF9KE6Fepsk&e=>  as he claims in his founding affidavit.
2.1.5
Every instance where the Applicant claims direct knowledge through email receipt constitutes perjury, as he could not have received these communications directly.
2.2 Information Manipulation and Misrepresentation
2.2.1
The evidence demonstrates that the Applicant has been subjected to systematic information manipulation through intermediaries who control his communications.
2.2.2
The Applicant's knowledge is based entirely on filtered and potentially manipulated information provided by Rynette Farrar and other intermediaries, not on direct observation or communication.
2.2.3
The screenshot dated 25 August 2025 further confirms this control structure, stating: "To activate your account, please contact Rynette Farrar who is the subscription owner for this registration."
2.3 Confirmatory Affidavit Contamination
2.3.1
The Applicant relies heavily on the confirmatory affidavit of one Daniel Jacobus Bantjies (marked "PF5" in the founding papers).
2.3.2
Evidence demonstrates that Mr. Bantjies had knowledge of criminal matters, including allegations of murder and fraud, by 10 June 2025.
2.3.3
Despite this knowledge, Mr. Bantjies proceeded to provide a confirmatory affidavit supporting allegations he knew to be incomplete and misleading, constituting perjury.
2.4 Legal Effect of Perjury
2.4.1
It is trite law that perjury in founding affidavits renders the entire application and any order granted thereon void ab initio.
2.4.2
The interdict obtained on 19 August 2025 is therefore void and of no force or effect.
2.4.3
The applicant is attempting to accelerate the proceedings, filing additional interdicts and false claims before the Respondents have an opportunity to prepare the necessary evidence to file a comprehensive response.
________________________________
3. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED UNEXPLAINED IT EXPENSES
3.1
The Applicant alleges at paragraphs 7.4 to 7.8 of his founding affidavit that there were "numerous irregular payments" and "unexplained" IT expenses totalling R6,738,007.47 for 2024 and R2,116,159.47 for 2025.
3.2
These allegations are comprehensively refuted by the following documentary evidence:
3.2.1 Legitimate Business Expenses
All IT expenses were legitimate business expenses necessary for the operation of an international distribution company with:
*	Multiple e-commerce platforms requiring substantial infrastructure
*	International payment processing systems
*	Cloud storage and backup systems
*	Cybersecurity measures appropriate for handling sensitive customer data
*	Software licenses for business operations
3.2.2 Documentary Evidence
Invoices and supporting documentation for these expenses exist and include:
*	Shopify Plus subscription services for RegimA SA and RegimA WW+Zone stores
*	Web Services, hosting and infrastructure
*	Microsoft 365 Business licenses for all staff
*	Adobe Creative Cloud for marketing materials
*	Sage accounting software (which the Applicant admits is legitimate at paragraph 8.2)
*	Domain registrations and SSL certificates
*	Payment gateway fees (Stripe, PayPal, Peach Payments)
3.2.3 International Nature of Business
The Applicant's allegation at paragraph 8.7 that expenses were "seemingly international" ignores the documented fact that:
*	RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd operates internationally
*	The company has international regulatory obligations
*	International payment processing and infrastructure are essential business requirements
*	The Reserve Bank allocations referenced confirm legitimate international business operations
3.3
The Applicant's claim at paragraph 8.4 that "we have almost no invoices for these items" is false. All invoices were available but the Applicant:
*	Cancelled access cards preventing proper record retrieval (paragraph 7.5)
*	Obtained a court order
*	Refused to engage with explanations provided
*	Relied on intermediaries who filtered information
*	Many of the accounts are held by Kayla Pretorius who was murdered in 2023 and we were instructed to hand logins to investigators and touch nothing until law enforcement has completed the investigation
________________________________
4. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED UNAUTHORIZED BIRTHDAY GIFT
4.1
The Applicant alleges at paragraph 7.18 that the First Respondent transferred R500,000.00 to the Second Respondent as an unauthorized "birthday gift."
4.2
This allegation is refuted as follows:
4.2.1 Authorized Director Remuneration
The payment was not a "gift" but constituted authorized director's loan:
*	Second Respondent made the First Respondent aware of the situation
*	Recorded in company bank accounts to ensure audit trail compliance
*	Necessary to prevent defaulting creditor payments leading to insolvent status
*	Consistent with the sudden escalation of personal payments to creditors
4.2.2 First Respondent's Authority
As a co-director and member of the close corporation, the First Respondent had full authority to approve necessary loans in accordance with:
*	The Close Corporations Act provisions
*	The corporations' founding statements
*	Established company practice over decades
4.2.3 Pattern of Selective Memory
The Applicant's characterization of legitimate director loan as a "gift" demonstrates either:
*	Deliberate misrepresentation to the Court, or
*	Cognitive impairment affecting his ability to recall business decisions
________________________________
5. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED INTERFERENCE WITH STAFF
5.1
The Applicant alleges at paragraphs 7.9 to 7.14 that the Respondents interfered with corporate staff and withheld email access.
5.2
These allegations are comprehensively refuted:
5.2.1 Protection of Business Continuity
Following the Applicant's erratic behaviour in cancelling payment cards (paragraph 7.5), which caused:
*	Domain names to lapse
*	Essential services to be terminated
*	Business email systems to fail
*	Customer communications to be disrupted
Emergency measures were required to restore business operations.
5.2.2 Restoration of Services
The Second Respondent worked to:
*	Restore domain registrations using personal funds
*	Reinstate email services for all staff
*	Maintain business continuity
*	Protect customer relationships
5.2.3 Staff Communication
Documentary evidence shows that:
*	All staff maintained email access except during the period of the Applicant's card cancellations
*	Staff communications continued normally once services were restored
*	Rynette Farrar impersonation of Pete@regima.com <mailto:Pete@regima.com>  email flagged a security hold on Rynette and Linda emails pending investigation
*	RegimA Worldwide Distribution itself has No staff members
5.3
The allegation of "interference" is projection by the Applicant, who himself interfered with business operations through impulsive card cancellations. The company responsible for payment of worldwide email accounts was sabotaged by the Applicant who then attempted the hold the company liable for disruption caused to staff in a completely different company.
________________________________
6. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED WITHHOLDING OF DOCUMENTATION
6.1
The Applicant alleges at paragraphs 7.5 and 8.2 that documentation and invoices were withheld.
6.2
This allegation is false:
6.2.1 Self-Created Access Problem
The Applicant himself created the documentation access problem by:
*	Cancelling payment cards linked to cloud storage accounts
*	Causing accounting software subscriptions to lapse
*	Terminating document management systems
*	Refusing to maintain essential business services
6.2.2 Documentation Availability
All documentation was and remains available through:
*	Cloud storage systems (once restored after Applicant's cancellations)
*	Accounting software records
*	Email archives
*	Physical files at company premises
6.2.3 Selective Documentation Request
The Applicant's selective request for only IT-related invoices while ignoring other expense categories demonstrates:
*	Predetermined narrative construction
*	Cherry-picking of information
*	Bad faith in the application
________________________________
7. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT
7.1
The Applicant makes sweeping allegations of financial misconduct without providing specific evidence of any actual misappropriation.
7.2
The true position is:
7.2.1 Profitable Operations
The corporations' financial records demonstrate:
*	Consistent profitability over multiple years
*	Growing revenue streams (2M->12M->19M)
*	Successful international expansion
*	Proper tax compliance (until disrupted by Applicant's actions)
7.2.2 External Validation
The corporations have been audited and reviewed by:
*	External accountants
*	SARS tax compliance
*	Banking institutions
*	No findings of misconduct have been made
7.2.3 Applicant's Financial Mismanagement
Conversely, the Applicant's actions have caused financial harm:
*	Disrupting payment systems and forcing companies into insolvency
*	Causing service lapses and denying Respondents access to records
*	Damaging vendor relationships and POPIA violations
*	Creating tax compliance issues through his interference
________________________________
8. REFUTATION OF ALLEGED BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTIES
8.1
The Applicant alleges at paragraphs 10.1 to 10.10 various breaches of fiduciary duties citing the Companies Act and Close Corporations Act.
8.2
These allegations are without merit:
8.2.1 Business Judgment Rule
All decisions made by the Respondents were:
*	In good faith
*	For proper purpose
*	In the best interests of the companies
*	Based on reasonable business judgment
8.2.2 Collective Decision Making
As equal members/directors, both the Applicant and First Respondent have equal say in corporate matters. The Applicant cannot unilaterally:
*	Declare the other director's decisions invalid
*	Impose his will without proper resolution
*	Bypass corporate governance procedures
8.2.3 Absence of Delinquency
None of the conduct alleged meets the threshold for delinquency or probation under section 162 of the Companies Act:
*	No gross abuse of position
*	No intentional harm to the companies
*	No wilful misconduct or breach of trust
________________________________
9. DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE OF INFORMATION MANIPULATION
9.1 Email Hijacking Evidence
9.1.1
System access records dated 20 June 2025 prove conclusively that Pete@regima.com <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__replit.com_-40marduk2_Hyperdict-3FmobileBridge-3D1-26hideBottomBar-3D1-26forceTheme-3DreplitDark-26errorTrace-3D3302d1df-2D025f-2D4f33-2D87ed-2D4d931954d085-26mobileWebview-3D1-26supportsUpsellBridge-3D1-26permissionRequest-3D1-26speechRecognition-3D1-26workspace2-3D1-26webviewBridge-3D1-26storeReviewPrompt-3D1-23interdialytics_mailto-3APete-40regima.com&d=DwMFAg&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=7ZULBZmD5L4dM8U3nU-5WA&m=Uwle6-zo-i6foX5Zz7whSVDMSuWX20emDjPvy5HHxJOqT0AVJNTOvbq5n9QY23YJ&s=ypeeNuwRWwoRp7FBiohInu-KbpYOeej7RF9KE6Fepsk&e=>  is controlled by Rynette Farrar, not the Applicant.
9.1.2
This constitutes identity theft and email hijacking, with Rynette Farrar impersonating the Applicant in communications.
9.2 Pattern of Manipulation
9.2.1
The evidence reveals a pattern where:
*	Information is filtered through intermediaries
*	The Applicant receives selective, potentially altered information
*	Critical context is withheld from the Applicant
*	False narratives are constructed and fed to the Applicant
9.3 Professional Misconduct
9.3.1
Evidence dated 29 August 2025 shows that ENS Africa attorneys:
*	Received written notice of serious criminal matters
*	Acknowledged receipt with "Received, thanks Daniel"
*	Proceeded to suppress this information
*	Perpetrated fraud upon the Court
9.3.2
This constitutes professional misconduct warranting:
*	Report to the Legal Practice Council
*	Criminal investigation for defeating the ends of justice
*	Drafting agreements to seize control of bodily autonomy
________________________________

Dear Nate, Doron, Ian
Here is a draft of some of the main points that we need to address. The main issue is that we are denied access by the Applicant so it takes longer to put the necessary supporting evidence together. Peter is attempting to accelerate the whole process to prevent evidence from being seen by the court. Already another interdict has been issued where he already includes a predetermined psychological assessment specified by his own assertions. I have all my personal banking records to refute the claims entirely so we need to submit the evidence proving the claims are false, not follow his speculative delusions down the rabbit hole.
Warm Regards
Dan
