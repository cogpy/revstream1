Subject: PETER ANDREW FAUCITT / JACQUELINE FAUCITT & OTHERS // DRAFT ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT 
Dear Jacqui and Daniel, 
Please find attached a draft answering affidavit to support the reconsideration. 
Kindly note that we have had difficulty of making sense of the various documents and emailed supplied and require a detailed note to be prepared, referencing the documents as to how Rynette and Peter have been defrauding the businesses. 
This note must also include references to when and how you both uncovered the fraud as we will need to motivate to the Court why the reconsideration must be dealt with on an urgent basis – this will explain the full period of the delay. 
Please attend to this urgently as the documents are needed to substantiate some of the allegations made in the affidavit. 
Please can we have the note by no later than Sunday morning so Doron and I can try settle the draft in order to issue same. 

Kind regards,

NATAN BACK
