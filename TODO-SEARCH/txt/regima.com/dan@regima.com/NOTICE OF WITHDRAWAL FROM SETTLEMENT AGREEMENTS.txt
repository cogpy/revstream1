**RE: CASE NO. 2025-137857 - NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL FROM SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS DATED 18 SEPTEMBER 2025**
Dear Sirs,
We refer to the above matter and the purported settlement agreements signed on 18 September 2025.
## 1. WITHDRAWAL FROM AGREEMENTS
We hereby give notice of our immediate withdrawal from all settlement agreements signed on 18 September 2025 based on multiple grounds, each independently sufficient to void these agreements.
## 2. GROUNDS FOR WITHDRAWAL
### 2.1 IMMEDIATE FUNDAMENTAL BREACH BY PETER FAUCITT
On 19 September 2025, merely one day after signing, Peter Faucitt materially breached the settlement by:
- Physically preventing Jacqueline Faucitt from performing her legal duties regarding POPIA compliance
- Claiming he "controls all the companies now" - exceeding his financial-only mandate under the interdict
- Assaulting an employee by grabbing their phone
- Obstructing legal compliance that could result in R10 million regulatory fines
This immediate repudiation releases us from any obligations.
### 2.2 MATERIAL NON-DISCLOSURE
We have discovered that material information was deliberately withheld:
- **June 10, 2025 correspondence** between Daniel Faucitt and Danie Bantjies regarding financial irregularities was not disclosed
- **R12,330,131.18 was transferred** from supposedly protected accounts on September 11, 2025 - seven days before mediation
- These material facts were known to your client and his advisors but concealed from us
This non-disclosure vitiates any consent.
### 2.3 DURESS AND COERCION
The agreements were signed under duress:
- We were told refusing would result in being "bound until 2029 with no earlier relief"
- Medical testing was presented as mandatory for mediation
- We had no meaningful choice
- The true nature of proceedings was misrepresented
### 2.4 ABSENCE OF LEGITIMATE DISPUTES
Review of correspondence reveals no actual disputes existed:
- June 2025 emails show collaborative investigation of financial irregularities
- Matters raised were crimes requiring investigation, not interpersonal disputes
- No Terms of Reference defined any disputes
- Nothing was actually "settled"
Without defined disputes, the settlement lacks consideration and serves no purpose.
### 2.5 IMPOSSIBLE AND UNCERTAIN TERMS
The agreements contain:
- No defined scope or disputes being resolved
- Vague, uncertain provisions
- Medical requirements inappropriate for business matters
- Mixed therapeutic and legal purposes that are incompatible
These fundamental uncertainties render the agreements void.
### 2.6 PROCEDURAL IRREGULARITIES
The mediation lacked basic procedural requirements:
- No Terms of Reference
- No mediation agreement
- Presented as "family therapy" not legal proceedings
- "Off-the-record" nature incompatible with binding agreements
- No clear exchange of consideration
### 2.7 ILLEGALITY AND PUBLIC POLICY
The agreements appear designed to:
- Prevent reporting of crimes to authorities
- Suppress evidence of financial irregularities
- Circumvent legal compliance obligations
Agreements for illegal purposes are void as against public policy.
## 3. LEGAL POSITION
Based on the above, the settlement agreements are:
- **Void ab initio** for illegality, impossibility, and lack of consensus
- **Voidable** for duress, misrepresentation, and non-disclosure
- **Terminated** by Peter Faucitt's immediate fundamental breach
- **Unenforceable** for uncertainty and procedural defects
## 4. DEMANDS
We accordingly demand:
4.1 Immediate written confirmation that the settlement agreements are terminated
4.2 Confirmation that no enforcement will be attempted
4.3 Cancellation of all medical assessments
4.4 Cessation of all actions based on these void agreements
## 5. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS
We reserve all our rights, including but not limited to:
- Seeking urgent court relief if these agreements are not acknowledged as void
- Pursuing claims for damages arising from the breaches
- Reporting relevant matters to appropriate authorities
- Taking any steps necessary to protect our interests
## 6. INTERDICT MATTERS
Separately, we note that the interdict granted on 19 August 2025 appears to have been:
- Obtained based on material non-disclosure
- Exceeded by Peter Faucitt's conduct
- Used for purposes beyond its scope
We reserve our rights regarding appropriate remedies.
## 7. NO ADMISSION
Nothing herein constitutes an admission of any liability or wrongdoing on our part. This notice is served strictly without prejudice to our rights.
## 8. RESPONSE REQUIRED
We require written response by close of business on [Date - 48 hours from sending] confirming:
- The settlement agreements are void and of no effect
- No enforcement will be attempted
- All related processes are cancelled
Failure to respond or any attempt to enforce these void agreements will result in immediate application to court for appropriate relief, including costs on a punitive scale.
## 9. FUTURE CORRESPONDENCE
Given the seriousness of these matters and our safety concerns, all future correspondence must be directed through our legal representatives [once appointed - details to follow].
Yours faithfully,
**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT**
