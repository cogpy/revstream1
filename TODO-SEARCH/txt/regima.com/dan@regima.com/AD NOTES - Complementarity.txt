---
## Cognitive Synergy Points
### Point 1: Timeline Convergence
- **Jax:** 15 May confrontation → 22 May data expungement (7 days) → 29 May domain theft (14 days)
- **Dan:** 6 June fraud exposure → 7 June card cancellation (1 day) → 10 June audit dismissal (4 days)
- **Synergy:** Both timelines show immediate retaliation after investigating/exposing fraud
### Point 2: Bantjies's Multiple Roles
- **Jax:** Discovers Bantjies is undisclosed trustee, learns of debt to trust
- **Dan:** Reports fraud to Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator), receives audit dismissal
- **Synergy:** Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery
### Point 3: Rynette's Control Structure
- **Jax:** Rynette made false statement about debt, facilitated "Main Trustee" document
- **Dan:** Rynette controlled systems using Peter's email, claimed to act under Bantjies's instructions
- **Synergy:** Rynette operated under Bantjies's instructions, not Peter's
### Point 4: Adderory's Role
- **Jax:** Domain regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory 14 days after confrontation
- **Dan:** R5.4M stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics, same type supplied by Adderory
- **Synergy:** Rynette's son's company benefited from both domain theft and stock transfer pricing
### Point 5: Manufactured Crisis
- **Jax:** Substituted personal card to prevent business collapse after Peter's card cancellation
- **Dan:** Card cancellation occurred day after cooperation, rendered documentation inaccessible
- **Synergy:** Peter created the crisis he complains about (venire contra factum proprium)
### Point 6: UK Operations Truth
- **Jax:** Aware of UK company's role in funding operations
- **Dan:** Provides Shopify invoices and UK bank transactions proving UK → SA payment flow
- **Synergy:** Peter's claim that UK owes SA is demonstrably false (perjury)
### Point 7: Kayla's Estate
- **Jax:** R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate, "profiting from proceeds of murder"
- **Dan:** Kayla co-built R34.9M operations, murdered 13 July 2023, email seized by court order
- **Synergy:** Debt to murdered partner's estate unpaid while operations sabotaged
### Point 8: Punishment Pattern
- **Jax:** Included in interdict 2 days after signing document, 3 months after debt inquiry
- **Dan:** Six-month sabotage campaign after fraud exposure
- **Synergy:** Both punished by co-trustees for fulfilling duties
