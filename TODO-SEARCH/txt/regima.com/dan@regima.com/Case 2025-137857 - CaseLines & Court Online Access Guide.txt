Re: URGENT - Case 2025-137857 - CaseLines Access Required
I am Daniel James Faucitt (ID: 820715 5300 18 2), Second Respondent in the above matter.
My attorneys withdrew on September 24, 2025. The Applicant has now brought an urgent application for forced medical testing, which I must oppose within 24 hours.
I urgently require CaseLines access to:
1.	Review the latest application
2.	File my opposition
3.	Protect my constitutional rights
This is extremely urgent as the application seeks to violate my dignity and constitutional rights.
Please provide login credentials immediately.
