Dear Danny,

Thank you for your mail and my sincere apologies for the silly spelling errors – the mind boggles!  Anyway, I have made the necessary adjustments to the document and a corrected copy is attached.

Danny, to say I have shocked by this course of events is a gross understatement.  Sadly, I continue to be evermore disillusion at the “development” (which, more correctly, should be “regression”) of the human race, which is why I choose to have very few people in my life who mean a lot to me, but I never saw your dad as someone who was primarily driven by money and power, even if it means sacrificing the really important things is life, which are family and friends.

I had a long chat to mom this morning and I gave her my unequivocal assurance of my absolute loyalty to her and yourself, and that will always be my position in this matter.  Your mom is a remarkable woman, for whom I have the utmost respect and admiration, and I will do anything that I can do to assist you both in helping the RégimA brand to go onto bigger and better things in the future!

With my very warmest wishes and love to you and mom.....

John
