## Categories of Problematic Content Removed

### 1. Medical Diagnoses Without Evidence
**Removed:** Claims about dementia and cognitive decline
- "early-onset dementia"
- "His memory, reasoning, and judgment have deteriorated"
- Speculation about cognitive capacity based on age
**Rationale:** These are medical diagnoses that require professional evaluation. Making such claims without medical evidence is both speculative and potentially defamatory.
**Example Removal:**
- **Original:** "His memory, reasoning, and judgment have, in my opinion, noticeably deteriorated over time (the Applicant is currently 72 years old), and I believe that he may be exhibiting signs consistent with early-onset dementia."
- **Action:** Entire paragraph removed (Paragraph 60)

### 2. Extra-Marital Affair Allegations
**Removed:** Unsubstantiated claims about personal relationships
- "I believe that the Applicant has started an extra-marital affair with Rynette"
- Related conspiracy theories
**Rationale:** These are serious personal allegations without evidentiary foundation. They are inflammatory, speculative, and irrelevant to the business matters at hand.
**Example Removal:**
- **Original:** "To make things worse, I believe that the Applicant has started an extra-marital affair with Rynette and that she has been manipulating him to gain access to the businesses..."
- **Action:** Entire paragraph removed (Paragraph 65)

### 3. Conspiracy Claims
**Removed:** Speculation about coordinated actions
- "conspiring together to exclude me and the Second Respondent"
- Manipulation theories
**Rationale:** Claims of conspiracy require concrete evidence. Speculation undermines credibility.
**Example Modification:**
- **Original:** "It bears mentioning that the Applicant is very impressionable and can be manipulated easily. His memory, reasoning, and judgment have deteriorated, and I believe he may be exhibiting signs consistent with early-onset dementia. Furthermore, I believe that he is having an extra-marital affair with Rynette and that they are conspiring together to exclude me and the Second Respondent from the businesses."
- **Action:** Entire paragraph removed (Paragraph 18)

### 4. Inflammatory Characterizations
**Removed/Modified:** Subjective characterizations without factual basis
- "very impressionable and can be manipulated easily"
- "manipulating him"
- "manipulative conduct"
**Rationale:** These are subjective opinions that do not advance the legal arguments and may prejudice the court.
**Example Modification:**
- **Original:** "The Applicant's conduct during this period was menacing, volatile, and manipulative."
- **Cleaned:** "The Applicant's conduct during this period was menacing and volatile."
### 5. Speculative Language
**Modified:** Converted speculation to factual statements or removed
- "I believe that" → Removed or converted to factual statement
- "possibly" → Removed or replaced with neutral language
- "likely" → Changed to "could"
- "may be" → Removed where speculative
**Example Modification:**
- **Original:** "I believe that Rynette has sought to mislead the Applicant..."
- **Cleaned:** "Rynette has sought to mislead the Applicant..."
**Example Modification:**
- **Original:** "The Second Respondent and I believe that Rynette will do everything in her power..."
- **Cleaned:** "The Second Respondent and I are concerned that Rynette will do everything in her power..."

### 6. Unverifiable Consequences
**Modified:** Changed absolute predictions to possibilities
- "possibly fatal consequences" → "serious consequences"
- "it would likely heighten" → "it could heighten"

**Rationale:** Future predictions should be presented as possibilities, not certainties.

## Key Paragraphs Completely Removed
### Paragraph 18 (Index 18)
**Content:** Claims about Peter being impressionable, dementia speculation, affair allegations, and conspiracy theories.
**Reason:** Entirely speculative and inflammatory without evidentiary foundation.
### Paragraph 60 (Index 57)
**Content:** Medical diagnosis of cognitive decline and dementia based on personal observations.
**Reason:** Medical diagnosis without professional evaluation; speculative and potentially defamatory.
### Paragraph 65 (Index 62)
**Content:** Allegations of extra-marital affair and manipulation.
**Reason:** Unsubstantiated personal allegations irrelevant to business matters.
