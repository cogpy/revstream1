RWD REVENUE INTEGRITY ANALYSIS
Below is a primary issue relating to the legitimacy of Revenues claimed by RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd since the revenue streams originate from the Shopify platform owned and paid for by Daniel Faucitt's independently owned UK entity RegimA Zone Ltd and Peter is questioning the legitimacy of the sales channels used by RWD to generate invoices and report tax revenue. If his claims are valid then how can any revenue generated on these platforms belong to RWD?

Priority: 1 - Critical
Topic: RegimA Worldwide Distribution Revenue Legitimacy Questions
Context: Addressing Peter's Central Premise on Financial Allegations
________________________________
Overview
This document addresses fundamental questions about RegimA Worldwide Distribution (RWD) revenue integrity that Peter must answer given his allegations about IT expenses and the R500K payment. If Peter questions RWD's expenditures, then the legitimacy and structure of RWD's revenues must similarly be subjected to scrutiny.
________________________________
Critical Questions Peter Must Answer
1. RWD's Trust Structure vs. RegimA SA (RSA)
Question: Does Peter claim that RegimA Worldwide Distribution operates differently to RegimA SA?
Analysis:
*	
	RSA Structure: RegimA SA operates with a structure where all moneys entering its bank account are held in trust for distribution to beneficiaries:
*	
	RegimA Skin Treatments (Manufacturer)
*	
	Dermal Skin (Distributor)
*	
	RWD Structure: If RWD operates similarly as a trust vehicle:
*	
	RWD should hold revenues in trust for distribution to beneficiaries
*	
	RWD should not appropriate funds as its own
*	
	RWD should maintain clear accounting of trust distributions
Peter's Inconsistency:
*	Peter questions RWD expenditures as if RWD owns the funds absolutely
*	Peter fails to acknowledge RWD's potential trust structure similar to RSA
*	If RWD is a trust vehicle, then questioning individual expenditures without considering trust obligations is misleading
________________________________
2. RWD's Revenue Generation Capacity
Question: Can Peter provide proof that RegimA Worldwide Distribution generated the revenue claimed as distinct from moneys in its bank accounts?
Key Facts:
*	RWD does not hold any stock that it could sell
*	RWD has no inventory or physical assets to generate independent revenue
*	RWD cannot manufacture or distribute products directly
Revenue Reality:
*	RWD issued invoices based on sales made through several stores listed on the Shopify platform
*	Critical Detail: The Shopify platform has been owned and paid for since July 2023 by Daniel Faucitt's independent UK entity RegimA Zone Ltd
*	Daniel's UK company has funded RWD operations continuously (R140K-R280K over 28 months)
Implication: If RWD generated "revenue," these were invoices for sales occurring on a platform:
1.	Owned by Daniel's UK entity (RegimA Zone Ltd)
2.	Paid for by Daniel's UK entity
3.	Operated by Daniel and Jacqueline
4.	Customer relationships managed by Daniel's operations
________________________________
3. RWD's Purpose as Trust Vehicle
Question: If RWD does not operate as a Trust and instead appropriates all funds moving through its accounts as its own, then what purpose does it serve as a vehicle owned by the Faucitt Family Trust?
Analysis:
Scenario A: RWD Operates as Trust
*	Funds are held in trust for distribution to beneficiaries
*	RWD has fiduciary obligations to beneficiaries
*	Expenditures must be evaluated in context of trust administration
*	Peter's allegations ignore trust structure and obligations
Scenario B: RWD Appropriates Funds
*	RWD claims all revenues as its own property
*	No trust structure for distribution
*	Question: What legitimate purpose does RWD serve as a Faucitt Family Trust asset?
*	If RWD operates for personal enrichment, this contradicts trust law principles
Peter's Dilemma:
*	If RWD is a trust → Peter's expenditure allegations lack context of trust obligations
*	If RWD is not a trust → RWD's purpose as trust asset is questionable and potentially fraudulent
________________________________
4. Evidence of Payments to Revenue Source
Question: Can RWD produce evidence of payments made to the entity through which customers placed orders?
Critical Gap:
*	Customers placed orders through Shopify platform owned by Daniel's UK entity (RegimA Zone Ltd)
*	RegimA Zone Ltd paid for the platform infrastructure ($1,000-$2,000+ USD/month)
*	Has RWD ever compensated RegimA Zone Ltd for:
*	Use of the Shopify platform?
*	Customer acquisition costs?
*	Platform hosting and maintenance?
*	Technology infrastructure?
Payment Flow Analysis:
What Should Have Happened:
Customer Order (via RZ Ltd Shopify) 
 → Payment to RWD 
 → RWD pays platform fee to RZ Ltd
 → RWD pays manufacturer (RST)
 → RWD pays distributor (appropriate entity)
What Actually Happened:
Customer Order (via RZ Ltd Shopify)
 → Payment to RWD
 → RWD keeps funds
 → RZ Ltd (Daniel) continues paying Shopify costs
 → No compensation to platform owner (RZ Ltd)
________________________________
5. Payment Discrepancy: Manufacturer vs. Distributor
Question: Can RWD explain why in a similar manner to RSA it paid the Manufacturer (RST) but failed to pay the Distributor whose Customers were using the platform to place orders?
Payment Pattern Analysis:
RegimA SA Model:
*	Pays RegimA Skin Treatments (Manufacturer) ✓
*	Pays Dermal Skin (Distributor) ✓
*	Balanced trust distribution structure
RegimA Worldwide Distribution Model:
*	Pays RegimA Skin Treatments (Manufacturer) ✓
*	FAILS to pay the Distributor (Daniel's UK entities) ✗
*	FAILS to compensate platform owner (RegimA Zone Ltd) ✗
*	Distributor's customers placing orders on distributor's platform
*	Platform costs borne entirely by distributor (Daniel's UK company)
Critical Question: Why was the manufacturer paid but the distributor/platform owner who:
*	Owned the sales platform
*	Paid for the sales infrastructure
*	Managed customer relationships
*	Facilitated all order processing
...was never compensated?
________________________________
6. Alternative Scenario: RSA Tax Fraud
Question: Alternatively, does RSA operate as a trust either, and is Peter's strategic filing of nil income for this entity tax fraud and potential theft?
Analysis:
If Peter argues RWD is NOT a trust structure, then consistency requires examining RSA:
Option A: RSA is a legitimate trust
*	All funds held in trust for distribution
*	Nil income filing is appropriate (trust passthrough)
*	Then RWD should operate similarly
*	Peter's allegations against RWD are inconsistent
Option B: RSA is NOT a trust
*	Filing nil income while receiving revenue = tax fraud
*	Appropriating trust funds as personal income = theft
*	Peter potentially guilty of:
*	Tax evasion
*	Breach of fiduciary duty
*	Misappropriation of funds
Peter's Catch-22:
*	If RSA is a trust → RWD should be treated as trust (Peter's allegations inappropriate)
*	If RSA is not a trust → Peter committed tax fraud with nil income filings
________________________________
Legal Implications
1. Burden of Proof Shifts to Peter
Peter's allegations about RWD expenditures create reciprocal obligation to prove:
1.	Revenue Legitimacy:
*	How RWD generated revenue without stock
*	Evidence of actual revenue vs. invoicing for others' sales
2.	Payment Trail:
*	Evidence of payments to platform owner (RegimA Zone Ltd)
*	Evidence of distributor compensation
*	Justification for manufacturer payment but not distributor payment
3.	Trust Structure Consistency:
*	Whether RWD operates as trust like RSA
*	If not, why RSA files nil income
*	If yes, why trust obligations ignored in expenditure allegations
2. Unjust Enrichment
If RWD appropriated revenues from Daniel's platform without compensation:
*	Unjust Enrichment: RWD received benefit (revenue) without payment to provider
*	Quantum Meruit: Daniel entitled to reasonable value of platform services
*	Breach of Contract: If any agreement existed for platform use
*	Conversion: Unauthorized use of Daniel's business infrastructure
Potential Claims:
*	
	Platform usage fees: ~ USD150,000 (28 months of Shopify costs alone)
*	
	Customer acquisition costs: ?
*	
	Technology infrastructure: ?
*	
	Lost profits: ?
Total Potential Claim: ?
3. Trust Asset Abandonment
Evidence of Trust Abandonment:
1.	No Funding: Trust doesn't fund RWD operations
2.	No Protection: Trust allowed customer hijacking (May 2025)
3.	No Management: Trust didn't protect RWD assets
4.	Daniel's Funding: Daniel's UK entity funded all operations
Legal Consequence:
*	Trust has abandoned RWD as asset
*	Daniel has beneficial ownership through continuous funding
*	Trust cannot claim asset it failed to maintain
*	Daniel can claim RWD ownership

________________________________
Strategic Response Framework
For IT Expense Allegations (PARA 7.2-7.5)
Counter-Argument:
	"Peter questions RWD's expenditures while failing to explain how RWD generated any legitimate revenue. RWD holds no stock, no inventory, and no independent revenue-generating capacity. All sales occurred on a platform owned and paid for by Daniel's UK entity (RegimA Zone Ltd) since July 2023.
	If Peter questions expenditures, he must prove:
	1.	How RWD generated revenue without assets
	2.	Whether RWD compensated the platform owner (Daniel's company)
	3.	Why the distributor was never paid despite facilitating all sales
	4.	Whether RWD operates as a trust like RSA or appropriates funds
	Peter cannot have it both ways: questioning expenditures while ignoring revenue legitimacy."
For R500K Payment Allegations (PARA 7.6-7.11)
Counter-Argument:
	"Peter's allegations about a R500,000 payment ignore fundamental questions about RWD's revenue integrity. If RWD operates as a trust vehicle like RegimA SA, then the payment must be evaluated in context of trust distributions and obligations.
	Moreover, Peter fails to explain why:
	1.	RWD paid the manufacturer (RST) but never the distributor
	2.	RWD never compensated Daniel's UK entity for 28 months of platform costs
	3.	RWD appropriated revenue from sales on Daniel's platform without payment
	The real question is not one payment, but systematic failure to compensate the platform owner and distributor who made all RWD 'revenue' possible."
For Financial Misconduct Allegations (PARA 10.5-10.10.23)
Counter-Argument:
	"Peter's systematic financial misconduct allegations require reciprocal examination of RWD's revenue integrity. Peter must prove:
	1.	Revenue Legitimacy: How RWD generated revenue without stock or assets
	2.	Trust Structure: Whether RWD operates as trust or appropriates funds
	3.	Payment Evidence: Proof of payments to platform owner (RegimA Zone Ltd)
	4.	Distributor Compensation: Why distributor never paid despite facilitating sales
	5.	RSA Consistency: If RWD is not a trust, is RSA's nil income filing tax fraud?
	Peter's allegations collapse under scrutiny when revenue integrity is examined. RWD either:
	*	Operates as trust (Peter's allegations lack context)
	*	Appropriates funds (unjust enrichment from Daniel's platform)
	*	Is abandoned by trust (Daniel has beneficial ownership)
	All scenarios undermine Peter's case and expose potential misconduct by Peter and trustees."
________________________________
Conclusion
Peter's central premise regarding RWD financial allegations cannot stand without addressing fundamental questions about RWD's revenue integrity, trust structure, and payment obligations. The evidence demonstrates:
1.	RWD has no independent revenue capacity (no stock, no assets)
2.	All sales occurred on Daniel's UK entity's platform (RegimA Zone Ltd)
3.	Daniel funded RWD operations continuously (R140K-R280K over 28 months)
4.	RWD never compensated the platform owner or distributor
5.	RWD paid manufacturer but not distributor (inconsistent with RSA model)
6.	Trust structure unclear (operates as trust or appropriates funds?)
Peter's allegations about expenditures are inconsistent and incomplete without addressing revenue integrity.
Recommended Actions:
1.	Demand Peter provide:
*	Proof of RWD's revenue generation capacity
*	Evidence of payments to RegimA Zone Ltd (platform owner)
*	Explanation for distributor non-payment
*	Clarification of RWD's trust structure vs. RSA
2.	Assert Daniel's claims:
*	Unjust enrichment by RWD (R2.94M - R6.88M)
*	Beneficial ownership of RWD (trust abandonment)
*	Platform usage fees owed to RegimA Zone Ltd
3.	Expose Peter's inconsistencies:
*	Questions expenditures but not revenues
*	Ignores trust structure implications
*	Fails to address payment obligations to Daniel's entities
4.	Challenge RSA structure if needed:
*	If RWD not a trust, is RSA's nil income filing tax fraud?
*	Demand consistency in trust structure treatment
________________________________
Status: Critical Priority - Directly undermines Peter's central financial allegations
Impact: Shifts burden of proof to Peter; exposes revenue integrity gaps; strengthens Daniel's ownership claims
Next Steps: Integrate into responses to PARA 7.2-7.5, 7.6-7.11, and 10.5-10.10.23

I'm going to load the full file directory there and the document you worked on with the required changes and the partly updated version..
The important thing is that the situation is completely different from how it was represented.. 
It's nothing like a family business.. Its about 30-40 companies, many of which are 100% mine for a decade after pete threw us out of the office in 2016.
Now nthey are successfull and he is trying to use the family trust to steal everything and threaten us with forced medical experiments..
So everything needed to be rewritten to represent the actual situation..
All of it will be in that repo as it develops the main processing tree looks something like below so it will be a smaller version of that as it develops:

Ok will send shortly its just taking a long time to make sure there are no speculative claims or potentially defamatory opinions that are not substantiated by material evidence etc.. If we make one arbitrary comment that isn't irrefutable he will use it against us in every case for the next 10 years.. I'll send what I have so far in the next few minutes and we just need to double check it before finalizing.
Also attached is a character reference our formulation chemist gave me 🙂
Will send soon.
Warm Regards
Dan

By the way I forgot to ask last week. Do you know what the correct procedure is for this:
"I hereby irrevocably renounce ALL rights as beneficiary of the Faucitt Family Trust effective immediately. I want nothing from this trust. Any attempts to use trust mechanisms to control me are therefore legally void."
These trustees must be in debt or something.. these people are nuts..
Warm Regards
Dan

Thank you, 
What we require is a detailed note explaining the relevance and importance of the documents.
In the absence of this note, we cannot contextualise the documents. We need this is order to explain the fraud.

	Perhaps the most important discovery is that Danie Bantjies was appointed as a trustee in July last year without my knowledge as detailed in an email from Rynette. He is the accountant for all the companies, commissioner of oaths on all company and trust documents and also a Debtor to Peter and Jacqui with over R18 million in call options becoming due in May 2026.. This is a significant conflict of interests. Given that I informed him (in what I understood to be his capacity as our accountant) in June 2025 of the financial fraud within the companies and furnished him with all the reports after which I requested an urgent forensic audit twice.. He said he was going away for 2 weeks. Iit now explains why he signed a supporting affidavit for Peter as we have been informed that the large transactions exceeding R5 million each was under his instruction whiole acting in his capacity as a trustee making restructuring decisions and reinvesting capital reserves. That is what SARS was actually auditing while the narrative was "IT expenses"..

	Hi Natan
	I'll add the material to the document you prepared now. The main thing I was trying to do is remove speculative claims, unfounded assumptions, potentially defamatory statements of a personal or private nature, medical diagnoses, emotionally charged assertions etc. so that the content remains focused on the evidence related to the business matters in question and behaviour as observed with motivating inference where necessary.
	Warm Regards
	Dan

	Hi Daniel,
	Where is the draft that Doron and I prepared? The document has to be in line with a format that a Court uses as per our draft. I appreciate this document for context, but we need it amplified with your documents as annexures. Please get this done urgently as we are losing valuable time. 
	Kind regards,

	I have restructured many aspects to reference evidence directly rather than speculative claims now we just need Jacqui to review and provide final instructions for which evidence is immediately available and if anything needs correction.
	I will send my response with Shopify & Trust elements ASAP.
	Warm Regards

	Hi Doron
	Indeed I'm just ensuring I send the "hard evidence" as the points made in connection with supporting documents will be distinct from opinion-based assertions. That way we can clearly establish proven fact from disputed claim. I will send through the various parts as and when I can i'm going as fast as I can while still verifying different statements with our records.
	Warm Regards
	Dan & Jax

	Hi Daniel and Jacqui 
	Have you had a chance to prepare the note that natan and I had requested on Friday? When can we expect the note? 
	We need to explain the relevance of the documents to the Court - otherwise we do not have a substantive basis to anticipate / reconsider the ex Arte order.

		Please find attached invoices I have going back to June 2023 as proof that the company RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd owned by Faucitt Family Trust is entirely dependent on the Shopify platform paid for by independent UK company RegimA Zone Ltd owned 100% by Daniel Faucitt and funded entirely by Daniel Faucitt.
		Thus the sole source of revenue for all income to the trust owned entity is dependent on the Shopify platform owned by Daniel Faucitt's company. Without this it would have zero revenue since 2023.
		This is relevant to why it appears that Trustees hijacked their own revenue stream, extracted PII in violation of ZA POPIA and UK GDPR and instructed customers to use a new email address and "order direct" from now on. This is because it was never their revenue stream to begin with. The entire operation and all funds flowing through the account were always owned by Daniel Faucitt's UK company RegimA Zone Ltd.
		So the characterization of Daniel being dependent on the company is false. In fact all revenue for all companies was dependent on Daniel Faucitt's infrastructure.
