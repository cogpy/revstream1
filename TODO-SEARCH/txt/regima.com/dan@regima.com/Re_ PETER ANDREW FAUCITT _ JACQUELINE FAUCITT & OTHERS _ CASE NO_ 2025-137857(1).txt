Dear Nate, Doron, Ian
Here is a draft of some of the main points that we need to address. The main issue is that we are denied access by the Applicant so it takes longer to put the necessary supporting evidence together. Peter is attempting to accelerate the whole process to prevent evidence from being seen by the court. Already another interdict has been issued where he already includes a predetermined psychological assessment specified by his own assertions. I have all my personal banking records to refute the claims entirely so we need to submit the evidence proving the claims are false, not follow his speculative delusions down the rabbit hole.
Warm Regards
Dan
