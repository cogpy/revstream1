This Isaac Chesno clause needs correction:
"129. It is further denied that any “fraud” occurred or that the former UK managing director, Isaac Chesno, engaged in any conduct of that nature. Equally, it is denied that our son’s appointment as managing director of the UK operations arose from any alleged wrongdoing. His appointment was based on merit, capability, and his proven ability to stabilise and grow the business."
