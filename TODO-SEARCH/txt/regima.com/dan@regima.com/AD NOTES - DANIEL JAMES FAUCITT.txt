**IN THE HIGH COURT OF SOUTH AFRICA**  
**GAUTENG DIVISION, PRETORIA**
**Case No:** 2025-137857
**In the matter between:**

and
**JACQUELINE FAUCITT** — First Respondent  
**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT** — Second Respondent  
*(and others)*
---
## I, THE UNDERSIGNED
**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT**
do hereby make oath and state that:
---
### 1. INTRODUCTION AND CAPACITY
1.1 I am the Second Respondent in this matter, an adult male, and a South African citizen.
1.2 I am a Beneficiary of the Faucitt Family Trust (IT 3651/2013) and a co-director of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd (2017/087935/07) and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (2011/005722/07), both of which are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust.
1.3 The facts deposed to in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and belief, save where the context indicates otherwise, and are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
1.4 Where I make legal submissions, I do so on the advice of my legal representatives.
---
### 2. PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT
2.1 This affidavit is filed in response to the Applicant's founding affidavit and the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025.
2.2 I oppose the relief sought by the Applicant and seek to have the ex parte order set aside on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements, and abuse of process.
2.3 I address each of the Applicant's allegations in the order they appear in the founding affidavit, following the AD paragraph sequence.
---
### 3. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 1-3.13: PARTIES AND STRUCTURE
#### AD 1 - Director Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty
3.1 The Applicant invokes provisions relating to director liability for breach of fiduciary duty. I built and managed 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually (Annexure **DF1**). The e-commerce operations were highly profitable under my management. The alleged breaches occurred after I cooperated with the Applicant's request to provide comprehensive reports to the accountant on 6 June 2025 (Annexure **DF3**).
#### AD 1.3 - Applicant's Personal Details and Declaration
3.2 The Applicant's personal details are noted. This affidavit was commissioned by Danie Jacobus Bantjies, identified as "our accountant." On 6 June 2025, I provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies regarding Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC, which is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. I unknowingly reported fraud to one of the perpetrators.
#### AD 2 - Company Business Conduct Requirements
3.3 The Applicant alleges reckless or grossly negligent business conduct. The financial performance demonstrates the contrary: RegimA SA operates 25 Shopify stores with R8.5 million turnover, while RegimA Zone operates 26 Shopify stores with R26.4 million turnover. My late partner, Kayla Pretorius, and I built these operations from inception. Kayla was murdered on 13 July 2023. After her death, I continued managing the operations profitably until they were systematically sabotaged.
#### AD 2.4 - Parties to the Application - Introduction
3.4 The Applicant introduces the parties. The corporate structure reveals that certain entities are owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. The trust has three trustees, but the identity of the third trustee was unknown to me as a beneficiary until recently.
#### AD 3 - Court Order for Probation of Directors/Members
3.5 The Applicant seeks probation orders under Section 162 of the Companies Act. On 10 June 2025, four days after I provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies, I requested an independent audit. Mr. Bantjies dismissed my request, stating he was "going on holiday." The Applicant cancelled 15 UK business cards on 7 June 2025, one day after I cooperated with his request.
#### AD 3.2 - Respondents - Wife
3.6 The First Respondent is correctly identified as the Applicant's wife and my mother. On 15 May 2025, she confronted Rynette Farrar regarding a debt of R1,035,000 owed by RegimA Skin Treatments CC to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd since February 2023. These funds were part of Kayla's estate.
#### AD 3.4 - Respondents - Son
3.7 I am correctly identified as the Applicant's son and Second Respondent. On 30 March 2025, Ms. Farrar and the Applicant dumped two years of unallocated expenses from all companies into RegimA Worldwide Distribution and demanded I sign off within 12 hours for SARS VAT and Annual Accounts (Annexure **DF14**). I used the deadline extension (until 6 June) to finalize reports and uncover fraud. On 6 June 2025, I provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies regarding Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC, which demonstrated an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group (Annexure **DF2**, **DF3**).
#### AD 3.4.2 - Third Respondent - RegimA Skin Treatments
3.8 RegimA Skin Treatments CC (B1992/005371/23) owes R1,035,000 to Rezonance (Pty) Ltd, part of Kayla's estate, since February 2023 (Annexure **SF6**). This debt was the subject of the First Respondent's inquiry on 15 May 2025. RegimA Skin Treatments receives stock from Adderory (Pty) Ltd, a company owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure **SF5**).
#### AD 3.6 - Fourth Respondent - Regim A UK
3.9 RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. Kayla and I established this UK company to own and operate the global e-commerce operations. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments totaling R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**, **DF8**). The UK company funded SA operations, not the reverse.
#### AD 3.6.1 - Fifth Respondent - Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC
3.10 Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC (1996/004451/23) is owned by the Faucitt Family Trust. My analysis revealed an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group—an excessive profit extraction mechanism (Annexure **DF2**). This was the fraud I reported to Mr. Bantjies on 6 June 2025. Mr. Bantjies was "running the companies" at the time. On 10 June 2025, Mr. Bantjies dismissed my audit request.
#### AD 3.6.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Villa Via Arcadia
3.11 Property registration confirms trust ownership. The trust has three trustees. The third trustee's identity was not disclosed to me as a beneficiary until recently.
#### AD 3.7 - Sixth Respondent - Strategic Logistics CC
3.12 Strategic Logistics CC (2008/136496/23) experienced a R5.4 million stock adjustment in 2024 (Annexure **SF3**). This represents 46% of annual sales (R5.4M on R11.3M sales) and is 10 times the prior year's adjustment. The stock type matches inventory supplied by Adderory (Pty) Ltd to RegimA Skin Treatments (Annexure **SF5**). In a SARS audit email, Ms. Farrar claimed that Mr. Bantjies instructed her to make the substantial payments related to this transaction (Annexure **SF4**).
#### AD 3.7.2 - Windeed Printout Evidence for Strategic Logistics
3.13 Property registration documents are noted. The R5.4M stock that allegedly "just disappeared" from Strategic Logistics is the same type of stock supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments.
#### AD 3.8 - Seventh Respondent - FirstRand Bank (FNB)
3.14 FNB holds accounts for the companies. On 14 and 15 February 2025, unauthorized transfers of R450,000 each (R900,000 total) were made from RegimA SA's FNB account without my authority as co-director (Annexure **DF9**). The account opened with R997,597.94 and closed at R5,284.08 within one month (Feb-Mar 2025), despite 169 customer deposits totaling R566,598.57 proving active trade (Annexures **DF10**, **DF11**).
#### AD 3.9 - Eighth and Ninth Respondents
3.15 ABSA Bank and CIPC are cited. Revenue diversion for RegimA SA began on 1 March 2025. Revenue diversion for RegimA Worldwide Distribution began with an ABSA bank letter dated 14 April 2025 (Annexure **DF12**).
#### AD 3.11 - Reference to Respondents as Wife and Son
3.16 The Applicant refers to the First Respondent and me as "my wife" and "my son." We are both beneficiaries of the Faucitt Family Trust. The First Respondent is also a co-trustee. As beneficiaries, we have a legitimate interest in ensuring the trust is managed in accordance with the Trust Property Control Act, 57 of 1988, which requires trustees to act with care, diligence, and skill in the interests of beneficiaries.
#### AD 3.13 - Court Jurisdiction and Identity Confirmation
3.17 Jurisdiction is confirmed. The affidavit was commissioned by Mr. Bantjies, who signed as "Commissioner of Oaths." Mr. Bantjies's accounting firm is "Bantjes and Company." Mr. Bantjies is also the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust—a status that was unknown to me as a beneficiary. Mr. Bantjies is also a debtor to the trust, owing R18.685 million on an investment payout schedule (Annexure **SF1**).
---
### 4. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPH 4: ACCOUNTANT DETAILS - BANTJIES CONFLICT OF INTEREST
#### AD 4 - Accountant Details - Bantjes and Company
4.1 The Applicant identifies "our accountant" as Mr. Bantjies, who attended the office in mid-June 2025. The Applicant omits the following material facts:
4.1.1 Mr. Bantjies is the third trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust—a status unknown to me as a beneficiary until recently.
4.1.2 Mr. Bantjies is a debtor to the trust, owing R18.685 million on an investment payout schedule with payments due in May 2026, May 2027, and May 2029 (Annexure **SF1**).
4.1.3 Mr. Bantjies was "running the companies" when I reported Villa Via fraud to him on 6 June 2025.
4.1.4 Mr. Bantjies dismissed my audit request on 10 June 2025, stating he was "going on holiday."
4.1.5 Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed her to make multi-million rand payments, including the R5.4M stock adjustment payments (SARS audit email, Annexure **SF4**).
4.2 This creates an impermissible conflict of interest: Trustee + Debtor + Accountant + Company Controller + Commissioner of Oaths for this affidavit. Mr. Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery of the fraud I reported.
---
### 5. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 6.1-6.5: CORPORATE STRUCTURE
#### AD 6.1 - Relationships Between Parties
5.1 The Applicant describes family and corporate relationships. The actual control structure reveals: Ms. Farrar controlled all bank accounts, the Sage accounting system (using the Applicant's email pete@regima.com), and claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions rather than the Applicant's (Annexures **SF2**, **SF4**). The Applicant had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems.
#### AD 6.3 - Directors and Members of Respondent Entities
5.2 The Applicant describes directorships. The First Respondent and I are co-directors of RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd. On 14 and 15 February 2025, R900,000 was transferred from RegimA SA without my authority as co-director (Annexure **DF9**). On 30 March 2025, two years of unallocated expenses were dumped into RegimA Worldwide Distribution with a 12-hour deadline for sign-off (Annexure **DF14**).
#### AD 6.5 - Banking and Registration of Respondent Entities
5.3 The Applicant describes banking arrangements. The systematic revenue diversion included: (1) RegimA SA: diversion started 1 March 2025; (2) RegimA Worldwide Distribution: ABSA bank letter 14 April 2025; (3) Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025 (100% audit data loss); (4) Card cancellation 7 June 2025 (rendering documentation inaccessible); (5) Account emptying 11 September 2025 (R1.73M transferred) (Annexure **DF12**).
---
### 6. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 7-7.20: URGENCY AND ALLEGED MISCONDUCT
#### AD 7 - Urgency and Delay Considerations
6.1 The Applicant claims urgency. The timeline reveals: (1) Alleged discovery mid-June 2025; (2) Application filed August 2025; (3) Two-month delay contradicts urgency. The actual urgency relates to my fraud exposure on 6 June 2025 and the First Respondent's debt inquiry on 15 May 2025.
#### AD 7.3 - Urgency Details
6.2 The Applicant claims the accountant noted "numerous discrepancies" in mid-June 2025. Timeline analysis reveals: (1) 6 June 2025: I provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies; (2) 7 June 2025: Applicant cancelled 15 UK business cards without notice (Annexure **DF4**); (3) 10 June 2025: Mr. Bantjies dismissed my audit request. The card cancellation occurred one day after my cooperation, not "following" any discovery. This demonstrates that the Applicant created the problem he now complains about (*venire contra factum proprium*).
#### AD 7.6 - Financial Impact of Misconduct
6.3 The Applicant alleges financial impact. The actual financial sabotage included: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025); (2) Revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025; (3) Shopify data expunged 22 May 2025 (seven days after First Respondent's confrontation); (4) Domain theft 29 May 2025 (regimaskin.co.za registered by Adderory, 14 days after First Respondent's confrontation, Annexure **JF4**); (5) Card cancellation 7 June 2025 (one day after my cooperation); (6) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 (Annexure **DF13**).
#### AD 7.8 - Continuing Harm to Corporations
6.4 The Applicant claims continuing harm. The harm was systematically inflicted over six months (Feb-Sep 2025): (1) Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (4) May: Data expunged, domain stolen; (5) Jun: Cards cancelled, audit dismissed; (6) Jul: Warehouse sabotaged; (7) Sep: Accounts emptied. Each action occurred after either the First Respondent's debt inquiry (15 May) or my fraud exposure (6 June).
#### AD 7.10 - Card Cancellations and Service Interruptions
6.5 The Applicant claims he cancelled cards in June 2025 "following" the accountant's discovery. Timeline evidence demonstrates: (1) 6 June: I provided comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies; (2) 7 June: Applicant cancelled UK cards (5191, 5225) paying for Shopify subscriptions (Annexure **DF4**); (3) Cards cancelled one day after my cooperation, not after any discovery. The cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible through card-based authentication, then the Applicant complained about missing documentation.
#### AD 7.13 - Domain and Service Halts Due to Card Cancellations
6.6 The Applicant claims subscriptions were halted due to card cancellations. To prevent business collapse, I substituted my personal card (1927) for RegimA SA and the First Respondent substituted her personal card (3212) for RegimA Zone (Annexure **JF7**). Meanwhile, the competing domain regimaskin.co.za (owned by Adderory, Ms. Farrar's son's company) was actively diverting customers (Annexure **JF4**).
#### AD 7.16 - Son's Interference with Business Operations
6.7 The Applicant alleges I interfered with operations. The evidence demonstrates I built and managed 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually (Annexure **DF1**). Kayla and I co-built these operations from inception. After Kayla's murder on 13 July 2023, a court order was obtained to seize her email account (kayp@rzo.io), which interfered with a law enforcement investigation that had instructed a freeze on the account (Annexure **SF7**).
#### AD 7.18 - Email and Account Access Interference
6.8 The Applicant claims I restricted email access. The evidence demonstrates: (1) The Applicant had no access to his own email (pete@regima.com)—controlled by Ms. Farrar; (2) Sage screenshots from June and August 2025 show Ms. Farrar using the Applicant's email (Annexure **SF2**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's (Annexure **SF4**); (4) Kayla's email was seized by court order after her murder, interfering with law enforcement investigation (Annexure **SF7**).
#### AD 7.20 - Continued Interference Not in Corporate Interests
6.9 The Applicant claims interference is not in corporate interests. The corporate interests were served by my profitable operations (R34.9M annually). The interference came from: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data expungement; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Domain theft; (6) Warehouse sabotage; (7) Account emptying. Despite six months of systematic sabotage, I was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied on 11 September 2025.
---
### 7. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 8.4-9.3: FINANCIAL DISCREPANCIES AND MISCONDUCT
#### AD 8.4 - Discovery of Financial Discrepancies
7.1 The Applicant claims the accountant discovered discrepancies. Mr. Bantjies is: (1) Undisclosed trustee; (2) Debtor owing R18.685M; (3) Controller of financial systems; (4) Recipient of my fraud report on 6 June 2025. Mr. Bantjies dismissed my audit request on 10 June 2025. The "discovery" occurred after I exposed fraud to the person facilitating it.
#### AD 8.5 - Accountant's Attendance and Findings
7.2 The Applicant states Mr. Bantjies attended for provisional tax and VAT submissions. The two years of unallocated expenses (dumped into RegimA Worldwide Distribution on 30 March 2025) occurred while: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled the accounting system using the Applicant's email; (2) Linda (Ms. Farrar's sister) was employed as bookkeeper (Annexure **SF8**); (3) Mr. Bantjies was the accountant and trustee. The question arises: why were expenses unallocated for two years if the accountant, trustee, and bookkeeper were performing their duties?
#### AD 8.7 - IT Expenses and Tax Problems
7.3 The Applicant cites IT expenses: 2024 tax year R6,738,007.47; 2025 tax year R2,116,159.47. The Applicant claims these are "almost entirely unexplainable." The context omitted from the founding affidavit is that these expenses supported 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually (Annexure **DF1**). The IT expenses represent 19.3% of revenue (2024) and 6.1% of revenue (2025)—reasonable for a global e-commerce operation with 51+ stores across multiple jurisdictions. The Applicant fails to disclose the revenue context, creating a false impression of unexplained expenses.
#### AD 8.10 - International Expenses and Tax Implications
7.4 The Applicant claims expenses are "seemingly international" and accounts have "almost exceeded the yearly allowable quota for funds leaving South Africa." The Shopify platforms were funded by UK company RegimA Zone Ltd (company 10697009). UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). Shopify invoices demonstrate UK → SA payment flow of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). The international expenses were legitimate costs of UK-owned e-commerce operations, and the payment direction was UK → SA, not SA → UK.
#### AD 9.2 - Bank Message Regarding International Transfers
7.5 The Applicant references bank messages about international transfers. The actual international payment flow is demonstrated by Shopify invoices: UK entities (RegimA Zone Ltd) funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). UK bank transactions corroborate the invoices (Annexure **DF8**). The payment direction is UK → SA, not SA → UK as the Applicant's affidavit implies. The Applicant's statement is demonstrably false.
#### AD 9.3 - Financial Misconduct Summary
7.6 The Applicant summarizes alleged misconduct. The documented financial misconduct includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) without my authority as co-director; (2) R5.4 million stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics—same stock type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments (Annexures **SF3**, **SF5**); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments for this stock (SARS audit email, Annexure **SF4**); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023, unpaid despite Ms. Farrar's false claim to the First Respondent that it was paid (Annexures **JF2**, **SF6**).
---
### 8. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 10.1-10.14: APPLICATION TO DECLARE RESPONDENTS DELINQUENT
#### AD 10.1 - Relief Sought - Delinquency or Probation
8.1 The Applicant seeks delinquency or probation orders under Section 162. The evidence establishes grounds for the Applicant's own delinquency: (1) Unauthorized R900K transfers in breach of fiduciary duty as co-director; (2) Card cancellation sabotage one day after my cooperation; (3) False statements about UK payment flows (perjury); (4) Abuse of ex parte process through material non-disclosures; (5) Systematic sabotage of profitable businesses (R34.9M operations destroyed).
#### AD 10.3 - Delinquent Conduct of Respondents
8.2 The Applicant alleges delinquent conduct by the First Respondent and me. My actual conduct included: (1) Building and managing R34.9M profitable operations with Kayla; (2) Cooperating with the Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025; (3) Exposing Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (4) Requesting independent audit on 10 June 2025; (5) Substituting personal card to prevent business collapse after Applicant's card cancellation; (6) Continuing to pay creditors despite six months of systematic sabotage.
#### AD 10.4 - Contravention of Companies Act
8.3 The Applicant alleges Companies Act contraventions. Section 76(3)(b) requires directors to act in good faith and for a proper purpose. The Applicant's actions demonstrate bad faith: (1) Manufactured crisis (card cancellation day after my cooperation); (2) Material non-disclosures in ex parte application (Mr. Bantjies's trustee status, debtor status, timeline, UK payment flow); (3) False statements about UK operations (perjury); (4) Systematic sabotage of profitable businesses I built.
#### AD 10.5.2 - Probation Relief Under Section 162
8.4 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162. This section requires consideration of conflicts of interest. The evidence reveals: Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant + Company Controller) commissioned this affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths. Mr. Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery of the fraud I reported on 6 June 2025.
#### AD 10.6 - Close Corporations Act - Fiduciary Duties
8.5 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act fiduciary duties. The Act requires members to manage in the corporation's interest. RegimA Skin Treatments (CC) owes R1,035,000 to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023. Strategic Logistics (CC) lost R5.4M in stock that "disappeared"—same stock type supplied by Adderory. Villa Via (CC) charged 86% profit margin rent to the group. These transactions were not in the corporations' interests.
#### AD 10.6.1 - Member's Duty to Manage in Corporation's Interest
8.6 The Applicant cites duty to manage in corporation's interest. The R5.4M stock adjustment in Strategic Logistics represents 46% of annual sales—10 times the historical adjustment (Annexure **SF3**). Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments (Annexure **SF4**). This transaction was not in Strategic Logistics' interest. The transaction appears to be transfer pricing manipulation: stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics and appeared in RegimA Skin Treatments, supplied by Adderory (Ms. Farrar's son's company).
#### AD 10.6.2 - Member's Duty Not to Exceed Powers
8.7 The Applicant cites duty not to exceed powers. The unauthorized R900,000 transfers from RegimA SA (14-15 Feb 2025) were made without my authority as co-director (Annexure **DF9**). The Applicant exceeded his powers by acting unilaterally. RegimA SA account: opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 within one month, despite 169 customer deposits R566,598.57 proving active trade (Annexures **DF10**, **DF11**).
#### AD 10.6.3 - Member's Duty to Avoid Conflicts of Interest
8.8 The Applicant cites duty to avoid conflicts. The evidence reveals multiple conflicts: (1) Mr. Bantjies: Trustee + Debtor (R18.685M) + Accountant + Company Controller + Commissioner of Oaths; (2) Ms. Farrar's son (Adderory) supplying stock to RegimA Skin Treatments while same stock type "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics; (3) Villa Via (trust-owned) charging 86% profit margin rent to group; (4) Regimaskin.co.za (owned by Ms. Farrar's son) competing with operations I built; (5) Ms. Farrar controlling systems while claiming to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions.
#### AD 10.7 - Member Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty
8.9 The Applicant invokes breach of fiduciary duty liability. The breaches are established: (1) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to me (co-director) by unauthorized R900K transfers; (2) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to me (beneficiary) by attacking me with interdict after I exposed fraud; (3) Mr. Bantjies breached fiduciary duty to me (beneficiary) by dismissing my audit request and facilitating fraud; (4) The Applicant breached fiduciary duty to corporations by systematic sabotage of profitable operations.
#### AD 10.7.1.2 - Liability for Economic Benefit Derived
8.10 The Applicant cites liability for economic benefit. The economic benefits derived include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers; (2) R5.4M stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics (transfer pricing to Adderory → RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (4) 86% profit margin on Villa Via rent (R34.9M operations forced to pay excessive rent); (5) Customer diversion to regimaskin.co.za (Adderory).
#### AD 10.7.1.4 - Liability for Loss Suffered by Corporation
8.11 The Applicant cites liability for corporate loss. The losses suffered include: (1) RegimA SA: R900K unauthorized transfers, revenue diversion starting 1 Mar 2025, account depleted from R997,597.94 to R5,284.08; (2) RegimA Zone: Customer diversion to competing domain, card cancellation sabotage, R26.4M operations destroyed; (3) Strategic Logistics: R5.4M stock "disappeared"; (4) RegimA Worldwide: Forced to pay 2 years of unallocated expenses from all companies, R8.5M operations destroyed; (5) All companies: Shopify data expunged (100% audit data loss), warehouse sabotaged, accounts emptied R1.73M (11 Sep 2025).
#### AD 10.8 - Disqualification for Misconduct Under Section 47
8.12 The Applicant invokes Close Corporations Act Section 47 disqualification. This section applies when a member is guilty of gross negligence or fraud. The R5.4M stock adjustment (46% of sales, 10x historical) in Strategic Logistics, with Ms. Farrar claiming Mr. Bantjies instructed the payments, and the same stock type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments, suggests systematic fraud through transfer pricing manipulation.
#### AD 10.8.1 - Declaration of Delinquency as Alternative Relief
8.13 The Applicant seeks delinquency declaration. The evidence supports declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5): (1) Intentional harm to companies (systematic sabotage destroying R34.9M operations); (2) Grossly negligent conduct (card cancellation without notice rendering documentation inaccessible); (3) Breach of trust (trustee attacking beneficiaries); (4) Abuse of process (ex parte order based on material non-disclosures and false statements); (5) Perjury (false statements about UK payment flows).
#### AD 10.9 - Mandatory Disqualification Under Section 162(5)
8.14 The Applicant invokes Section 162(5) mandatory disqualification grounds. These grounds apply to the Applicant's conduct: (1) Intentional harm to companies (R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage, revenue diversions, data expungement, card cancellation, account emptying); (2) Grossly negligent harm (card cancellation rendering documentation inaccessible, then complaining about missing documentation); (3) Breach of trust (trustee attacking beneficiaries who exposed fraud).
#### AD 10.9.2 - Intentional or Grossly Negligent Harm
8.15 The Applicant alleges intentional or grossly negligent harm by respondents. The intentional harm was inflicted by the Applicant and his co-conspirators over six months: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping (12-hour deadline); (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 15 May: First Respondent's debt inquiry; (6) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days later); (7) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days later); (8) 6 Jun: My fraud exposure; (9) 7 Jun: Cards cancelled (1 day later); (10) 10 Jun: Audit dismissed; (11) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotaged; (12) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied.
#### AD 10.9.3 - Manner of Acting - Gross Negligence or Misconduct
8.16 The Applicant alleges gross negligence or misconduct. The gross negligence is demonstrated by: Cancelling 15 business cards without notice, rendering documentation inaccessible through card-based authentication, then complaining about missing documentation. This demonstrates consciousness of guilt and bad faith. The Applicant created the problem he now complains about (*venire contra factum proprium*).
#### AD 10.9.3.1 - Gross Negligence or Wilful Misconduct
8.17 The Applicant alleges wilful misconduct. The wilful misconduct includes: (1) Systematic revenue diversion (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (2) Data destruction (22 May, 100% audit data loss); (3) Domain theft (29 May, diverting customers to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son); (4) Card sabotage (7 Jun, day after my cooperation); (5) Audit dismissal (10 Jun, by Mr. Bantjies); (6) Warehouse sabotage (8 Jul, destroying R34.9M operations); (7) Account emptying (11 Sep, R1.73M transferred). This six-month campaign occurred after the First Respondent investigated fraud (15 May) and I exposed fraud (6 Jun).
#### AD 10.9.3.2 - Acquiescence to Fraudulent Acts
8.18 The Applicant alleges acquiescence to fraud. The acquiescence to fraud includes: (1) Two years of unallocated expenses while Ms. Farrar controlled systems using the Applicant's email, Linda was employed as bookkeeper, and Mr. Bantjies was accountant and trustee; (2) R5.4M stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics with Mr. Bantjies allegedly instructing payments, same stock type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments; (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate unpaid since Feb 2023, Ms. Farrar falsely claimed paid; (4) Villa Via 86% profit margin rent extraction from operations I built.
#### AD 10.9.3.3 - Party to Omission with Fraudulent Purpose
8.19 The Applicant alleges omission with fraudulent purpose. The omissions with fraudulent purpose include: (1) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's trustee status from affidavit; (2) Applicant omitted Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt to trust; (3) Applicant omitted R34.9M revenue context for IT expenses; (4) Applicant omitted UK → SA payment flow (claimed opposite, perjury); (5) Applicant omitted timeline showing card cancellation day after my cooperation; (6) Applicant omitted First Respondent's debt inquiry and subsequent retaliation; (7) Applicant omitted my fraud exposure and subsequent sabotage campaign.
#### AD 10.10 - Probation Under Section 162(7)
8.20 The Applicant seeks probation under Section 162(7). This section applies when conduct is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial. The oppressive conduct includes: (1) I built R34.9M profitable operations with Kayla, then was systematically sabotaged after exposing fraud; (2) I cooperated with Applicant's request on 6 June, then suffered card cancellation on 7 June; (3) I requested audit on 10 June, then Mr. Bantjies dismissed it; (4) I substituted personal card to prevent business collapse, then was attacked with interdict; (5) I was excluded from profitable businesses I built with murdered partner.
#### AD 10.10.2.3 - Oppressive or Prejudicial Exercise of Powers
8.21 The Applicant alleges oppressive exercise of powers. The oppressive exercise of powers includes: (1) Applicant used trustee powers to attack beneficiaries who exposed fraud; (2) Mr. Bantjies used trustee powers to dismiss audit request and facilitate fraud; (3) Applicant used director powers to make unauthorized R900K transfers without my authority as co-director; (4) Applicant used court process to obtain ex parte order based on material non-disclosures and false statements (perjury).
#### AD 10.10.2.4 - Conduct with Oppressive or Prejudicial Result
8.22 The Applicant alleges conduct with prejudicial result. The prejudicial results include: (1) I was excluded from R34.9M operations I built with murdered partner Kayla; (2) Customers diverted to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Adderory); (3) R900K transferred without my authorization as co-director; (4) R5.4M stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics (transfer pricing to Adderory); (5) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate unpaid; (6) Audit data expunged (100% loss); (7) Documentation rendered inaccessible; (8) Warehouse sabotaged; (9) Accounts emptied.

The oppressive conduct includes: (1) Ms. Farrar controlled all systems using Applicant's email while claiming to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions; (2) Applicant had no access to email, bank accounts, or accounting systems; (3) Two years of expenses unallocated despite employed bookkeeper (Linda, Ms. Farrar's sister) and accountant/trustee (Mr. Bantjies); (4) Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor R18.685M + Accountant) dismissed my fraud investigation and audit request.
#### AD 10.10.41 - Conduct Inconsistent with Duties
8.24 The Applicant alleges conduct inconsistent with duties. The conduct inconsistent with duties includes: (1) Trustee attacking beneficiaries who exposed fraud (Applicant, Mr. Bantjies); (2) Director making unauthorized transfers without co-director's authority (Applicant); (3) Trustee dismissing beneficiary's fraud investigation and audit request (Mr. Bantjies); (4) Accountant/Trustee facilitating fraud while being debtor R18.685M (Mr. Bantjies); (5) Administrator controlling systems while diverting revenue and facilitating son's competing domain (Ms. Farrar).
#### AD 10.13 - Unaccounted Money - Significant Sums
8.25 The Applicant alleges unaccounted money. The unaccounted money includes: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb 2025) without my authority; (2) R5.4 million stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics (same type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023; (4) R1.73 million transferred 11 Sep 2025; (5) Two years of unallocated expenses dumped into RegimA Worldwide on 30 Mar 2025.

### 9. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 11.2-12.4: UK OPERATIONS AND ALLEGED FRAUD
#### AD 11.2 - UK Head Office - RegimA UK Ltd
9.1 The Applicant describes UK operations. RegimA Zone Ltd (UK company 10697009) owns and funds the Shopify platforms. Kayla and I established this UK company to own and operate the global e-commerce operations. UK bank transactions demonstrate continuous Shopify payments (Annexure **DF8**). The UK company is the economic owner of the e-commerce operations generating R34.9M annually.
#### AD 11.3 - Directors of UK Entity
9.2 The Applicant describes UK directors. Kayla and I established the UK company to own and operate the global e-commerce platforms. After Kayla's murder on 13 July 2023, I continued managing the operations profitably until they were systematically sabotaged (Feb-Sep 2025).
#### AD 11.4 - Applicant's Role in Operations
9.3 The Applicant describes his role. The evidence demonstrates the Applicant had no operational role: (1) No access to email (pete@regima.com controlled by Ms. Farrar, Annexure **SF2**); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar using Applicant's email); (4) Ms. Farrar claimed to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions, not the Applicant's (Annexure **SF4**). The Applicant appears to be a figurehead while Mr. Bantjies (Trustee + Debtor + Accountant) had ultimate control.
#### AD 11.6 - UK Branch Operations
9.4 The Applicant describes UK branch operations. The UK company funded SA operations through Shopify subscription payments. Shopify invoices demonstrate UK → SA payment flow of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). UK bank transactions corroborate the invoices (Annexure **DF8**). The UK company invested in SA operations, not the reverse. The Applicant's claim that UK owes SA is demonstrably false (perjury).
#### AD 11.8 - UK Financial Concerns
9.5 The Applicant expresses UK financial concerns. The financial concerns were manufactured through systematic sabotage: (1) Card cancellation 7 June 2025 disrupted UK funding (Annexure **DF4**); (2) Domain theft 29 May 2025 diverted customers to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son (Annexure **JF4**); (3) Warehouse sabotage 8 July 2025 destroyed UK-funded operations (Annexure **DF13**); (4) Data expungement 22 May 2025 eliminated audit trail (100% loss).
#### AD 12.1 - UK Branch Non-Payment and Fraud Concerns
9.6 The Applicant alleges UK branch non-payment and fraud. The Shopify invoices prove the opposite: UK entities funded SA operations to the tune of R84,661+ annually (Annexures **DF5**, **DF6**, **DF7**). UK bank transactions corroborate the invoices (Annexure **DF8**). The payment direction is UK → SA, not SA → UK. The Applicant's statement is demonstrably false (perjury). This material misrepresentation was included in the ex parte application to mislead the Court.
#### AD 12.2 - Misappropriation Leading to Insolvency Risk
9.7 The Applicant alleges misappropriation leading to insolvency. The actual insolvency risk was created by the Applicant's six-month sabotage campaign: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers (14-15 Feb); (2) Revenue diversions (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (3) Data expungement (22 May); (4) Domain theft (29 May); (5) Card cancellation (7 Jun); (6) Warehouse sabotage (8 Jul); (7) Account emptying (11 Sep, R1.73M). Despite six months of systematic sabotage, I was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied on 11 September 2025.
#### AD 12.3 - Purpose of Court Application
9.8 The Applicant states the purpose is to prevent further harm. The actual purpose appears to be: (1) Punish First Respondent for investigating R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate (15 May); (2) Punish me for exposing Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (6 June); (3) Seize control of R34.9M operations I built with murdered partner Kayla; (4) Prevent forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor R18.685M + Accountant) and the systematic fraud (R5.4M stock transfer pricing, R1,035,000 debt, two years unallocated expenses).
#### AD 12.4 - Alternative Roles for Wife and Son
9.9 The Applicant suggests alternative roles for the First Respondent and me. The evidence demonstrates: (1) First Respondent fulfilled trustee duties by investigating fraud (R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate); (2) I built and managed R34.9M profitable operations with murdered partner Kayla; (3) I cooperated with Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025; (4) I exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator); (5) Both of us were systematically sabotaged after investigating/exposing fraud; (6) Both of us were attacked with interdict by co-trustees.
---
### 10. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 13.2-13.8: REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERDICTORY RELIEF
#### AD 13.2 - Clear Right Not to Be Prejudiced
10.1 The Applicant claims clear right not to be prejudiced. The Applicant has no clear right: (1) He manufactured the crisis (card cancellation day after my cooperation, *venire contra factum proprium*); (2) He made unauthorized R900K transfers without my authority as co-director; (3) He had alternative remedies as trustee with "additional powers" as Founder; (4) He obtained order through material non-disclosures (Mr. Bantjies's trustee status, debtor status, timeline manipulation, UK payment flow misrepresentation/perjury, revenue context omission).
#### AD 13.2.2 - Injury Sustained and Apprehension of Further Harm
10.2 The Applicant claims injury and apprehension of harm. The Applicant suffered no injury he didn't inflict on himself: (1) Card cancellation rendered documentation inaccessible; (2) Unauthorized transfers depleted accounts; (3) Revenue diversions reduced cash flow; (4) Warehouse sabotage destroyed operations; (5) Data expungement eliminated audit trail. The apprehension of further harm was manufactured to justify ex parte relief. The actual harm was suffered by me: R34.9M operations I built with murdered partner Kayla were systematically destroyed.
#### AD 13.3 - Reasonable Apprehension of Irreparable Harm
10.3 The Applicant claims reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm. The irreparable harm was inflicted by the Applicant's six-month sabotage campaign: (1) R34.9M operations destroyed (93.3% revenue collapse from R34.9M to R2.3M); (2) Customer relationships diverted to competing domain owned by Ms. Farrar's son; (3) Audit data expunged (100% loss); (4) Documentation rendered inaccessible through card-based authentication; (5) Accounts emptied (R1.73M transferred 11 Sep). The First Respondent and I suffered irreparable harm, not the Applicant.
#### AD 13.4 - Interdicts Essential for Corporation Survival
10.4 The Applicant claims interdicts essential for survival. The corporations were highly profitable under my management (R34.9M annually). The survival threat came from the Applicant's sabotage: (1) Unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions; (3) Data destruction; (4) Card cancellations; (5) Domain theft; (6) Warehouse sabotage; (7) Account emptying. Excluding the First Respondent and me threatened survival, not ensured it. I was still managing to pay creditors despite six months of sabotage until the accounts were emptied.
#### AD 13.5 - Balance of Convenience Favours Granting Relief
10.5 The Applicant claims balance of convenience favors relief. The balance overwhelmingly favors the First Respondent and me: (1) I built and managed R34.9M profitable operations with murdered partner Kayla; (2) I cooperated with Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports; (3) I exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies; (4) I requested independent audit; (5) I substituted personal card to prevent business collapse; (6) I continued paying creditors despite six months of sabotage; (7) I support independent forensic audit. The Applicant obtained relief through material non-disclosures and false statements (perjury).
#### AD 13.8 - Other Relief Sought in Part A
10.6 The Applicant seeks additional relief. The relief was obtained ex parte based on material non-disclosures and false statements: (1) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Omitting Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt; (3) Omitting timeline showing card cancellation day after my cooperation; (4) Falsely claiming UK owes SA (opposite is true, perjury); (5) Omitting R34.9M revenue context for IT expenses; (6) Omitting First Respondent's debt inquiry and retaliation pattern; (7) Omitting my fraud exposure and sabotage campaign.
---
### 11. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 14.1-14.5: FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND FORENSIC AUDIT
#### AD 14.1 - Financial Constraints on Respondents
11.1 The Applicant seeks financial constraints on the First Respondent and me. The financial constraints were already imposed through six months of systematic sabotage: (1) R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) Revenue diversions (1 Mar, 14 Apr); (3) Data expungement (22 May); (4) Domain theft (29 May); (5) Card cancellations (7 Jun); (6) Warehouse sabotage (8 Jul); (7) Account emptying (11 Sep, R1.73M). Despite this sabotage, I was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied.
#### AD 14.3 - Constraint to Prevent Financial Prejudice
11.2 The Applicant seeks constraints to prevent prejudice. The prejudice was inflicted by the Applicant: (1) RegimA SA account opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 within one month (Feb-Mar 2025); (2) 169 customer deposits R566,598.57 proving active trade; (3) R1.73M transferred 11 Sep 2025; (4) R34.9M operations destroyed by warehouse sabotage (93.3% revenue collapse).
#### AD 14.4 - Forensic Audit Necessity and Remuneration
11.3 The Applicant seeks forensic audit. I support independent forensic audit by an impartial party (not Mr. Bantjies or anyone connected to him). Such audit would reveal: (1) Mr. Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor R18.685M + Accountant + Company Controller); (2) R5.4M stock transfer pricing scheme (Strategic Logistics → Adderory → RegimA Skin Treatments); (3) R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate unpaid since Feb 2023; (4) Two years unallocated expenses while Ms. Farrar controlled systems, Linda was employed as bookkeeper, and Mr. Bantjies was accountant/trustee; (5) Unauthorized R900K transfers without my authority; (6) Revenue diversion scheme (1 Mar, 14 Apr, 11 Sep); (7) Ms. Farrar's control of systems using Applicant's email and Adderory's role.
#### AD 14.5 - Request for Relief Under Part B
11.4 The Applicant requests Part B relief. The relief should include: (1) Setting aside ex parte order obtained through material non-disclosures and false statements (perjury); (2) Independent forensic audit by impartial auditor (not Mr. Bantjies); (3) Investigation of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor R18.685M + Accountant); (4) Investigation of R5.4M stock "disappearance" and transfer pricing scheme; (5) Recovery of R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate; (6) Investigation of Ms. Farrar's control and Adderory's role; (7) Consideration of Applicant's delinquency under Section 162(5) for systematic sabotage, perjury, and abuse of process.
---
### 12. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 16.1-16.12: DISCOVERY AND URGENCY
#### AD 16.1 - Discovery of Respondents' Conduct
12.1 The Applicant claims discovery of conduct in mid-June 2025. The actual discovery timeline: (1) 15 May: First Respondent discovered R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate, confronted Ms. Farrar; (2) 6 June: I exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies; (3) 7 June: Applicant cancelled cards (day after my cooperation); (4) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed my audit request. The Applicant's "discovery" was actually consciousness of guilt after I exposed fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator).
#### AD 16.2 - R600,000 Transfer as Trigger for Action
12.2 The Applicant cites R600,000 transfer (later corrected to R500,000) as trigger. The actual triggers were: (1) 15 May: First Respondent confronted Ms. Farrar about R1,035,000 debt and "profiting from proceeds of murder"; (2) 6 June: I exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator who owed R18.685M to trust); (3) 10 June: Mr. Bantjies dismissed my audit request. The R500,000 transfer is a pretext. The real trigger was my fraud exposure threatening Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt concealment.
#### AD 16.5 - Unawareness of Urgent Application Process
12.3 The Applicant claims unawareness of urgent process. The Applicant had access to legal advice and Mr. Bantjies as Commissioner of Oaths. The delay from mid-June to August (two months) contradicts urgency. The actual urgency appears to be preventing forensic audit that would expose Mr. Bantjies's conflicts (Trustee + Debtor R18.685M + Accountant) and systematic fraud (R5.4M stock transfer pricing, R1,035,000 debt, two years unallocated expenses).
#### AD 16.6 - Delay Would Have Been Avoided
12.4 The Applicant claims delay would have been avoided if he knew the process. The two-month delay (mid-June to August) contradicts urgency. The timing suggests: (1) Waiting to see if my audit request would proceed; (2) Coordinating with Mr. Bantjies (who dismissed audit request 10 June); (3) Preparing First Respondent's punishment (included in interdict 13 Aug, two days after signing "Main Trustee" document 11 Aug); (4) Executing final sabotage (warehouse 8 Jul, accounts 11 Sep).
#### AD 16.8 - State of Shock and Delayed Response
12.5 The Applicant claims state of shock. The Applicant was not in shock—he was executing a systematic six-month sabotage campaign: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping (12-hour deadline); (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days after First Respondent's inquiry); (6) 29 May: Domain stolen (14 days after First Respondent's inquiry); (7) 7 Jun: Cards cancelled (1 day after my cooperation); (8) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotaged; (9) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied. This is not shock—this is systematic execution coordinated with Mr. Bantjies.
#### AD 16.10 - Attorney Consultation Timeline
12.6 The Applicant describes attorney consultation. The consultation occurred after: (1) First Respondent's debt inquiry (15 May); (2) Data expungement (22 May); (3) Domain theft (29 May); (4) My fraud exposure (6 June); (5) Card cancellation (7 June); (6) Mr. Bantjies's audit dismissal (10 June). The legal action was retaliation, not discovery. The Applicant and Mr. Bantjies coordinated to attack beneficiaries who exposed fraud.
#### AD 16.12 - Need for Urgent Court Assistance
12.7 The Applicant claims need for urgent assistance. The Applicant had alternative remedies: (1) Trustee with "additional powers" as Founder; (2) Could have conducted audit as trustee; (3) Could have consulted with co-trustee (First Respondent) instead of attacking her; (4) Could have consulted with co-trustee Mr. Bantjies (who was facilitating the fraud and owed R18.685M). The Applicant chose ex parte process to avoid disclosure of Mr. Bantjies's conflicts, systematic sabotage, and false statements about UK operations.
---
### 13. RESPONSE TO AD PARAGRAPHS 17.3-17.4: EX PARTE BASIS
#### AD 17.3 - Ex Parte Basis for Application
13.1 The Applicant justifies ex parte application. The ex parte process was abused through material non-disclosures and false statements: (1) Mr. Bantjies's trustee status; (2) Mr. Bantjies's R18.685M debt to trust; (3) Timeline manipulation (card cancellation day after my cooperation, not "following" discovery); (4) UK payment flow misrepresentation (claimed SA → UK, actually UK → SA, perjury); (5) R34.9M revenue context omission for IT expenses; (6) First Respondent's debt inquiry and retaliation pattern (data expunged 7 days, domain stolen 14 days); (7) My fraud exposure and sabotage campaign (card cancelled 1 day, audit dismissed 4 days); (8) Ms. Farrar's control of Applicant's email (pete@regima.com); (9) Adderory's competing domain (regimaskin.co.za); (10) R5.4M stock "disappearance" and transfer pricing scheme.
#### AD 17.4 - Urgency Justifies Ex Parte Relief
13.2 The Applicant claims urgency justifies ex parte relief. The urgency was manufactured: (1) Two-month delay (mid-June to August) contradicts urgency; (2) Card cancellation day after my cooperation shows consciousness of guilt; (3) Systematic sabotage from Feb-Sep shows premeditation and coordination; (4) First Respondent included two days after signing document shows coordination; (5) Alternative remedies available as trustee with "additional powers." The ex parte relief was obtained to prevent the First Respondent and me from exposing the material non-disclosures, false statements (perjury), and systematic fraud.
---
### 14. RESPONSE TO REMAINING AD PARAGRAPHS (18.3, 20, 22, 40.9.4, 44, 50, 74, 78, 83, 88)
#### AD 18.3 - Continual Unauthorized Fund Transfers
14.1 The Applicant alleges continual unauthorized transfers. The unauthorized transfers were made by the Applicant: R450,000 on 14 Feb 2025 + R450,000 on 15 Feb 2025 = R900,000 total from RegimA SA without my authority as co-director (Annexure **DF9**). RegimA SA account: opened R997,597.94, closed R5,284.08 within one month despite 169 customer deposits R566,598.57 proving active trade (Annexures **DF10**, **DF11**).
#### AD 20 - First and Second Respondent Details
14.2 The Applicant provides the First Respondent's and my details.

#### AD 40.9.4 - Gross Abuse of Director/Member Position
14.4 The Applicant alleges gross abuse of position. The gross abuse includes: (1) Applicant made R900K unauthorized transfers as director without my authority as co-director; (2) Applicant cancelled cards without notice as director, rendering documentation inaccessible; (3) Applicant used trustee position to attack beneficiaries who exposed fraud; (4) Mr. Bantjies used trustee position to dismiss audit and facilitate fraud while owing R18.685M; (5) Ms. Farrar used administrative position to control systems, divert revenue, facilitate son's competing domain, and claim to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions.
#### AD 44 - Applicant Identity Details
14.5 The Applicant confirms identity. The Applicant's actual position: (1) No access to email (pete@regima.com controlled by Ms. Farrar, Annexure **SF2**); (2) No access to bank accounts (controlled by Ms. Farrar); (3) No access to accounting systems (controlled by Ms. Farrar using Applicant's email); (4) Debtor to Mr. Bantjies (R18.685M due May 2026, May 2027, May 2029); (5) Figurehead while Ms. Farrar claims to act under Mr. Bantjies's instructions (Annexure **SF4**).
#### AD 50 - Registered Address Details
14.6 The Applicant provides address: 20 River Road, Morning Hill, Bedfordview. This is also the First Respondent's address. The Applicant attacked the First Respondent (co-trustee, beneficiary, wife) with interdict two days after she signed "Main Trustee" document, punishing her for investigating R1,035,000 debt to Kayla's estate and supporting me.
#### AD 74 - Timeline Context
14.7 The Applicant provides timeline context. The actual timeline demonstrates systematic sabotage coordinated with Mr. Bantjies: (1) 14-15 Feb: R900K unauthorized transfers; (2) 1 Mar: Revenue diversion started; (3) 30 Mar: Expense dumping (12-hour deadline); (4) 14 Apr: Bank letter for revenue diversion; (5) 15 May: First Respondent's debt inquiry; (6) 22 May: Data expunged (7 days later, 100% audit data loss); (7) 29 May: Domain stolen by Adderory (14 days later); (8) 6 Jun: My fraud exposure to Mr. Bantjies; (9) 7 Jun: Cards cancelled (1 day later); (10) 10 Jun: Audit dismissed by Mr. Bantjies (4 days later); (11) 8 Jul: Warehouse sabotaged; (12) 11 Aug: First Respondent signs document; (13) 13 Aug: First Respondent included in interdict (2 days later); (14) 11 Sep: Accounts emptied (R1.73M).
#### AD 78 - Accountant's Office Visit and Discovery
14.8 The Applicant describes Mr. Bantjies's office visit. The visit occurred after: (1) I provided comprehensive reports on 6 June 2025 (Annexure **DF3**); (2) I exposed Villa Via fraud to Mr. Bantjies (unknowingly to perpetrator who owed R18.685M to trust); (3) Applicant cancelled cards on 7 June 2025 (day after my cooperation, Annexure **DF4**). Mr. Bantjies "discovered" irregularities after I reported fraud to him. Mr. Bantjies then dismissed my audit request on 10 June 2025, claiming he was "going on holiday." Mr. Bantjies had R18.685M reasons to prevent discovery.
#### AD 83 - Irregular Payments Discovery
14.9 The Applicant describes discovery of irregular payments. The irregular payments include: (1) R900,000 unauthorized transfers by Applicant (14-15 Feb 2025) without my authority as co-director; (2) R5.4 million stock "disappeared" from Strategic Logistics (same type supplied by Adderory to RegimA Skin Treatments, transfer pricing scheme); (3) Ms. Farrar claimed Mr. Bantjies instructed the substantial payments (SARS audit email, Annexure **SF4**); (4) R1,035,000 owed to Kayla's estate since Feb 2023 (Ms. Farrar falsely claimed paid to First Respondent on 15 May 2025).

### 15. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
15.1 I respectfully request that this Honourable Court:
15.1.1 Set aside the ex parte order granted on 19 August 2025 on the grounds of material non-disclosures, false statements (perjury), and abuse of process.
15.1.2 Dismiss the Applicant's application for delinquency or probation orders against the First Respondent and me.
15.1.3 Grant a counter-application declaring the Applicant delinquent under Section 162(5) of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008, on the grounds of:
- Intentional harm to companies through systematic six-month sabotage campaign (Feb-Sep 2025);
- Grossly negligent conduct in card cancellation without notice rendering documentation inaccessible;
- Breach of fiduciary duty to me as co-director (unauthorized R900K transfers) and as beneficiary (attacking me after fraud exposure);
- Abuse of court process through material non-disclosures and false statements (perjury regarding UK payment flows);
- Systematic destruction of R34.9M profitable operations I built with murdered partner Kayla.
15.1.4 Order an independent forensic audit by an impartial auditor (not Mr. Bantjies or anyone connected to him) to investigate:
- Mr. Bantjies's conflicts of interest (Trustee + Debtor R18.685M + Accountant + Company Controller);
- R5.4 million stock transfer pricing scheme (Strategic Logistics → Adderory → RegimA Skin Treatments);
- R1,035,000 debt to Kayla Pretorius's estate unpaid since Feb 2023;
- Two years of unallocated expenses while Ms. Farrar controlled systems, Linda was employed as bookkeeper, and Mr. Bantjies was accountant/trustee;
- Unauthorized R900,000 transfers without my authority as co-director;
- Revenue diversion scheme (1 Mar, 14 Apr, 11 Sep 2025);
- Ms. Farrar's control of systems using Applicant's email and Adderory's role in competing domain and stock supply;
- Court order seizing Kayla's email during law enforcement investigation.
15.1.5 Order the Applicant to pay the costs of this application on the scale as between attorney and client.
15.1.6 Grant such further and/or alternative relief as this Honourable Court deems fit.

### 16. CONCLUSION
16.1 The evidence presented in this affidavit demonstrates that I built and managed 51+ Shopify stores generating R34.9 million annually with my late partner, Kayla Pretorius. Kayla was murdered on 13 July 2023. After her death, I continued managing the operations profitably.
16.2 On 30 March 2025, Ms. Farrar and the Applicant dumped two years of unallocated expenses into RegimA Worldwide Distribution and demanded I sign off within 12 hours. I used the deadline extension (until 6 June) to finalize reports and uncover fraud.
16.3 On 6 June 2025, I cooperated with the Applicant's request by providing comprehensive reports to Mr. Bantjies regarding Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC. My analysis revealed an 86% profit margin on rent charged to the group. I unknowingly reported fraud to one of the perpetrators—Mr. Bantjies, who owed R18.685 million to the trust.
16.4 One day after my cooperation, on 7 June 2025, the Applicant cancelled 15 UK business cards without notice, rendering documentation inaccessible. Four days after my fraud exposure, on 10 June 2025, Mr. Bantjies dismissed my audit request, stating he was "going on holiday."
16.5 The systematic sabotage campaign included: unauthorized R900,000 transfers (14-15 Feb), revenue diversions (1 Mar, 14 Apr), Shopify data expungement (22 May, 100% audit data loss), domain theft by Ms. Farrar's son's company (29 May), card cancellation (7 Jun), warehouse sabotage (8 Jul), and account emptying (11 Sep, R1.73M transferred).
16.6 The ex parte order was obtained through material non-disclosures and false statements, including Mr. Bantjies's undisclosed trustee status, his R18.685 million debt to the trust, the timeline showing card cancellation one day after my cooperation, false statements about UK payment flows (perjury—UK funded SA, not the reverse), and the omission of the R34.9 million revenue context.
16.7 I support an independent forensic audit by an impartial party (not Mr. Bantjies). Such an audit would reveal the systematic fraud, conflicts of interest, transfer pricing manipulation, and abuse of process that underlie this application.
16.8 Despite six months of systematic sabotage, I was still managing to pay creditors until the accounts were emptied on 11 September 2025. I respectfully submit that the balance of convenience overwhelmingly favors setting aside the ex parte order and granting the relief sought in this affidavit.
