Subject: Final TB's 
Hi Bernadine 
In preparation for our discussion tomorrow morning, herewith the final TB's and AJE's for the various companies.
The financial statements have all been updated and agree to these TB's. However, there have been a few disclosure changes that were promulgated during the past year that I need to bring into these financials before we can sign.

Kind regards, 
Danie Bantjes
