Ok will send shortly its just taking a long time to make sure there are no speculative claims or potentially defamatory opinions that are not substantiated by material evidence etc.. If we make one arbitrary comment that isn't irrefutable he will use it against us in every case for the next 10 years.. I'll send what I have so far in the next few minutes and we just need to double check it before finalizing.
Also attached is a character reference our formulation chemist gave me 🙂
Will send soon.
Warm Regards
Dan

By the way I forgot to ask last week. Do you know what the correct procedure is for this:
"I hereby irrevocably renounce ALL rights as beneficiary of the Faucitt Family Trust effective immediately. I want nothing from this trust. Any attempts to use trust mechanisms to control me are therefore legally void."
These trustees must be in debt or something.. these people are nuts..

	Perhaps the most important discovery is that Danie Bantjies was appointed as a trustee in July last year without my knowledge as detailed in an email from Rynette. He is the accountant for all the companies, commissioner of oaths on all company and trust documents and also a Debtor to Peter and Jacqui with over R18 million in call options becoming due in May 2026.. This is a significant conflict of interests. Given that I informed him (in what I understood to be his capacity as our accountant) in June 2025 of the financial fraud within the companies and furnished him with all the reports after which I requested an urgent forensic audit twice.. He said he was going away for 2 weeks. Iit now explains why he signed a supporting affidavit for Peter as we have been informed that the large transactions exceeding R5 million each was under his instruction whiole acting in his capacity as a trustee making restructuring decisions and reinvesting capital reserves. That is what SARS was actually auditing while the narrative was "IT expenses"..

	Hi Natan
	I'll add the material to the document you prepared now. The main thing I was trying to do is remove speculative claims, unfounded assumptions, potentially defamatory statements of a personal or private nature, medical diagnoses, emotionally charged assertions etc. so that the content remains focused on the evidence related to the business matters in question and behaviour as observed with motivating inference where necessary.
	Warm Regards
	Dan

	Hi Daniel,
	Where is the draft that Doron and I prepared? The document has to be in line with a format that a Court uses as per our draft. I appreciate this document for context, but we need it amplified with your documents as annexures. Please get this done urgently as we are losing valuable time.

	I have restructured many aspects to reference evidence directly rather than speculative claims now we just need Jacqui to review and provide final instructions for which evidence is immediately available and if anything needs correction.
	I will send my response with Shopify & Trust elements ASAP.
	Warm Regards

	Hi Doron
	Indeed I'm just ensuring I send the "hard evidence" as the points made in connection with supporting documents will be distinct from opinion-based assertions. That way we can clearly establish proven fact from disputed claim. I will send through the various parts as and when I can i'm going as fast as I can while still verifying different statements with our records.
	Warm Regards
	Dan & Jax

	Have you had a chance to prepare the note that natan and I had requested on Friday? When can we expect the note? 
	We need to explain the relevance of the documents to the Court - otherwise we do not have a substantive basis to anticipate / reconsider the ex Arte order.

		Please find attached invoices I have going back to June 2023 as proof that the company RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd owned by Faucitt Family Trust is entirely dependent on the Shopify platform paid for by independent UK company RegimA Zone Ltd owned 100% by Daniel Faucitt and funded entirely by Daniel Faucitt.
		Thus the sole source of revenue for all income to the trust owned entity is dependent on the Shopify platform owned by Daniel Faucitt's company. Without this it would have zero revenue since 2023.
		This is relevant to why it appears that Trustees hijacked their own revenue stream, extracted PII in violation of ZA POPIA and UK GDPR and instructed customers to use a new email address and "order direct" from now on. This is because it was never their revenue stream to begin with. The entire operation and all funds flowing through the account were always owned by Daniel Faucitt's UK company RegimA Zone Ltd.
		So the characterization of Daniel being dependent on the company is false. In fact all revenue for all companies was dependent on Daniel Faucitt's infrastructure.
