Hi Danny,

Trust you are keeping well.

Just a quick update, we are looking at the investigation options we discussed.

I have got the attorney on standby to review your legal documents; we are just waiting for the copy of the interdict.

Once I have that feedback, we will meet again to discuss the way forward.

I have sent an invoice to Jacqui on whatsapp, she has asked me to email it to you so you could arrange payment.

Thank you.

Kind regards,
Stefan Grippa.
