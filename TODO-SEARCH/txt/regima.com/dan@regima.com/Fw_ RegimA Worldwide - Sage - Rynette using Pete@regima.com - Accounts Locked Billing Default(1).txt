Attached please find Daniel Faucitt personal bank records for months preceding, including and following the 500k loan transfer. The balance on 16 July speaks for itself in terms of timing.
Peter is intentionally trying to jump to the position of what mental conditions could cause spending on compulsive gambling and porn despite the hard evidence demonstrating all the company IT expenses being paid from my personal account.
Thus the main priority is submitting the actual evidence and refuting the central claim as proven false.
Warm Regards,
Dan
