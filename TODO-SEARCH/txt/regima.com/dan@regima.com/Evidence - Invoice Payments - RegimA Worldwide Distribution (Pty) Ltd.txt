Please find attached invoices I have going back to June 2023 as proof that the company RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd owned by Faucitt Family Trust is entirely dependent on the Shopify platform paid for by independent UK company RegimA Zone Ltd owned 100% by Daniel Faucitt and funded entirely by Daniel Faucitt.
Thus the sole source of revenue for all income to the trust owned entity is dependent on the Shopify platform owned by Daniel Faucitt's company. Without this it would have zero revenue since 2023.
This is relevant to why it appears that Trustees hijacked their own revenue stream, extracted PII in violation of ZA POPIA and UK GDPR and instructed customers to use a new email address and "order direct" from now on. This is because it was never their revenue stream to begin with. The entire operation and all funds flowing through the account were always owned by Daniel Faucitt's UK company RegimA Zone Ltd.
So the characterization of Daniel being dependent on the company is false. In fact all revenue for all companies was dependent on Daniel Faucitt's infrastructure.
