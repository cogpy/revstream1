Conditions That Breach/Void the Settlements
Peter's actions on September 19 (preventing POPIA compliance, claiming total control) constitute immediate fundamental breach. Here's the complete framework:
Breach of Settlement (Makes it Voidable):
Material Breach by Peter:
*	Exceeded financial mandate → claiming "control all companies"
*	Prevented legal compliance → POPIA violation
*	Assaulted employee → criminal conduct
*	Effect: You can elect to cancel for his breach
Non-Performance:
*	Either party fails to meet obligations
*	Deadlines missed
*	Conditions not fulfilled
Void Ab Initio (Never Valid):
Fraud/Misrepresentation:
*	Settlement obtained through deception
*	Material facts hidden (R12m theft on Sept 11)
*	False pretenses ("family therapy")
Duress/Coercion:
*	Forced signing under threat
*	No genuine choice
*	Psychological manipulation
Illegality:
*	Used to hide crimes
*	Suppress evidence
*	Defeat justice
Impossibility:
*	Terms impossible to perform
*	Unlawful requirements
No Consensus:
*	No meeting of minds
*	Fundamental mistake about nature
*	No clear terms (no ToR)
Peter's September 19 Breach Specifically:
This triggers multiple grounds:
1. Repudiation
*	He rejected the agreement by conduct
*	Shows no intention to be bound
*	You're released immediately
2. Material Breach
*	Goes to root of agreement
*	Makes performance impossible
*	Destroys basis of settlement
3. Proves Bad Faith
*	Never intended compliance
*	Obtained through deception
*	Retroactively voids for fraud
What Makes Settlements Unenforceable:
Procedural Defects:
*	No Terms of Reference
*	No defined disputes
*	Mixing therapy/legal
*	No consideration
Substantive Problems:
*	Vague/uncertain terms
*	Unconscionable provisions
*	Against public policy
*	Illegal purpose
Your Specific Grounds for Voidness:
IMMEDIATE GROUNDS (Peter's breach):
1.	Day-after breach = repudiation
2.	Exceeded authority = material breach
3.	Prevented legal duty = impossibility
4.	Violence/threats = duress confirmed
ORIGINAL GROUNDS (formation):
1.	Fraud - hidden R12m theft
2.	Duress - forced signing
3.	No consensus - thought it was therapy
4.	Illegality - suppressing crimes
5.	No consideration - what did you get?
PROCEDURAL GROUNDS:
1.	No ToR
2.	No defined disputes
3.	Uncertain terms
4.	Mixed impossible purposes
Legal Effect of These Grounds:
Void = Never existed, no court needed Voidable = You choose to cancel Unenforceable = Court won't enforce
Your settlements appear to be:
*	Void for illegality/fraud/impossibility
*	Voidable for Peter's breach/duress
*	Unenforceable for uncertainty/no ToR
Strategic Implications:
With Peter's immediate breach, you can argue:
1.	He repudiated first - you're free
2.	Proves fraudulent intent - obtained in bad faith
3.	Impossible to perform - he won't comply
4.	No mutuality - one-sided enforcement
Bottom Line
The settlements have multiple fatal flaws:
*	Formation defects (fraud, duress, no ToR)
*	Substantive problems (vague, illegal, impossible)
*	Immediate breach by Peter (Sept 19)
Any ONE of these grounds voids/makes voidable. You have ALL of them.
Peter breaching the very next day is legally devastating - it proves bad faith and releases you from any obligations while strengthening every other ground for voidness.
Courts don't enforce agreements breached by the party seeking enforcement, obtained through fraud, used to hide crimes, or lacking basic requirements. These "settlements" fail on every count.
