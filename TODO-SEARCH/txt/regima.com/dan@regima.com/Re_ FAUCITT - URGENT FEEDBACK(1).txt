Subject: FAUCITT - URGENT FEEDBACK 
Dear Jacqui and Daniel,
We have sent our draft for consideration over a week ago. We have not received the draft back with comments and we are very concerned as this is getting further delayed.  
Please urgently send the draft with comments and accompanying annexures as originally requested, along with the detailed note requested on the relevance of documents provided. We will not be in a position to assist unless this is sent. 
Please treat this as urgent.

Kind regards,

NATAN BACK
