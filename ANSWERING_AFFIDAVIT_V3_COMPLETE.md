# Answering Affidavit Structure (V3 - Complete)
## Case 2025-137857: 3rd Urgent Application

**Date:** 2025-11-18  
**Author:** Manus AI  
**Integration:** Fraud investigation + R500k fabrication + Sequential interdicts

---

## Executive Summary

This answering affidavit integrates three devastating lines of evidence that transform the case from a defensive response to allegations into an offensive exposure of systematic fraud, perjury, and abuse of court process:

1. **Accounting Fraud:** Rynette Farrar Bantjies instructed accountants to fabricate financial statements for a company that didn't exist under that name.
2. **R500k Fabrication:** Peter Faucitt's "birthday gift" narrative is proven false by bank statements showing reimbursement for sabotaged company expenses.
3. **Sequential Interdicts:** This is the third application in three months, demonstrating a pattern of retaliatory litigation.

## Part A: Preliminary Matters (Para 1-4)

**Para 1: Identity and Locus Standi**

I am Jacqueline Faucitt, an adult female. I am a director of the Third Respondent (RegimA SA (Pty) Ltd) and a member of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Respondents (RegimA ZA CC, Villa Via CC, and Haus Haus CC). I am competent to depose to this affidavit, and the facts herein are within my personal knowledge unless otherwise indicated.

**Para 2: Purpose of this Affidavit**

I oppose the urgent application filed on November 4, 2025. The purpose of this affidavit is to demonstrate that the Applicant's case is founded on deliberate misrepresentations, that the relief sought is a disguised attempt to remove a director without lawful process, and that this application is the latest step in a campaign of retaliatory litigation designed to obstruct my investigation of systematic financial fraud.

**Para 3: Point in Limine: Lack of Urgency**

The events complained of in the Applicant's founding affidavit occurred primarily in late September 2025. The Applicant waited over a month to file this "urgent" application. Moreover, I had already undertaken not to attend the training session that forms the basis of paragraphs 6.6-6.9 of the founding affidavit, thereby resolving the immediate issue. The urgency is self-created and tactical, designed to prevent proper scrutiny of the Applicant's conduct. This application does not meet the requirements for urgent relief under Rule 6(12).

**Para 4: Point in Limine: Abuse of Process**

This is the **third sequential interdict application** filed against the Respondents in the space of three months:

- **Application 1:** August 13, 2025 (ex parte interdict)
- **Application 2:** October 2025 (settlement enforcement)
- **Application 3:** November 4, 2025 (this application)

Each application has followed the Respondents exercising legitimate rights or demanding accountability. This pattern demonstrates a campaign of retaliatory litigation, not a bona fide attempt to protect business interests. The Court's process is being weaponized to silence directors who are investigating financial misconduct. This constitutes an abuse of process, and the application should be dismissed on this ground alone.

## Part B: The True Context: Discovery of Accounting Fraud (Para 5-10)

**Para 5: The "Unknown Transactions" Are Evidence of Fraud**

The Applicant's founding affidavit (Para 7.5) refers to "unknown transactions" and correspondence with the company's accountants, De Novo (Annexure AF10). The Applicant characterizes my participation in this correspondence as part of an "escalation of misconduct." This is a gross misrepresentation. These are not mere irregularities; they are evidence of **systematic accounting fraud**.

**Para 6: The Fabricated Financial Statements**

I have evidence that Rynette Farrar Bantjies, the Applicant's partner and the de facto controller of the companies' financial systems, instructed De Novo accountants to create financial statements for "RegimA SA" for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. These statements are **fraudulent** because the company was not called "RegimA SA" during that period. The company was called "K-Oz Creative" and was owned by the Second Respondent (Daniel Faucitt) and his then-partner, Kayla. The company was only renamed "RegimA SA" in 2023, when the Applicant was added as a director. I attach CIPC records as Annexure **JA1** showing the company's true history.

**Para 7: Destruction of Evidence**

The same correspondence (Annexure AF10) reveals that Rynette Farrar Bantjies instructed De Novo to **remove the Second Respondent's QuickBooks records**. These were the true financial records of the company. Their removal and replacement with fabricated accounts constitutes the destruction of evidence and is a criminal offense.

**Para 8: My Fiduciary Duty to Investigate**

As a director of RegimA SA, I have a fiduciary duty under **Section 76 of the Companies Act** to act with care, skill, and diligence, and in the best interests of the company. Upon discovering evidence of this fraud in or around August 2025, I was legally and ethically obligated to investigate. My demand to be copied on correspondence with the accountants was not "harassment"—it was the discharge of my legal duty.

**Para 9: The Applicant's True Motive: Obstruction of Justice**

Every action the Applicant complains of in his founding affidavit was a direct result of my investigation into this fraud. This application, which seeks to sever my contact with the company, its employees, and its accountants, is a transparent attempt to **obstruct my investigation** and conceal the fraud. The Applicant is not seeking to protect the business; he is seeking to protect the perpetrators of financial crimes.

**Para 10: The Pattern of Retaliation**

The timeline is clear:

- **August 2025:** I discovered the fabricated accounts and began investigating.
- **August 25, 2025:** I demanded to be copied on correspondence with De Novo.
- **September 2025:** I participated in correspondence about the "unknown transactions."
- **November 4, 2025:** The Applicant filed this application to prohibit me from having any contact with the companies or accountants.

This is not business protection—it is retaliation against whistleblowing.

## Part C: The R500k "Birthday Gift" Fabrication (Para 11-16)

**Para 11: The False Narrative**

In previous affidavits and correspondence, the Applicant has claimed that the Second Respondent (Daniel Faucitt) received a "R500k birthday gift" and likely used it for gambling. This narrative has been used to justify the Applicant's control over company finances and to discredit the Second Respondent. I now have irrefutable evidence that this narrative is a **deliberate fabrication**.

**Para 12: The Card Cancellation Sabotage**

On June 6, 2025, the Second Respondent filed a fraud report with the South African Police Service (SAPS) regarding financial misconduct within the companies. **One day later**, on June 7, 2025, the Applicant secretly cancelled the company credit cards that were used for all operational expenses. This action caused all recurring business expenses (including Shopify subscriptions, software services, and cloud infrastructure) to default to the emergency backup card: the Second Respondent's personal credit card.

**Para 13: The Involuntary Lending**

For six weeks, the Second Respondent's personal account was forced to pay for all of the company's operational expenses. I attach the Second Respondent's personal bank statements for June and July 2025 as Annexure **JA2**. These statements show:

- **June 4, 2025:** Account balance of R48,996.11.
- **July 4, 2025:** Account balance of R24,314.31 (a decline of 50.3%).
- Despite receiving R100,000 in transfers during this period, the account declined because company expenses exceeded the transfers.
- The bank statements clearly show transaction descriptions for business expenses: Shopify, Airbrake, CircleCI, Character.AI, Gitbook, Cursor, Stackblitz, Supabase, Cloudflare, and other development tools and services.

**Para 14: The R500k Reimbursement**

By July 16, 2025, the cumulative effect of these business expenses caused the Second Respondent's personal account to go into a negative balance. On the same day, he transferred R500,000 from **his own company** (K-Oz Creative / RegimA SA), of which he is the founding member, into his personal account. This was not a "loan" or a "gift." It was **reimbursement** for the six weeks of company expenses he had been forced to cover due to the Applicant's sabotage.

**Para 15: The "Medical Expert" Deception**

The Applicant provided the Second Respondent's bank statements to a "psychologist/medical expert" and obtained a report speculating that the Second Respondent "likely had a gambling addiction." This was a bad faith attempt to obscure the hard evidence. The Applicant had the bank statements, which clearly show transaction descriptions proving the expenses were for business, not gambling. The expert was given misleading terms of reference and was not shown the transaction descriptions. This demonstrates the Applicant's willingness to manipulate evidence and mislead the Court.

**Para 16: The Strongest Evidence of Retaliation**

The fact that the card cancellation occurred **one day after** the Second Respondent filed a fraud report is irrefutable evidence of **retaliatory motive**. The Applicant's actions were designed to inflict financial harm and disrupt operations in retaliation for whistleblowing. This is not the conduct of a bona fide business owner; it is the conduct of someone attempting to punish and silence those who expose wrongdoing.

## Part D: Answering the Allegations: Fiduciary Duty in Action (Para 17-20)

**Para 17: Re: Demanding Correspondence (Applicant's Para 7.2-7.5)**

My demand to be copied on correspondence, particularly with the accountants De Novo, was not "harassment." It was the **exercise of my directorial right and duty** under Section 26 of the Companies Act to access company records, and under Section 76 to investigate the fraudulent accounting I had discovered. The Applicant seeks to prevent me from obtaining further evidence of the fraud.

**Para 18: Re: Demanding Salary (Applicant's Para 6.2-6.5)**

My inquiry about remuneration is a legitimate right of a director. More importantly, in the context of discovering that millions in revenue were being funneled through a system I had no access to (controlled by Rynette Farrar Bantjies), my inquiries were aimed at understanding the true financial state of the company and how funds were being disbursed. This was not "harassment"; it was oversight.

**Para 19: Re: Attending Company Premises (Applicant's Para 6.6-6.9)**

My intention to attend the company's premises and training sessions was to exercise my oversight duty as a director. The Applicant's claim that I would be "disruptive" is a self-serving attempt to justify his unlawful exclusion of a director from the company's operations, precisely at the time she is uncovering wrongdoing. I note that I have already undertaken not to attend the training session, rendering this aspect of the application moot.

**Para 20: Summary: My Actions Were Lawful, Justified, and Necessary**

Every action the Applicant complains of was a reasonable and necessary step in the investigation of serious financial misconduct. It is the Applicant who is acting unlawfully by seeking to use the Court to aid and abet the concealment of fraud.

---

## Part E: Disproportionate and Punitive Relief (Para 21-22)

**Para 21: The Relief Sought is a Disguised Removal of a Director**

The Applicant seeks to prohibit me from having any contact with the companies, their employees, partners, or clientele, except through the Applicant's attorneys during office hours. This would make it impossible for me to perform my duties as a director. This is not a protective interdict; it is a de facto removal of a director, for which the Applicant has followed no lawful process under the Companies Act.

**Para 22: The Relief Would Enable Further Fraud**

Granting the order would have the perverse effect of allowing the perpetrators of the accounting fraud to continue their activities without oversight. The Court would be sanctioning the silencing of a whistleblower and enabling the concealment of criminal conduct.

---

## Part F: Conclusion and Prayer (Para 23-25)

**Para 23: Summary of Argument**

This application is a gross abuse of process. It is the third in a series of retaliatory applications. It is based on deliberate misrepresentations of fact, including the fabricated "R500k birthday gift" narrative and the concealment of the accounting fraud I am investigating. Its true purpose is to obstruct the investigation of financial crimes and to silence directors who are exercising their fiduciary duties.

**Para 24: Costs**

The Applicant's conduct is vexatious and malicious. He has misled the Court in three separate applications. He has fabricated narratives, manipulated expert evidence, and weaponized the Court's process to retaliate against whistleblowers. A punitive costs order on the attorney and own client scale is warranted.

**Para 25: Prayer**

WHEREFORE I pray that:

1. The application be dismissed with costs on the attorney and own client scale.
2. Such further and/or alternative relief as the Court deems fit.
