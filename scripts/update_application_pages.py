**Application Type:** Ex parte urgent application  
**Filed:** August 13, 2025

---

## Critical Timeline

### Trigger Event
**August 11, 2025:** Jacqueline signs "Main Trustee" document

**August 13, 2025:** First interdict filed (**36 days later**)

This timeline demonstrates **retaliatory motive** under *Beinash v Wixley* - the application was filed in direct response to legitimate POPIA enforcement action.
