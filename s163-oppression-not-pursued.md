# Section 163 Oppression Application
## NOT PURSUED (Insufficient Evidence)

**Potential Applicant:** Daniel James Faucitt  
**Potential Respondent:** Peter Andrew Faucitt  
**Legal Basis:** Companies Act 71 of 2008, Section 163  
**Status:** **NOT PURSUED** - Insufficient evidence  
**Date:** 2025-12-05

## Why This Application Is NOT Pursued

### Evidence Required (NOT Available)

| Evidence Type | Description | Status |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Interdiction documentation | Written instructions denying Daniel office access | ❌ **NOT AVAILABLE** |
| Access denial records | Security logs, building access records | ❌ **NOT AVAILABLE** |
| Communications | Emails, letters regarding interdiction | ❌ **NOT AVAILABLE** |
| Director appointment records | Proof Daniel is director of RegimA SA | ⚠️ **REQUIRED** |
| Witness statements | Testimony about interdiction | ❌ **NOT AVAILABLE** |

### Alleged Oppressive Conduct (UNPROVEN)

**Allegation:** Peter interdicted Daniel from office access, preventing Daniel from exercising director duties for RegimA SA.

**Problem:** No evidence of interdiction available.

**Burden of Proof:** 50% (civil) - **NOT MET**

## Section 163 Requirements

**For s163 oppression application, must prove:**
1. Applicant is director, shareholder, or related person
2. Respondent engaged in oppressive or prejudicial conduct
3. Conduct unfairly prejudiced or disregarded applicant's interests
4. Applicant has no other adequate remedy

**Evidence Status:**
1. ✅ Daniel is director of RegimA SA (if provable via CIPC)
2. ❌ No evidence of oppressive conduct (interdiction)
3. ❌ Cannot prove prejudice without evidence of interdiction
4. ✅ No other remedy for interdiction (if it occurred)

**Overall:** **INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE**

## What Would Be Required

**If interdiction evidence becomes available:**

### Evidence Needed

1. **Interdiction documentation**
   - Written instructions from Peter to deny Daniel access
   - Security instructions
   - Building access denial records

2. **Communications**
   - Emails regarding interdiction
   - Letters denying access
   - Text messages or other communications

3. **Witness statements**
   - Security personnel testimony
   - Staff testimony about access denial
   - Daniel's own testimony

4. **Director appointment records**
   - CIPC records showing Daniel as director of RegimA SA
   - Board resolutions appointing Daniel
   - Director register entries

### Grounds (If Evidence Available)

**Ground 1: Interdiction from Office**
- Peter denied Daniel access to office
- Daniel prevented from exercising director duties
- Unfairly prejudicial to Daniel's interests as director

**Ground 2: Facilitation of Fraud**
- Interdiction prevented Daniel from detecting fraud
- RegimA SA suffered R10,269,727.90 loss
- Daniel's oversight duties impeded

**Ground 3: Breach of Director Equality**
- Peter exercised director powers while denying Daniel's
- Violated principle of director equality
- Unfairly prejudicial to Daniel

**Ground 4: Conflict of Interest and Bad Faith**
- Peter's dual director status (RST and RegimA SA)
- Interdiction served Peter's interests (prevented oversight)
- Acted in bad faith toward Daniel

## Current Recommendation

**DO NOT PURSUE s163 oppression application** unless and until:
1. Interdiction evidence becomes available
2. Director appointment records for Daniel obtained
3. Witness statements collected
4. Communications regarding interdiction located

**Focus instead on:**
- s162 delinquent director application against Peter (STRONG evidence)
- Civil damages claims (STRONG evidence)
- Criminal charges against Rynette (STRONG evidence)

---

## If Evidence Becomes Available

**If interdiction evidence is obtained:**
1. Immediately reassess s163 viability
2. Draft s163 application based on evidence
3. File on urgent basis (restore Daniel's access)
4. Coordinate with s162 application

**Until then:** Focus on provable claims with strong evidence.
