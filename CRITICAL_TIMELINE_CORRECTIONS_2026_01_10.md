## Verification Required

The following items require manual verification:

1. Check all legal filings for references to Kayla's death date
2. Verify all events dated 2021-2022 don't incorrectly reference post-death events
3. Ensure all estate-related events are dated post-2023-07-13
4. Confirm email seizure timeline in court documents
5. Review ad-res-j7 evidence for any conflicting dates

- Estate documentation before death (impossible)
- Email seizure before death (impossible)
- Confusion between director resignation and job resignation

The corrected timeline now accurately reflects:
- Kayla's murder on 13 July 2023 as the trigger event
- Estate complications occurring AFTER death
- 2021 director resignation as purely administrative
- Clear separation between corporate restructuring (2021) and murder (2023)

**All legal filings and documentation must be updated to reflect these corrections.**
