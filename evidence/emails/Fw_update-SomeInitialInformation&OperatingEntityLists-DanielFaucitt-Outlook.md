Hi Danie
I have been going over the figures you sent and trying to make sense of the current perceived view as
compared with the actual situation in order to converge on an accurate representation of how the
companies work together over the span of supply chain activities. Most notably that since I las did
the accounts myself in July 2023 it appears everything is just showing up as supplier "FNB" in
Worldwide (default for the bank feed) indicating that nobody has actually processed any of those

accounts since Aug 2023. As a result, everything is in the wrong companies and nothing has been
reconciled..
!!! Important !!! I notice that from the one account detail I can see in RegimA Skin Treatments, a
minimum of just over a million has been misallocated resulting in vanishing debt. This and likely
other issues needs to be urgently rectified as if submitted as is it may be viewed as fraudulent by the
receiver since it misreports forex transactions by the same amount.
There are many other issues which I will address in order of urgency in follow-up mails but had to
send you something in the meantime. Below I list the companies as Legal Entities as well as the
registry for Quickbooks and 2 ZA Shopify hubs.. there are more for UK and EU.. but for now I need to
try and give you an idea of the broader perspective.
There is a great deal missing from the full picture including the context of the 2 Marketplaces, 4
Distribution platforms with 36 Shopify Stores and over 1100 B2B Salon Tenants.
Also the 4 Companies that operate these Distribution hubs are generating sales figures and
populating acounts which you have never seen as far as i know..
Firstly, I added a whole reference library of supporting documents, templates and analyses that will
be useful for refining a relevant operating framework.
For the moment there is a temporary site here with detailed info related to computer related
categorization:
https://lsdhynli.manus.space/
In addition here is a work-in-progress dashboard of the whole supply chain with its 3 primary
systems:
Hypergraph B2B Integration System Simulation
Below D, J, P are Dan, Jax & Pete Director / Shareholder indicators.. so there are 4 Legally distinct
groups between which simple intercompany transactions require additional transactions in order to
justify asset transfer etc.
