**Date:** 8 July 2025
**Case Number:** 2025-137857

### Executive Summary:
Dan sent a POPIA Violation Notice to Peter on 8 July 2025 after discovering:
1. Peter instructed staff to use a new system only accessible to him and Rynette
2. Revenue streams redirected such that audit trail had disappeared
3. Notice titled: "FORMAL NOTICE - CESSATION OF CRIMINAL INSTRUCTIONS"

### Retaliation Timeline:

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 6 June 2025 | Dan & Jacqui report fraud concerns to accountant (Bantjies) | Initial whistleblowing |
| 7 June 2025 | Peter cancels ALL cards (1 day later) | Immediate retaliation |
| 7 June 2025 | R1,062,446.04 company expenses forced onto Dan's personal account | Financial punishment |
| 8 July 2025 | Dan sends POPIA Violation Notice to Peter | Formal compliance demand |

| 19 August 2025 | Ex parte order granted based on Peter's false narrative | Court deceived |

### Critical Findings:
1. **Peter's ex parte application was RETALIATION** for Dan's POPIA violation notice
2. Dan's "harassment" was actually **legitimate POPIA compliance**
3. Peter was **concealing audit trails** to enable fraudulent tax returns

### Integration with Shopify Analysis:
- RegimA Zone UK owns revenue stream (pays platform fees)

- ~ZAR 60M in fraudulent tax returns (13 months post-Kayla's murder)
- POPIA notice proves Peter redirected revenue streams
- Audit trail disappearance enabled fraudulent tax returns
