## PETER'S SWORN STATEMENT (Founding Affidavit, Paragraph 7.18)

> "She adopted an 'I will show you' approach, defended our son, and then **transferred to him the sum of R500,000.00 from the corporations**, on or about 16 July 2025, **as a 'birthday gift'**, which **I did not authorise**, and which **he was not entitled to accept**; She has no other sources of income other than her remuneration by the third to sixth respondents."

### Peter's Claims Under Oath:
1. **"She" (Jacqueline) transferred the money** — Attributing the action to his wife
2. **"from the corporations"** — Implying company funds were misappropriated
3. **"as a 'birthday gift'"** — Characterizing it as personal enrichment
4. **"I did not authorise"** — Claiming he had no knowledge or approval
5. **"he was not entitled to accept"** — Implying Daniel acted improperly

## THE ACTUAL EVIDENCE

### Source: Daniel J Faucitt Personal Bank Statement
- **Account:** FNB Fusion Private Wealth Acc: 62471764946
- **Statement Period:** 4 July 2025 to 4 August 2025
- **Document:** D_FAUCITT_PERSONAL_BANK_RECORDS_20250804.pdf

### The Transaction (Page 2):
| Date | Description | Amount | Balance |
|------|-------------|--------|---------|
| 16 Jul | FNB OB Pmt Daniel J Faucitt | 500,000.00 Cr | 550,864.45 Cr |

### Key Observations:
1. **Daniel was the RECIPIENT** — The transaction is a CREDIT (incoming)
2. **Daniel did NOT initiate the transfer** — He received it passively
3. **The description shows it was sent TO Daniel** — "FNB OB Pmt Daniel J Faucitt"

---

## THE CRITICAL REVELATION

### Jacqueline Did Not Know About the Transfer

According to the Respondent's testimony:
- **Jacqueline Faucitt was unaware of this transfer**
- **She did not authorize or initiate it**
- **Peter's attribution to her is FALSE**

### The Logical Conclusion:

If Jacqueline didn't make the transfer, and Daniel only received it, then **WHO made the transfer?**

| Possibility | Analysis |
|-------------|----------|
| Jacqueline | **RULED OUT** — She didn't know about it |
| Daniel | **RULED OUT** — He was the recipient, not sender |
| Third Party | **UNLIKELY** — Would require account access |
| **Peter** | **MOST LIKELY** — Had access, motive, and opportunity |

## THE MANUFACTURED EVIDENCE SCHEME

### Timeline of Events:

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 6 Jun 2025 | Daniel exposes fraud to Bantjies | Trigger event |
| 7 Jun 2025 | Daniel's company cards cancelled | Retaliation begins |
| **16 Jul 2025** | **R500,000 transferred TO Daniel** | **Evidence manufactured** |
| 19 Aug 2025 | Ex parte interdict granted | Scheme succeeds |
| 3-11 Sep 2025 | R10.6M+ moved to savings accounts | Real extraction occurs |

### The Setup:

1. **Step 1:** Cancel Daniel's cards (7 Jun) — Cut off his legitimate access
2. **Step 2:** Transfer R500K TO Daniel (16 Jul) — Create "evidence" of extraction
3. **Step 3:** Attribute transfer to Jacqueline — Deflect suspicion from Peter
4. **Step 4:** Label it "birthday gift" — Make it look like personal enrichment
5. **Step 5:** File ex parte interdict (19 Aug) — Use manufactured evidence
6. **Step 6:** Seize control of all accounts — The actual goal achieved
7. **Step 7:** Extract R10.6M+ (Sep) — The real theft occurs

## LEGAL IMPLICATIONS

### Perjury (Criminal)

Peter swore under oath that:
- "She" (Jacqueline) transferred the money — **FALSE** (she didn't know)
- It was a "birthday gift" — **UNSUBSTANTIATED** (no evidence of this characterization)
- He "did not authorise" it — **POTENTIALLY FALSE** (if he made the transfer himself)

**Section 319 of the Criminal Procedure Act** — Perjury is punishable by imprisonment.

### Fraud on the Court

The ex parte order was obtained based on:
- **Material misrepresentation** — False attribution of the transfer
- **Manufactured evidence** — The transfer itself may have been created as "proof"
- **Concealment** — Failure to disclose who actually made the transfer

### Abuse of Process

The interdict was used to:
- Seize control of companies Daniel legitimately co-owned
- Remove Daniel's banking authority (as Online Banking Administrator)
- Enable the subsequent extraction of R10.6M+

## COMPARISON: Peter's "Urgency" vs Reality

### Peter's Claim (Paragraph 16.2):
> "On or about 16 July 2025, when the first respondent transferred the sum of R500,000.00 to the second respondent, it became clear that action had to be taken to protect the third to sixth respondents."

### The Reality:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total funds in accounts (Aug 2025) | R 13,930,329.92 |
| Amount allegedly "extracted" | R 500,000.00 |
| Percentage of total | **3.6%** |
| Time to deplete at this rate | **27.8 months** |

**There was NO URGENCY.** The accounts were flush with nearly R14 million.

### What Actually Happened After the Interdict:

| Date | Amount Moved | By Whom |
|------|--------------|---------|
| 3 Sep 2025 | R 5,164,131.18 | Peter (RWD → Savings) |
| 11 Sep 2025 | R 3,090,000.00 | Peter (RST → Savings) |
| 11 Sep 2025 | R 1,730,000.00 | Peter (VVA → Savings) |
| 11 Sep 2025 | R 640,000.00 | Peter (SLG → Savings) |
| **TOTAL** | **R 10,624,131.18** | **In 8 days** |

**Peter moved 21x more money in 8 days than Daniel allegedly "extracted" in a month.**

---

## CONCLUSION

The R500,000 "birthday gift" claim in Peter's founding affidavit appears to be:

1. **A fabricated narrative** — Jacqueline didn't know about the transfer
2. **Manufactured evidence** — Created specifically to justify the interdict
3. **Perjury** — False statements made under oath
4. **Fraud on the court** — Material misrepresentation to obtain relief
5. **The vehicle for a larger scheme** — To seize control and extract R10.6M+

The interdict was not obtained to "protect" the companies — it was obtained to **enable** the extraction of over R10 million while excluding the legitimate co-owner (Daniel) who had exposed fraud.
