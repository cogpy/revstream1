## Analysis & Implications

### Pattern of Asset Concealment

1. **Systematic Drainage:** All four Current accounts were reduced to less than R 16,000 each
2. **Coordinated Timing:** Three entities transferred on the same day (Sep 11)
3. **Large Single Transfer:** RWD moved R 5.16M eight days earlier (Sep 3)
4. **Missing Funds:** R 5.4M cannot be accounted for in either Current or Savings

### Legal Significance

This pattern is consistent with:

- **Asset preservation/concealment** ahead of potential legal action
- **Creating appearance of depleted operational accounts** for creditors
- **Potential violation of court orders** if any interdicts were in place
- **Evidence of consciousness of guilt** regarding pending litigation

### Questions Raised

1. Who authorized these coordinated transfers?
2. Where did the missing R 5.4M go?
3. Were these transfers disclosed to the court?
4. Do the Savings accounts appear in asset declarations?
