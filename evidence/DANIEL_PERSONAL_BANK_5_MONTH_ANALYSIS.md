## SUMMARY: THE COMPLETE PICTURE

### What Peter Claimed:
> Daniel "extracted" R500,000 as a "birthday gift"

### What The Evidence Shows:

| Fact | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| Daniel transferred R520K FROM his savings | Bank records show 12 transfers |
| Daniel's balance hit R864.45 | 16 Jul statement shows this |
| The R500K came AFTER he was nearly broke | Transaction sequence proves this |
| Daniel was NET NEGATIVE by R20K | R520K out vs R500K in |
| Daniel continued funding himself post-interdict | Sep transfers from savings |

---

## CONCLUSION

The R500,000 transfer on 16 July 2025 was not "extraction" or a "birthday gift."

It was **partial reimbursement** for the **R520,000+ Daniel had already transferred from his personal savings** to cover business expenses after his company cards were secretly cancelled on 7 June 2025.

**Peter's narrative is not just false — it's the exact opposite of the truth.**

Daniel didn't take from the company. **Daniel was funding the company out of his own pocket**, and the R500K was an attempt to recover some of what he'd already put in.
