FORMAL NOTICE - CESSATION OF CRIMINAL INSTRUCTIONS.docx;

This is the letter I sent to Pete on 8th July 2025 when I discovered that he had instructed staff to use a
new system only accessible to him and Rynette & redirected the revenue streams such that the audit
trail had disappeared.
warm regards,
Dan
