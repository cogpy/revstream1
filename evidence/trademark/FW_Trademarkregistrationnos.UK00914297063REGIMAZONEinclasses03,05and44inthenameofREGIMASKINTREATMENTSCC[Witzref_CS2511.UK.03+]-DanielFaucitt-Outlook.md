Dear Jacqui
Thank you for your email.
We note that you are no longer interested in the REGIMA ZONE mark in the EU and confirm that we will take no further
action and allow the EU trade mark registration for REGIMA ZONE to lapse without incurring any further costs.
Please will you confirm whether you are still interested in maintaining UK Trade mark registration nos. UK00914297063
REGIMA ZONE in classes 03, 05 and 44.
The costs involved in renewing the REGIMA ZONE registrations in the UK for a further 10 years (calculated from the
abovementioned renewal date, even if the renewal is filed before this date) will be in the region of R23,900 (including
VAT, agents fees, disbursements and official fees). Please note that the cost is an estimate only, as it is subject to constant
exchange rate fluctuations.
If you are still interested in maintaining the REGIMA ZONE mark in the UK, we will require a R13, 000 deposit in our trust
account to cover our agents’ fees and disbursements in the UK. Please note that this is not cover for our fees (we will
send you a reconciled invoice reflecting our fees, your deposit and the actual disbursements once we have made the
international foreign currency payments and the bank has provided us with the actual Rand equivalent); you are a valued
existing client with an impeccable payment record, so please do not feel offended at all. This is simply an internal rule
that is outside our control, as we have to take cover for substantial disbursements (the foreign agents will invoice our
firm, we are responsible for payment to them, and we have to settle their accounts promptly).
You have our banking details but please let us know if you need any other paperwork from our side to enable you to pay
the deposit into our trust account, using our reference CS2511 / MR000559. Although we will pick the payment up on
our bank statement, please send us an e-mail when you deposit the money so that we can specifically look out for it and
allocate it to your matter.
If you are no longer interested in maintaining the mark, we can allow it to lapse without incurring any costs.
Let us know if you have any questions.
Kind regards,

Dear Jacqui
As you know, the EU used to include and cover the UK but ever since Brexit, the UK no longer forms part of the EU and is
treated as a completely separate country. If you, therefore, require protection in both the 27 EU member states and the
UK then you have to renew the trade mark in both jurisdictions. Put differently, the UK registration is now a completely
separate registration with its own life in a separate country and if you require continued protection in the UK, you have to
renew that separately. If you require continued protection in the EU and its 27 member states, then you also have to
renew the EU registration.
We trust that this clarifies the matter.

Hi Jacqui
Confirmed. In the EU, the quoted costs are just for the REGIMA ZONE mark in classes 03, 05 and 44. We understand that
the amount appears high, but please keep the following in mind:
The official fees (i.e. the expenses that have to be paid to the EU trade marks office) alone is R24,000.
The renewal covers all 27 EU member states.
The costs should be amortised over a decade, as the mark is only renewable every 10 years.

Dear Jacqui and Pete
Further to our previous correspondence herein, and as advised below, we have now obtained an updated cost estimate
from our agent in the EU and can advise as follows.
The costs involved in renewing the registrations for a further 10 years (calculated from the abovementioned renewal
date, even if the renewal is filed before this date) will be in the region of R45,700 (including VAT, agents fees,
disbursements and official fees). Please note that the cost is an estimate only, as it is subject to constant exchange rate
fluctuations.
The vast majority of these costs are made up by our EU agent’s fees and disbursements. Unfortunately, European
attorneys are expensive and the cost are further magnified by the Rand/Pound exchange rate (more than R25 to the
Pound as of this morning).
Please let us know if you are happy to proceed with the renewal.
We look forward to hearing from you.

I am in business so do realise the fluctuations with the currencies. Yours just seems a bit higher than
normal.

Hi Jacqui
Thank you for your email, we will remind you closer to the time.
The vast majority of these fees are made up by our foreign agent’s disbursements in the EU and are high in light of the
Rand/Euro exchange rate.
Kind regards,

Dear Jacqui
Thank you for your emails.
You are correct, both marks are in the name of REGIMA SKIN TREATMENTS CC, as per my email below.
We note your instructions regarding the EU trade mark registration for the EPIGENERIST mark. We confirm that we will
take no further action and the mark will be allowed to lapse.
Insofar as the renewal of REGIMA ZONE is concerned, the costs involved in renewing the registration for a further 10
years (calculated from the abovementioned renewal date, even if the renewal is filed before this date) will be in the
region of R38, 575 (including VAT, agents fees, disbursements and official fees). Please note that the cost is an estimate
only, as it is subject to constant exchange rate fluctuations.
Please let us know if you are happy to proceed?
In addition, we have attached our email to you regarding the registrations in the UK, please will you let us have your
instructions insofar as those two registrations are concerned.
We look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards,

Dear Juanita
Thank you for this reminder. I have discussed with Danny and we would definitely want to keep
REGIMA ZONE but we do not want to renew the EPIGENERRIST. Would you therefore give us an
amended quote for just the REGIMA ZONE..
Kind regards

Dear Jacqui
EU: Trade mark registration no. 014297063 REGIMA ZONE in classes 03, 05 and 44
EU: Trade mark registration no. 014297113 EPIGENERIST in classes 03, 05 and 44 both in the name of REGIMA SKIN
TREATMENTS CC
The abovementioned 6 trade mark registrations are due for renewal on or before 25 June 2025, and we are therefore
now within the 6-month window prior to the expiry date where renewal of the registrations is possible.
The costs involved in renewing the registrations for a further 10 years (calculated from the abovementioned renewal
date, even if the renewals are filed before this date) will be in the region of R43, 700 (including VAT, agents fees,
disbursements and official fees). Please note that the costs are estimates only, as they are subject to constant exchange
rate fluctuations.
If you are still interested in the marks, please let us know so that we can file the renewals well in advance of the
deadline. If you have no further interest in the marks, please also let us know so that we can remove the marks from our
records and allow the registrations to lapse and be removed from the Register due to non-renewal.
Many thanks & best regards
