## Executive Summary

This page provides a **side-by-side comparison** of all three sequential interdict applications filed by Peter Faucitt against the respondents over a 3-month period (August-November 2025).

**Key Finding:** The three applications form a **coordinated pattern** consistent with a curatorship conspiracy, each building on the previous to establish grounds for ultimate seizure of the Faucitt Family Trust.

---

## Application 1: Ex Parte Interdict (August 13, 2025)

### [📄 Full Application 1 Details](application-1.html)

### Summary
- **Filed:** 2 days after Jacqueline signed "Main Trustee" document
- **Trigger:** POPIA violation notice sent 36 days earlier (July 8, 2025)
- **Nature:** Ex parte (no notice to respondents)
- **Effect:** Initial business isolation

### Critical Evidence Concealed

1. **POPIA Context:** [Violation notice](evidence/popia/POPIAViolationNotice-SenttoPeteon8July2025-DanielFaucitt-Outlook.pdf) sent July 8 → interdict filed Aug 13 (retaliatory)
2. **Shopify Platform:** Owned by Daniel's UK company since July 2023, not RWD ZA
3. **ReZonance Seizure:** [Peter and Rynette took control](evidence/rezonance/FW_RezonceREZONANCE23,24,25FEBS-DanielFaucitt-Outlook.pdf) after Kayla's death
4. **Sage Control:** [Accounting system seized](evidence/sage/SAGE_SCREENSHOTS_CONTROL_ANALYSIS.md.pdf), legitimate directors locked out
5. **Trustee Misconduct:** [Peter's own violations](evidence/emails/TRUSTEEFw_CopyofyourID-DanielFaucitt-Outlook.pdf) as trustee

### Legal Issues
- Material non-disclosure warranting rescission
- Retaliatory motive under *Beinash v Wixley*
- Court misled about true circumstances

### Curatorship Role
**Phase 1: Business Isolation** - Separate respondents from business operations, create appearance of protection need.

---

## Application 2: Settlement Enforcement (October 2025)

### [📄 Full Application 2 Details](application-2.html)

### Summary
- **Context:** Mediation held September 18, 2025
- **Withdrawal:** Respondents withdrew September 22 (4 days later)
- **Counsel Withdrawal:** ENS Attorneys withdrew September 23
- **Filed:** October 2025 to enforce agreements

### Agreements Sought to Enforce

1. **Medical Assessments**
   - Psychiatric evaluation
   - Drug screening
   - Reports to applicant and court

2. **Forensic Investigation**
   - Into entity affairs
   - Controlled by applicant
   - Would "legitimize" fraudulent narrative

### Why Respondents Withdrew

**Critical Discovery:** [CIPC records](evidence/cipc/347975701_REGIMA_SA_K201708793507.Pdf) prove backdating fraud:
- K OZ CREATIVE → REGIMA SA name change: **2021-03-09**
- Peter presented 2019 financial statements for "REGIMA SA"
- Entity was "K OZ CREATIVE" in 2019
- **Conclusion:** 2019 statements are fabricated

**Additional Evidence:**
- [R500K fabrication](BANK_STATEMENT_ANALYSIS_R500K_FABRICATION.txt) in bank statements
- [Fraudulent shell company operations](FRAUDULENT_SHELL_COMPANY_ANALYSIS.md)
- [Sage control](evidence/sage/SAGE_SCREENSHOTS_CONTROL_ANALYSIS.md.pdf) makes "investigation" illegitimate

### Legal Issues
- Agreements obtained without full disclosure
- Backdating fraud not revealed before mediation
- "Investigation" would be investigating records applicant controls
- ENS withdrawal suggests ethical concerns

### Curatorship Role
**Phase 2: Medical Labels** - Obtain psychiatric evaluation to label respondents as "incapacitated."

---

## Application 3: Contact Interdict (November 4, 2025)

### [📄 Full Application 3 Details](application-3.html)

### Summary
- **Target:** Jacqueline only (CEO and co-founder, 33 years)
- **Events:** End of September 2025
- **Resolution:** September 30 (undertaking given, issue resolved)
- **Filed:** November 4 (35+ days later)
- **Effect:** Complete business isolation, communication only through Peter's attorneys

### Allegations

**"Harassment" of Employees:**
- CEO demanding salary information
- CEO wanting to inform employees about:
  - [Shopify platform ownership](Revenue_Stream/02_Hijacking/SHOPIFY_REVENUE_REVELATION_ANALYSIS.md) by Daniel's UK company
  - RWD ZA has no independent revenue stream
  - [R10.27M documented fraud](Revenue_Stream/02_Hijacking/KEY_EVENTS_TIMELINE_MARCH_AUGUST_2025.md)
  - [ReZonance payment system seizure](evidence/rezonance/FW_RezonceREZONANCE23,24,25FEBS-DanielFaucitt-Outlook.pdf)
  - [Sage accounting takeover](evidence/sage/SAGE_SCREENSHOTS_CONTROL_ANALYSIS.md.pdf)

**"Disruptive" Behavior:**
- CEO requesting to be copied on company correspondence (her fiduciary duty)
- CEO wanting to attend training session (later gave undertaking not to)

### Legal Issues
- **No urgency:** 35+ day delay, issue resolved
- **Self-created urgency:** Tactical to prevent scrutiny
- **Suppression of truth:** Prevents CEO from exposing fraud
- **Legitimate CEO functions:** Characterized as "harassment"

### Curatorship Role
**Phase 3: Delinquency Allegations** - Paint Jacqueline as "dangerous" and "disruptive" to complete narrative for curatorship.

---

## Pattern Analysis: The Curatorship Conspiracy

### Textbook Setup Pattern

The three applications follow the **textbook curatorship conspiracy pattern:**

#### 1. Business Isolation ✓ (Application 1)
**August 13, 2025:** Ex parte interdict separates respondents from business operations.

**Evidence of Pre-Planning:**
- Filed 2 days after trigger event (Jacqueline signs trustee document)
- 36 days after POPIA violation notice
- Material facts concealed from court

#### 2. Medical Labels ✓ (Application 2)
**October 2025:** Settlement enforcement seeks psychiatric evaluation and drug screening.

**Purpose:**
- Label respondents as "incapacitated"
- Create medical basis for curatorship
- Forensic investigation to legitimize false narrative

**Opposition:**
- CIPC backdating fraud discovered
- R500K fabrication exposed
- Respondents withdrew after full disclosure
- ENS Attorneys withdrew (ethical concerns)

#### 3. Delinquency Allegations ✓ (Application 3)
**November 4, 2025:** Contact interdict characterizes legitimate CEO functions as "harassment."

**Purpose:**
- Paint Jacqueline as "dangerous" and "disruptive"
- Complete narrative: "incapacitated" + "delinquent"
- Suppress truth about revenue hijacking and fraud

**Fatal Defect:**
- 35+ day delay = no urgency
- Issue resolved September 30
- Self-created tactical urgency

#### 4. Curatorship Application (Anticipated)
**Expected:** After completing Phases 1-3

**Basis to be Claimed:**
- "Business isolation necessary" (Application 1)
- "Psychiatric incapacity" (Application 2)
- "Delinquent and dangerous" (Application 3)

**Actual Motive:**
- Eliminate R18,685,000 debt to Bantjies
- Seize control of Faucitt Family Trust
- Consolidate revenue stream hijacking

## Conclusion: The Complete Picture

### Three Applications, One Conspiracy

The evidence demonstrates that these are **not three separate disputes** but rather:

1. **Coordinated phases** of a curatorship conspiracy
2. **Systematic pattern** of abuse of process
3. **Progressive escalation** of restrictions
4. **Concealment of fraud** across all applications
5. **Suppression of truth** about revenue hijacking

### The True Story

**March - August 2025:**
- Systematic revenue stream hijacking (R10.27M)
- Shopify platform owned by Daniel's UK company
- RWD ZA has no independent revenue stream
- Peter and Rynette seize operational control

**August - November 2025:**
- Application 1: Isolate from business (concealing facts)
- Application 2: Obtain medical labels (after fraud exposed)
- Application 3: Create delinquency narrative (suppress truth)
- **Next:** Curatorship application (eliminate R18.7M debt)

### Next Steps

**Respondents' Position:**
1. Oppose Application 3 (no urgency, suppression of truth)
2. Maintain opposition to Application 2 (fraud exposed)
3. Seek rescission of Application 1 (material non-disclosure)
4. Expose curatorship conspiracy before curatorship application filed
