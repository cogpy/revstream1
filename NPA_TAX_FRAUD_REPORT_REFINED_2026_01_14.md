'''# NPA Tax Fraud Report - Evidence-Based Submission

**Case Number:** 2025-137857
**Complainant:** Daniel James Faucitt
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Evidence Repository:** [cogpy/ad-res-j7](https://github.com/cogpy/ad-res-j7)

## 1. Introduction

This report details substantial evidence of tax fraud committed by Mr. Peter Andrew Faucitt and his co-conspirators, in contravention of the Tax Administration Act 28 of 2011 and the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962. The evidence indicates a deliberate and systematic scheme to evade taxes through the non-declaration of income and the use of corporate structures to conceal taxable activities.

## 2. Key Parties

| Entity ID | Name | Role | Tax Evasion Activity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PERSON_001** | Peter Andrew Faucitt | Primary Perpetrator, Director | Non-declaration of income |
| **PERSON_002** | Rynette Farrar | Co-conspirator | Aided & Abetted Evasion |
| **ORG_001** | Regima Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd | Vehicle for Fraud | Concealment of Income |
| **ORG_012** | RegimaSA (Pty) Ltd | Shell Company | Obfuscation of financial activity |

## 3. Evasion of Income Tax through Non-Declaration

The primary offense involves the fraudulent diversion and non-declaration of a revenue stream totaling **R10,269,727.90**. This income, rightfully belonging to RegimA Zone Ltd, was hijacked and never declared to the South African Revenue Service (SARS), resulting in a significant loss to the fiscus.

- **Evidence:** The financial records in `ad-res-j7/ANNEXURES/JF03` and the payment redirection evidence in `ad-res-j7/ANNEXURES/JF07` conclusively show the diversion of funds. A full forensic audit, which we request the NPA to initiate, will quantify the exact tax liability.

## 4. Use of Shell Companies to Conceal Taxable Income

The perpetrators made use of corporate entities, most notably RegimaSA (Pty) Ltd, as shell companies to obscure financial activities and evade tax obligations. This entity was incorporated in 2017 but recorded zero revenue and minimal activity, while being involved in a series of inter-company loans and transactions designed to obfuscate the true nature of the group's finances.

- **Evidence:** The financial statements of RegimaSA (Pty) Ltd, found in the `ad-res-j7` repository, show no legitimate business operations. This, coupled with the complex inter-company transactions detailed in `ad-res-j7/ANNEXURES/JF03`, points to a deliberate strategy of using corporate structures to commit tax fraud.

## 5. Conclusion and Request for Prosecution

The evidence demonstrates a clear and willful intent to defraud SARS. The actions of Mr. Faucitt and his co-conspirators constitute serious offenses under South African tax law.

We respectfully request that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), in conjunction with the South African Revenue Service (SARS), conduct a full investigation and prosecute the individuals and entities involved to the fullest extent of the law. The integrity of the national tax system requires that such deliberate and large-scale evasion does not go unpunished.
