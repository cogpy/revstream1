## Significance

This documentation demonstrates the **central fraud**: RWD ZA's entire business model was dependent on infrastructure (Shopify platform) owned, paid for, and operated by RegimA Zone Ltd (UK) for 28+ months. The systematic hijacking of this revenue stream, combined with evidence destruction attempts, supports charges of organized criminal enterprise and consciousness of guilt.

The concentration of Shopify-related events (67% of timeline) proves this is not a business dispute, but systematic theft of revenue generated through infrastructure the perpetrators neither owned nor funded.
