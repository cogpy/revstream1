## 🔍 Critical Revelation

The Shopify platform has been owned and paid for since **July 2023** by Daniel Faucitt's independent UK entity **RegimA Zone Ltd** (28+ months, R140K-R280K total investment). 

**Key Implication:** RWD ZA actually has no revenue stream of its own - all revenues were generated through infrastructure owned, paid for, and operated by Daniel's UK company. RWD merely issued invoices for sales occurring on a platform it neither owned nor funded.

## ⚖️ Significance

This timeline demonstrates **systematic coordination** across multiple crime categories over a 6-month period, with particular emphasis on the critical Shopify platform revelation showing RWD ZA generated no independent revenue. The pattern of events supports charges of:

- Organized criminal enterprise
- Systematic fraud and theft
- Evidence destruction (consciousness of guilt)
- Family conspiracy
- Trust law violations
- Financial crimes

The concentration of Shopify-related events (67% of timeline) underscores the **central fraud:** RWD ZA's business model was entirely dependent on infrastructure owned, paid for, and operated by a third party (RegimA Zone Ltd - UK), undermining any claims of independent business operations or legitimate revenue streams.
