# Revenue Stream Documentation - Index

## Overview

This index provides navigation for comprehensive documentation of the RegimA business case (2025-137857), focusing on the systematic hijacking of revenue streams over a 158-day period (March 15 - August 20, 2025).

## Critical Revelation

The **Shopify platform** has been owned and paid for since **July 2023** by Daniel Faucitt's independent UK entity **RegimA Zone Ltd** (28+ months, R140K-R280K total investment).

**Key Implication:** RWD ZA has no independent revenue stream - all revenues were generated through infrastructure owned, paid for, and operated by Daniel's UK company.

## Significance

This documentation demonstrates **systematic coordination** across multiple crime categories over a 6-month period, with particular emphasis on the critical Shopify platform revelation showing RWD ZA generated no independent revenue.

The concentration of Shopify-related events (67% of timeline) underscores the **central fraud:** RWD ZA's business model was entirely dependent on infrastructure owned, paid for, and operated by a third party (RegimA Zone Ltd - UK), undermining any claims of independent business operations or legitimate revenue streams.

The pattern of events supports charges of organized criminal enterprise, systematic fraud and theft, evidence destruction (consciousness of guilt), family conspiracy, trust law violations, and financial crimes.
