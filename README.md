# Revenue Stream Hijacking Documentation

This repository documents the systematic hijacking of revenue streams in the RegimA business operations case (2025-137857), with a focus on the central fraud involving the Shopify platform and coordinated financial manipulation.

## Critical Revelation

The **Shopify platform** has been owned and paid for since **July 2023** by Daniel Faucitt's independent UK entity **RegimA Zone Ltd** (28+ months, R140K-R280K total investment).

**Key Implication:** RWD ZA actually has no revenue stream of its own - all revenues were generated through infrastructure owned, paid for, and operated by Daniel's UK company. RWD merely issued invoices for sales occurring on a platform it neither owned nor funded.

- **Revenue Theft:** 5 events targeting business operations
- **Trust Violations:** 5 events manipulating family trust structure
- **Financial Manipulation:** 5 events diverting and concealing funds

### 3. Evidence Destruction Pattern
Two critical evidence destruction events demonstrating consciousness of guilt:
- **May 22, 2025:** Shopify audit trail hijacking (platform destruction)
- **August 20, 2025:** Financial evidence concealment (cover-up operations)

### 4. Family Conspiracy Elements
Multiple family members involved in coordinated criminal activity:
- **Peter Faucitt:** Primary perpetrator (11 events)
- **Rynette Farrar:** Co-conspirator (8 events)
- **Addarory (Rynette's son):** Domain registration for identity fraud

- **Duration:** 158 days of documented criminal activity

## Significance

This documentation demonstrates **systematic coordination** across multiple crime categories over a 6-month period, with particular emphasis on the critical Shopify platform revelation showing RWD ZA generated no independent revenue. The pattern of events supports charges of organized criminal enterprise, systematic fraud and theft, evidence destruction (consciousness of guilt), family conspiracy, trust law violations, and financial crimes.

The concentration of Shopify-related events (67% of timeline) underscores the **central fraud:** RWD ZA's business model was entirely dependent on infrastructure owned, paid for, and operated by a third party (RegimA Zone Ltd - UK), undermining any claims of independent business operations or legitimate revenue streams.
