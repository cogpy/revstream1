Dear Sirs,
RE: PETER ANDREW FAUCITT / JACQUELINE FAUCITT & OTHERS
CASE NO: 2025-137857
1. Your client obtained an interdict against our client, Jacqui Faucitt, yet he remains in the
shared residence and is using his presence to intimidate, corner and unsettle her. This will
not be tolerated. If there is one further incident, verbal, physical, indirect or otherwise, we
will take immediate action and enforce our client’s rights.
2. The interdict does not give your client a right to weaponise the living arrangement or to
engage in coercive conduct simply because the order is in his favour. Your client must be
advised accordingly.
3. We also put on record the financial aspect that has now been reported to our client. Emma
Wallis (RegimA Zone UK) has confirmed that revenue processed through eight Shopify
stores, owned and funded by RegimA Zone UK since July 2023, reflects an outstanding
liability of approximately R60 251 961.60, being amounts due from RegimA Worldwide
Distribution which your client has not paid over. In addition, there is approximately $150 000
outstanding in platform fees.

4. Your client’s failure or refusal to deal with these payments places the business and parties
at risk. If he wishes to terminate the longstanding recovery arrangement, then payment must
be made immediately. If payment is not made within 48 hours, we will escalate the matter
without further warning to the necessary parties
5. The withholding of these amounts, while engaging in litigation tactics, will be recorded and
placed before the appropriate forum as part of a pattern of abuse and financial misconduct.
6. We are still taking instructions on the interdict and your client’s conduct taking place inside
the home. A substantive affidavit will follow in due course.
7. We trust your client will be guided accordingly.
8. All of our client’s rights remain strictly reserved.
Yours faithfully,
IAN LEVITT ATTORNEYS
