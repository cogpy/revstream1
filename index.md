## Key Patterns Across All Three Applications

### 1. **Systematic Coordination** 
Timeline reveals coordinated action across three distinct crime categories:
- **Revenue Theft:** 5 events targeting business operations
- **Trust Violations:** 5 events manipulating family trust structure
- **Financial Manipulation:** 5 events diverting and concealing funds

### 2. **Shopify Platform Centrality**
**10 out of 15 events** (67%) directly involve the Shopify platform:
- Platform owned and paid for by RegimA Zone Ltd (UK) since July 2023
- 28+ months of continuous funding (R140K-R280K total investment)
- **Critical implication:** RWD ZA has no independent revenue stream

### 3. **Evidence Destruction Pattern**
Two critical evidence destruction events demonstrating consciousness of guilt:
- **May 22, 2025:** Shopify audit trail hijacking (platform destruction)
- **August 20, 2025:** Financial evidence concealment (cover-up operations)

### 4. **Family Conspiracy Elements**
Multiple family members involved in coordinated criminal activity:
- **Peter Faucitt:** Primary perpetrator (11 events)
- **Rynette Farrar:** Co-conspirator (8 events)
- **Addarory (Rynette's son):** Domain registration for identity fraud

## Significance

This documentation demonstrates **systematic coordination** across multiple crime categories over a 6-month period, with particular emphasis on the critical Shopify platform revelation showing RWD ZA generated no independent revenue.

The concentration of Shopify-related events (67% of timeline) underscores the **central fraud:** RWD ZA's business model was entirely dependent on infrastructure owned, paid for, and operated by a third party (RegimA Zone Ltd - UK), undermining any claims of independent business operations or legitimate revenue streams.

The pattern of events supports charges of organized criminal enterprise, systematic fraud and theft, evidence destruction (consciousness of guilt), family conspiracy, trust law violations, and financial crimes.
