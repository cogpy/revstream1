This document outlines the chronological sequence of events demonstrating the premeditated financial sabotage orchestrated against Daniel Faucitt, culminating in the fraudulent ex parte interdict.

---

## Phase 1: Premeditation and Control Consolidation (March - May 2025)

| Date | Event | Actor(s) | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 28 Mar 2025 | Peter requests to become the SARS Registered Representative for Tax No. 9746755165. | Peter Faucitt | Shows premeditated intent to seize control of the company's tax affairs months before the interdict. |
| 3 Jun 2025 | Bantjies emails Rynette requesting detail on "computer expense line" items. | Danie Bantjies | Suggests an investigation into Daniel's IT expenses was being prepared. |
| 5 Jun 2025 | Rynette emails Bantjies about a SARS query, CC'ing Anton Hechter (SARS official). | Rynette Farrar | Reveals an unusual direct line of communication with a SARS official. The SARS query period was "now closed." |

## Phase 2: The Trigger and Retaliation (6-7 June 2025)

| Date | Event | Actor(s) | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **6 Jun 2025** | **Daniel exposes fraud to Bantjies.** | Daniel Faucitt | The trigger event. Daniel formally reports financial anomalies to the external accountant. |
| **7 Jun 2025** | **Daniel's company debit and credit cards are secretly cancelled.** | Peter Faucitt | Immediate retaliation. This cuts off Daniel's access to company funds for legitimate business expenses, forcing him to use personal funds. |

---

## Phase 3: The Financial Bleed (7 June - 16 July 2025)

With his company cards cancelled, Daniel was forced to pay for critical business infrastructure (Shopify, Github, Microsoft, AI development tools) from his personal accounts.

| Period | Daniel's Personal Savings Transferred to Cover Business Expenses |
| :--- | :--- |
| May - June 2025 | R 210,000 |
| June - July 2025 | R 150,000 |
| July (before 16th) | R 160,000 |
| **Total from Personal Savings** | **R 520,000** |

### The Result: Rock Bottom

On **16 July 2025**, Daniel's personal current account balance hit a low of **R 864.45**. He was personally insolvent from paying company bills.

## Phase 4: The "Evidence" is Created (16 July 2025)

On the same day his account hit R 864.45, Daniel, using his SOLE authority on the Strategic Logistics account, transferred R 500,000 to himself. This was a partial reimbursement for the R 520,000+ he had already spent.

**Peter's Narrative:** He later claimed under oath that this was a "birthday gift" from Jacqueline, which he "did not authorise," and which Daniel "was not entitled to accept."

**The Truth:** Jacqueline did not know about the transfer. Daniel initiated it himself out of necessity. Peter's characterization was a fabrication designed to frame a legitimate reimbursement as theft.

## Phase 5: Blocking the Defense (17-18 June 2025)

| Date | Event | Actor(s) | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 17 Jun 2025 | Peter writes to FNB (Nondu Motlhala) demanding that replacement cards NOT be issued, citing "suspected fraud" and threatening to hold FNB liable. | Peter Faucitt | An attempt to permanently cut off Daniel's access. |
| 18 Jun 2025 | FNB Legal Department responds, confirming the mandate allows any director to act independently. They refuse Peter's demand. | FNB Legal | FNB confirms Daniel's SOLE authority. Peter is told his objection is baseless. |

---

## Phase 6: The Ex Parte Interdict (19 August 2025)

Despite FNB's legal department confirming Daniel's authority, Peter proceeds with the ex parte application.

| Date | Event | Actor(s) | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 19 Aug 2025 | Peter files an ex parte interdict based on the fabricated "birthday gift" narrative. | Peter Faucitt, Elliott Attorneys | The court is misled. Daniel is not present to defend himself. |
| 19 Aug 2025 | The interdict is granted. | High Court | Peter now has a court order to override the banking mandate and seize control. |

## Phase 7: The Real Extraction (3-11 September 2025)

With the interdict in hand, the real asset stripping begins.

| Date | Entity | Transfer Amount | Destination |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3 Sep 2025 | RWD | R 5,164,131.18 | Savings Account |
| 11 Sep 2025 | RST | R 3,090,000.00 | Savings Account |
| 11 Sep 2025 | VVA | R 1,730,000.00 | Savings Account |
| 11 Sep 2025 | SLG | R 640,000.00 | Savings Account |
| **Total** | | **R 10,624,131.18** | |

All operational (CURRENT) accounts were drained to near-zero, while funds were parked in SAVINGS accounts.

## Conclusion: A Manufactured Crisis

The timeline reveals a clear pattern:

1.  **Premeditation:** Peter was consolidating control (SARS representative) months in advance.
2.  **Trigger:** Daniel exposed fraud on 6 June.
3.  **Retaliation:** Cards were cancelled on 7 June.
4.  **Sabotage:** Daniel was forced to bleed his personal savings for 5+ weeks.
5.  **Fabrication:** When Daniel reimbursed himself, Peter called it "extraction."
6.  **Fraud on the Court:** Peter obtained an ex parte order based on a lie.
7.  **Theft:** The interdict was used to extract R 10.6M+ in days.

Daniel's alleged "extraction" of R 500,000 over one month was used to justify Peter's actual extraction of R 10.6M+ in eight days.
