# M-REF 03: Perjury Analysis - The R500,000 "Birthday Gift" Scheme

This document deconstructs the central claim used by Peter Faucitt to obtain the ex parte interdict: the allegation that Daniel Faucitt "extracted" R500,000 from the company as a "birthday gift."

## 1. Peter Faucitt's Sworn Statement

In his founding affidavit (Case 2025-137857), Peter Faucitt makes the following claim under oath at paragraph 7.18:

> "She [Jacqueline Faucitt] adopted an 'I will show you' approach, defended our son, and then **transferred to him the sum of R500,000.00** from the corporations, on or about 16 July 2025, **as a 'birthday gift'**, which **I did not authorise**, and which **he was not entitled to accept**"

This statement contains four key assertions:
1.  Jacqueline transferred the money.
2.  It was a "birthday gift."
3.  Peter did not authorize it.
4.  Daniel was not entitled to accept it.

**The evidence proves every one of these assertions is either false, misleading, or legally irrelevant.**

## 2. The Reality: A Reimbursement Born of Necessity

Analysis of Daniel Faucitt's personal bank statements from June to August 2025 reveals the true context of the 16 July transfer.

### The Sabotage (7 June 2025)

On 7 June 2025, Daniel's company debit and credit cards were secretly cancelled at Peter's instruction. This cut off his access to company funds for legitimate business expenses.

### The Bleed (7 June - 16 July 2025)

For the next 39 days, Daniel was forced to pay for critical business infrastructure (Shopify, Github, Microsoft, AI tools, etc.) from his personal accounts. To do this, he systematically drained his own savings.

| Date | Action | Amount |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 17 Jun | Transfer from Personal Savings | R 50,000.00 |
| 26 Jun | Transfer from Personal Savings | R 50,000.00 |
| 7 Jul | Transfer from Personal Savings | R 70,000.00 |
| 11 Jul | Transfer from Personal Savings | R 40,000.00 |
| 16 Jul | Transfer from Personal Savings | R 50,000.00 |
| **Total** | **From Daniel's Own Savings** | **R 260,000.00** (in this period alone) |

### Rock Bottom (16 July 2025)

On 16 July, after weeks of funding the company out of his own pocket, Daniel's personal current account balance hit a low of **R 864.45**.

| Time | Transaction | Balance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ... | ... | ... |
| 15:XX | POS Purchase Kdz | **R 864.45** |

He was personally insolvent from paying company bills.

### The Transfer (16 July 2025)

Only after hitting rock bottom did Daniel, using his **SOLE Authority** on the Strategic Logistics account, transfer R500,000 to himself. This was not a "gift"; it was a desperate and partial reimbursement.

| Category | Amount |
| :--- | :--- |
| Daniel put IN (from personal savings, May-Jul) | R 520,000.00 |
| Daniel received BACK (from company) | R 500,000.00 |
| **Net Position** | **-R 20,000.00** |

**Even after the R500,000 transfer, Daniel was still R20,000 out of pocket.**

## 3. Deconstruction of Peter's Perjury

| Peter's Claim | The Truth & The Crime |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"She transferred it..."** | **False.** Peter fabricated this to hide his own potential involvement and create a narrative of collusion between Jacqui and Daniel. This is a material falsehood under oath. |
| **"...as a 'birthday gift'"** | **False.** It was a reimbursement for R520,000+ in business expenses that Daniel paid personally. Characterizing it as a "gift" was a deliberate misrepresentation to imply personal enrichment. |
| **"...which I did not authorise"** | **Irrelevant & Misleading.** As established in M-REF 02, Daniel held SOLE authority. Peter's authorization was not required. Stating this implies a need for his authority that did not exist, misleading the court. |
| **"...which he was not entitled to accept."** | **False.** As a director with SOLE authority who had personally funded the company to the tune of R520,000, he was absolutely entitled to reimburse himself. |

## 4. Conclusion: A Manufactured Justification for Theft

Peter Faucitt did not discover Daniel stealing. He engineered a crisis and then framed the inevitable outcome as a crime.

1.  **He created the problem:** Secretly cancelled Daniel's cards.
2.  **He forced the action:** Watched as Daniel was forced to use personal funds.
3.  **He framed the solution:** When Daniel reimbursed himself out of necessity, Peter called it "extraction."
4.  **He committed perjury:** He lied to the court about the nature, origin, and entitlement of the transaction.

This manufactured "emergency" was the sole basis for the urgent ex parte interdict, which was then used to seize control of the company accounts and extract over R10.6 million.

Peter's claim was not a misunderstanding; it was a calculated, fraudulent, and perjured statement at the heart of a criminal conspiracy.
