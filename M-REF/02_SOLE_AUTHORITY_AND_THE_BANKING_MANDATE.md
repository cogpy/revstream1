# M-REF 02: The Fatal Flaw - SOLE Authority vs. Peter's Claims

This document analyzes the FNB banking mandate for Strategic Logistics CC and Regima Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd, which is the central piece of evidence that invalidates the entire premise of the ex parte interdict.

## 1. The Mandate: "Administrator with Sole General Powers"

As confirmed by the FNB FICA/KYC document dated 1 June 2021, all three directors—Peter, Jacqueline, and Daniel Faucitt—were appointed as **"Administrator with Sole General Powers"** on the company accounts.

This is a specific banking term with a precise legal meaning:

*   **Sole:** Each administrator can act alone, unilaterally, and independently.
*   **General:** Their powers are not restricted to specific transaction types or amounts.
*   **Powers:** They can authorize any transaction, make payments, transfer funds, and manage all aspects of the account.

Crucially, this is **NOT** "Equal Authority," which might imply a need for consensus or majority rule. It is **SOLE Authority**.

| Authority Type | Implication |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Equal Authority** | All parties must agree or have a majority vote. Action is collective. |
| **SOLE Authority** | Each individual IS the full, 100% authority. Action is independent and unilateral. |

When an administrator with SOLE authority acts, their action **is** the authorization. The concept of an "unauthorized" transaction by a sole administrator does not exist.

## 2. FNB Legal Department Confirms the Mandate

On 18 June 2025, after Peter Faucitt attempted to block the re-issuance of debit cards, FNB's Business Relationship Manager, Mpumi Netshipale, conveyed the finding of their legal department:

> "Following an engagement with our legal department, a decision was made that we have no need to hold a meeting with the Directors... as **FNB cannot be held liable for acting in accordance with a validly signed mandate.**"

> "**The current mandate states that any of the directors of the company may act independently of each other.** If the current CAR mandate no longer suits the needs of the company, then the directors must change it – by providing us with a resolution to that effect."

FNB's own legal team confirmed that:
1.  The mandate was valid.
2.  It allowed for independent action by any director.
3.  The only way to change this was a **company resolution**, not a unilateral demand from one director.

## 3. The Fatal Flaw in Peter's Interdict

The entire basis for Peter's "urgent" ex parte application rested on his sworn statement that Daniel was "extracting" funds that he "did not authorise."

| Peter's Claim (Founding Affidavit) | The Legal Reality (Banking Mandate) |
| :--- | :--- |
| "...which **I did not authorise**..." | **Irrelevant.** Peter's authorization was never required under a SOLE authority mandate. |
| "...and which **he was not entitled to accept**." | **False.** As an Administrator with Sole General Powers, Daniel was contractually entitled to make or receive any transfer. |

Peter's argument was legally meaningless. He asked the court to interdict Daniel for exercising powers that Daniel was **contractually and legally entitled to exercise** according to the bank's own mandate.

## 4. Conclusion: Abuse of Process to Steal Legal Rights

Peter Faucitt knew, or should have known (especially after FNB's legal department told him on 18 June), that he had no legal basis to challenge Daniel's authority over the accounts. The banking mandate was clear.

Since he could not legally change the mandate via a company resolution, he used the court system to achieve the same goal through an ex parte interdict based on a false premise.

The interdict was not obtained to prevent "unauthorized extraction." It was obtained to **unlawfully strip Daniel of his SOLE authority**, which was a pre-existing legal and contractual right.

This action represents a profound abuse of the court process: using a court order to override a valid contract (the banking mandate) and to steal the legal rights of a co-director.
