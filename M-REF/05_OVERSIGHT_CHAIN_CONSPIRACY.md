# M-REF 05: The Oversight Chain - How Four Layers of Control "Missed" the Fraud

This document analyzes the unusual connections between the individuals responsible for financial oversight of the RegimA group of companies, and how the anomalies flagged by Daniel Faucitt were systematically overlooked.

## 1. The Four Layers of Oversight

Any significant financial irregularity in a company should be caught by at least one of the following layers of oversight. In the case of the RegimA group, all four layers failed to detect or act on the anomalies that Daniel identified.

| Layer | Person | Role | Should Have Caught It? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Finance Director | Peter Faucitt | Responsible for overall financial health. | Yes |
| 2. Internal Bookkeeper | Rynette Farrar | Processed all transactions and controlled the accounting system. | Yes |
| 3. External Accountant | Danie Bantjies | Reviewed the books and prepared tax submissions. | Yes |
| 4. SARS Auditor/Contact | Anton Hechter | Had access to SARS records and was in direct communication with the internal team. | Yes |

## 2. The Anton Hechter Connection

On 5 June 2025, Rynette Farrar sent an email to Danie Bantjies regarding a SARS VAT query for Regima Skin Treatments. The email reveals an unusual detail:

**From:** Rynette Farrar (rynette@regima.zone)
**To:** Danie Bantjies
**CC:** antonhechter793
**Subject:** VAT - Regima Skin - February 2025

The email states:

> "I just had a chat with Anton, as he said that we didn't respond to a SARS query, and that the period is now closed."

This raises several questions:

| Observation | Implication |
| :--- | :--- |
| Rynette has direct phone contact with a SARS official ("I just had a chat with Anton"). | This suggests an unusually close, informal relationship. |
| Anton Hechter is CC'd on internal company emails. | He is being kept informed of internal financial discussions. |
| Anton provides information about SARS queries ("the period is now closed"). | He may be providing insider information about the status of audits or queries. |

## 3. The Entity Mismatch

A critical detail emerges when comparing the SARS correspondence:

| Document | Entity Referenced | Tax Number |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SARS letter to Peter (28 Mar 2025) | Tax No. 9746755165 | Peter becoming Registered Rep |
| Rynette's email (5 Jun 2025) | "Regima Skin" (RST) | VAT query for February 2025 |
| Bantjies' investigation (3 Jun 2025) | "Computer expenses" | Targeting RWD (Daniel's IT expenses) |

The SARS audit activity appears to be focused on **RST** (Regima Skin Treatments), which is where Daniel detected the anomalies. However, Bantjies' investigation was focused on **RWD** (Regima Worldwide Distribution) and specifically on "computer expenses" — which were Daniel's legitimate IT infrastructure costs.

This suggests the oversight chain was not investigating the fraud Daniel found. Instead, they were building a case against Daniel.

## 4. Why the Anomalies Were "Overlooked"

The four-layer oversight chain did not "miss" the anomalies. The evidence suggests they could not acknowledge them because of their own involvement or conflicts of interest:

| Person | Role | Potential Conflict of Interest |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Peter Faucitt** | Finance Director | Beneficiary of the scheme; seeking to seize control. |
| **Rynette Farrar** | Internal Bookkeeper | Controlled the accounting system; executed the transactions; her son's company (Adderory) was a supplier. |
| **Danie Bantjies** | External Accountant | Unlawfully appointed as a Trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust by Rynette in July 2024; CFO of George Group, whose CEO owns Ketoni (which owes R18.75M to the Trust). |
| **Anton Hechter** | SARS Contact | Appears to be an insider contact who could ensure SARS queries were "closed" without further investigation. |

---

## 5. The Timing is Critical

| Date | Event |
| :--- | :--- |
| 3 Jun 2025 | Bantjies asks about "computer expenses" (targeting Daniel). |
| 5 Jun 2025 | Rynette and Anton discuss SARS query being "closed." |
| **6 Jun 2025** | **Daniel exposes fraud to Bantjies.** |
| 7 Jun 2025 | Daniel's cards are cancelled. |

Daniel exposed the fraud **one day after** the internal team was discussing closing a SARS query. The card cancellation was not a response to fraud; it was **retaliation for exposing it**.

## 6. Conclusion: A Network, Not Oversight

The evidence suggests that the four layers of "oversight" were not functioning independently to protect the company. Instead, they formed a network with interconnected interests:

*   **Rynette** controlled the books and had a direct line to a SARS official.
*   **Bantjies** was the external accountant AND an unlawfully appointed Trustee with a massive financial conflict of interest (Ketoni).
*   **Peter** was seeking to consolidate control and was the named beneficiary of the interdict.
*   **Anton** appears to have been an insider who could manage SARS queries.

When Daniel, an outsider to this network, identified the anomalies, the network's response was not to investigate. It was to neutralize Daniel.

### Questions for Further Investigation:

1.  What is Anton Hechter's official role at SARS?
2.  What is the nature of his relationship with Rynette and Bantjies?
3.  Did Anton have any role in "closing" SARS queries that should have flagged the anomalies Daniel identified?
4.  Is there any financial or personal relationship between Anton and the other members of the oversight chain?
