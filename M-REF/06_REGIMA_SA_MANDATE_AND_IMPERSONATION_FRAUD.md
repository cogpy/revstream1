# M-REF 06: RégimA SA "ANY TWO TOGETHER" Mandate and Impersonation Fraud

## Executive Summary

RégimA SA (Pty) Ltd operates under an **"ANY TWO TOGETHER"** banking mandate, fundamentally different from the "SOLE" authority mandates on other entities. This mandate requires **two authorized signatories** for any transaction. Combined with evidence that Peter "doesn't use email or computers" and that Rynette controls pete@regima.com, this reveals a systematic fraud involving impersonation, forgery, and unauthorized transactions.

---

## 1. The "ANY TWO TOGETHER" Mandate

### What It Means

Unlike Strategic Logistics CC where each administrator has **SOLE** authority (can act independently), RégimA SA requires:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Two signatures** | Every transaction requires two authorized signatories |
| **No unilateral action** | No single person can authorize transactions alone |
| **Mutual consent** | Both signatories must agree to any action |

### Authorized Representatives (March 2021 FNB Documents)

| Name | Capacity | Authority |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT** | Director | Signatory |
| **PETER ANDREW FAUCITT** | Director | Signatory |

**Only Daniel and Peter are authorized signatories. Rynette is NOT on the mandate.**

---

## 2. Comparison: SOLE vs ANY TWO TOGETHER

| Entity | Mandate Type | Implication |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Strategic Logistics CC | **SOLE** | Any administrator can act independently |
| Villa Via | **SOLE** | Any administrator can act independently |
| RégimA Skin Treatments CC | **SOLE** | Any administrator can act independently |
| **RégimA SA (Pty) Ltd** | **ANY TWO TOGETHER** | Requires Daniel + Peter for any action |

### Why This Matters

For RégimA SA, **Daniel's consent was legally required** for:
- Any payment authorization
- Any account changes
- Any fund transfers
- Any mandate modifications
- **Any revenue stream diversion**

---

## 3. The ABSA Diversion (March 2025)

### The Unauthorized Action

On or around **1 March 2025**, RégimA SA's revenue stream was diverted to an ABSA account controlled by Rynette — **without Daniel's knowledge or consent**.

### The Legal Problem

| Requirement | Reality |
|-------------|---------|
| Two signatures needed | Daniel did not consent |
| Peter must sign | Peter "doesn't use computers" |
| Rynette not authorized | She's not on the mandate |

### The Fraud Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Rynette Forged Peter's Authorization

If Peter truly doesn't use computers:
- Rynette controls pete@regima.com
- Rynette impersonated Peter digitally
- Rynette "signed" as Peter without his knowledge or participation

**Crimes committed:**
- Forgery
- Identity theft
- Fraud
- Unauthorized mandate change

#### Scenario B: Peter Participated (Contradicting His Claim)

If Peter authorized the diversion:
- His claim of digital incompetence is false
- He's been lying to the court
- He's complicit in excluding Daniel

**Crimes committed:**
- Perjury
- Breach of fiduciary duty
- Conspiracy to defraud

#### Scenario C: Bank Accepted Single Signature

If FNB accepted a transaction without two signatures:
- The bank violated its own mandate requirements
- The bank may be liable for the unauthorized transaction

---

## 4. Peter's Digital Incompetence Claim

### The Claim

Peter has represented (explicitly or implicitly) that he does not use email or computers.

### The Evidence

| Evidence | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| pete@regima.com is controlled by Rynette | Peter doesn't access his own email |
| Digital transactions occur under Peter's name | Someone else is acting as Peter |
| Sage screenshots show Rynette controlling Peter's email | Documented impersonation |

### The Dilemma

If Peter's claim is **TRUE**:
- Rynette has been committing forgery/impersonation
- All digital authorizations "by Peter" are fraudulent
- The ABSA diversion was unauthorized

If Peter's claim is **FALSE**:
- Peter has been lying to the court (perjury)
- Peter is complicit in excluding Daniel
- Peter's founding affidavit contains material misrepresentations

**Either way, crimes have been committed.**

## 5. Rynette's Unauthorized Role

### What Rynette Controls

| System/Account | Rynette's Access |
|----------------|------------------|
| pete@regima.com | Full control |
| Company bank accounts | Operational access |
| Xero/Sage accounting | Administrator |
| ABSA account (revenue diversion) | Controller |

### What Rynette Is NOT

| Role | Status |
|------|--------|
| Director of RégimA SA | **NO** |
| Authorized signatory on FNB mandate | **NO** |
| Shareholder of RégimA SA | **NO** |
| Legally authorized to act for Peter | **NO** |

### The Impersonation

Rynette has been:
1. Sending emails as "Peter" from pete@regima.com
2. Authorizing transactions in Peter's name
3. Making decisions attributed to Peter
4. Controlling accounts she has no legal authority over

**This is systematic identity fraud.**

---

## 6. The Warehouse Blocking

### The Action

Peter (or someone acting as Peter) has blocked the warehouse from fulfilling orders for RégimA SA Shopify.

### The Legal Problems

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Sabotaging own company** | Peter owns 50% of RégimA SA |
| **Harming Daniel's interest** | Daniel owns 50% and is CEO/MD |
| **Breach of fiduciary duty** | Directors must act in company's interest |
| **Potential contempt** | May violate court orders |

### The Question

If Peter "doesn't use computers," who gave the order to block fulfillment?

---

## 7. Timeline of RégimA SA Control Seizure

| Date | Event | Actor |
|------|-------|-------|
| Mar 2021 | RSA set up with Daniel as CEO/MD, Primary Contact, 50% owner | Daniel/Peter |
| Mar 2021 | "ANY TWO TOGETHER" mandate established | FNB |
| Mar 2025 | Peter requests SARS rep status for RSA (Tax No. 9746755165) | Peter |
| **Mar 2025** | **Revenue diverted to ABSA without Daniel's consent** | **Rynette?** |
| Jun 2025 | Daniel's cards cancelled | Peter |
| Aug 2025 | Ex parte interdict granted | Peter |
| 2025 | Warehouse blocked from fulfilling RSA orders | Peter? |

---

## 8. Criminal Implications

### For Rynette

| Crime | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Forgery** | Signing/authorizing as Peter |
| **Identity theft** | Using Peter's identity for transactions |
| **Fraud** | Obtaining benefits through deception |
| **Unauthorized access** | Controlling accounts without authority |

### For Peter

| Crime | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Perjury** | False statements about digital competence |
| **Breach of fiduciary duty** | Acting against company/co-director interests |
| **Conspiracy** | Working with Rynette to defraud Daniel |
| **Fraud on the court** | Material misrepresentations in founding affidavit |

### For Both

| Crime | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Conspiracy to defraud** | Coordinated scheme to exclude Daniel |
| **Theft** | Taking control of Daniel's 50% interest |
| **Abuse of process** | Using courts to legitimize fraud |

---

## 9. Evidence Required

### To Prove the Fraud

1. **FNB records** — Who authorized the ABSA diversion?
2. **IP logs for pete@regima.com** — Who actually accesses this email?
3. **Bank audit trail** — All RSA account changes since March 2021
4. **ABSA account details** — Who controls the diversion account?
5. **Warehouse communications** — Who ordered the fulfillment block?
6. **Sage/Xero audit logs** — Who has been acting as Peter?

### Key Questions for Discovery

1. Has Peter ever personally accessed online banking for RSA?
2. Has Peter ever personally sent an email from pete@regima.com?
3. Who authorized the March 2025 ABSA diversion?
4. Did Daniel consent to any mandate changes after March 2021?
5. Who gave the instruction to block warehouse fulfillment?

---

## 10. Legal Significance

### The "ANY TWO TOGETHER" Mandate Proves:

1. **Daniel's consent was REQUIRED** for any RSA account changes
2. **The ABSA diversion was unauthorized** — Daniel didn't sign
3. **Either Rynette forged Peter's signature, OR Peter lied about not using computers**
4. **The bank may have violated its own mandate requirements**

### This Destroys Peter's Case Because:

1. Peter claims Daniel was "extracting" money — but Daniel had SOLE authority on those accounts
2. Peter claims urgency — but he was simultaneously diverting RSA revenue without consent
3. Peter claims to protect the companies — but he's sabotaging RSA by blocking fulfillment
4. Peter claims Daniel acted without authorization — but Peter's own "authorizations" may be forged

---

## 11. Cross-References

- **M-REF 02:** SOLE Authority analysis (contrast with ANY TWO TOGETHER)
- **M-REF 03:** Perjury analysis (Peter's false statements)
- **M-REF 04:** Financial sabotage timeline
- **M-REF 05:** Oversight chain conspiracy (Rynette's role)

---

## 12. Conclusion

The **"ANY TWO TOGETHER"** mandate on RégimA SA is the key that exposes the fraud:

1. **Any action on RSA without Daniel's signature was unauthorized**
2. **Rynette has been impersonating Peter to circumvent the mandate**
3. **Peter's claim of digital incompetence is either true (proving Rynette's forgery) or false (proving Peter's perjury)**
4. **The March 2025 ABSA diversion was a criminal act**

**The very mandate structure Peter established to protect the company is now the evidence that proves the fraud against Daniel.**
