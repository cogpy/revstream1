## Core Thesis

The ex parte interdict obtained by Peter Faucitt on 19 August 2025 was not a legitimate legal remedy to protect the companies. It was the culmination of a premeditated scheme to:

1.  **Sabotage Daniel financially** by secretly cancelling his company cards.
2.  **Force him to use personal funds** to pay for business expenses.
3.  **Frame his necessary reimbursement as "extraction"** by fabricating the "birthday gift" narrative.
4.  **Obtain a court order based on perjury** to override Daniel's legitimate SOLE authority.
5.  **Use the court order to steal millions** from the company accounts.

## Critical Distinction: SOLE vs ANY TWO TOGETHER

A key discovery is the difference in banking mandates across entities:

| Entity | Mandate Type | Implication |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Strategic Logistics CC | **SOLE** | Any administrator can act independently |
| RégimA Skin Treatments CC | **SOLE** | Any administrator can act independently |
| Villa Via | **SOLE** | Any administrator can act independently |
| **RégimA SA (Pty) Ltd** | **ANY TWO TOGETHER** | Requires Daniel + Peter for any action |

This means:
- On **SOLE** mandate accounts, Daniel's actions were **pre-authorized** by the mandate itself
- On **ANY TWO TOGETHER** accounts (RSA), Daniel's consent was **legally required** for any transaction
- The March 2025 ABSA diversion on RSA was **unauthorized** because Daniel didn't consent

## The Impersonation Fraud

Peter claims he "doesn't use email or computers." This creates a dilemma:

| If TRUE | If FALSE |
|---------|----------|
| Rynette has been impersonating Peter | Peter has been lying to the court |
| All digital "Peter" authorizations are forged | Peter is complicit in excluding Daniel |
| The ABSA diversion was unauthorized | Peter committed perjury |

**Either way, crimes have been committed.**
